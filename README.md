Title: Generating monologue of political speeches

Some of the most important speeches are the ones that national leaders make for political reasons.
They are extremely powerful as they directly impact the lives of not only the citizens of the country
but also international relations with other nations and their masses as well. Throughout history,
we have noticed political speeches being used to motivate the population, begin revolutionary movements, even start and end wars.
The reason why political speeches are so powerful is twofold. Firstly, the script itself is designed and
written in such a way that it stirs the emotions of the audience and leaves them thinking or wanting
to act. Secondly, the political leader is a great orator. He/She/They/Them deliver the speech in
such a manner that every single word they say sounds convincing and makes the audience want to
believe in their cause.

In this project, we build a system that can learn the art of writing political speeches and generate
a speech that is very identical to that given by two current world leaders, namely Prime Minister
Narendra Modi (current PM of India) and President Joe Biden (current President of the United
States). By combining the domains of Deep Learning and Natural Language Generation, the model
learns patterns and usage of words over the speeches made by a political leader in the past. It then
uses this context to generate new text for the specified seed.
