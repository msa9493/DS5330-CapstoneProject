       "'good morning today pleased to announce that after months of tough and thoughtful negotiations think we have an historic know we have historic economic framework it framework that will create millions of jobs grow the economy invest in our nation and our people turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us in path not only to compete but to win the economic competition for the st century against china and every other major country in the world it fiscally responsible it fully paid for nobel prize winners and economics have said it will lower the inflationary pressures on the economy and over the next years it will not add to the deficit at all it will actually reduce the deficit according to the economists want to thank my colleagues in the congress for their leadership we spent hours and hours and hours over months and months working on this no one got everything they wanted including me but that what compromise is that consensus and that what ran on ve long said compromise and consensus are the only way to get big things done in democracy important things done for the country know it hard know how deeply people feel about the things that they fight for but this framework includes historic investments in our nation and in our people any single element of this framework would fundamentally be viewed as fundamental change in america taken together they re truly consequential ll have more to say after return from the critical meetings in europe this week but for now let me lay out few points first we face and apologize for saying this again we face an inflection point as nation for most of the th century we led the world by significant margin because we invested in our people not only in our roads and in our highways and in our bridges but in our people in our families we didn just build an interstate highway system we built highway to the sky we invested to win the space race and we won we were also among the first to provide access to free education for all americans beginning back in the late hundreds that decision alone to invest in our children and their families was major part of why we were able to lead the world for much of the th century but somewhere along the way we stopped investing in ourselves investing in people america is still the largest economy in the world we still own the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world but we risk losing our edge as nation our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world today according to the world economic forum we ranked th in the world we used to lead the world in educational achievement now the organization for economic cooperation and development ranks america th out of the major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care and we know how where children start impacts significantly in how they ll finish we can be competitive in the st century global economy if we continue this slide that what ve said all along we need to build america from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down with the trickle down economics that always failed us can think of single time when the middle class has done well that the wealthy haven done very well can think of many times including now when the wealthy the super wealthy do very well and the middle class don do well that why proposed the investments congress is now considering in two critical pieces of legislation positions ran on as president positions announced when laid out in joint session of congress what my economic agenda was these are not about left versus right or moderate versus progressive or anything else that pits americans against one another this is about competitiveness versus complacency competitiveness versus complacency it about expanding opportunity not opportunity denied it about leading the world or letting the world pass us by today with my democratic colleagues we have framework for my build back better initiative and here how it will fundamentally change the lives of millions of people for the better millions of you are in the so called sandwich generation who feel financially squeezed by raising child and caring for an aging parent about seniors in america and people with disabilities have applied for medicaid and they re on waiting list right now to get home care they need some help they don have be kicked out of their homes but they need little help getting around having their meals made occasionally for them they don want to put them in nursing homes not because of the cost but because it matter of dignity they want to stay in their homes but it hard you re just looking for an answer so your parents can keep living independently with dignity for millions of families in america this this issue is the most important issue they re facing it personal so here what we re going to do we re going to expand services for seniors so families can get help from well trained well paid professionals to help them take care of their parents at home to cook meals for them to get their groceries for them to help them get around to help them live in their own home with the dignity they deserve to be afforded quite frankly what we found is that this is more popular or as popular as anything else we re proposing because the american people understand the need it matter of dignity and pride for our parents years ago we ranked number seven among the advanced economies in the world as share of women working know where we are today we rank rd rd seven to once again our competitors are investing and we re standing still today there are nearly two million women in america not working today simply because they can afford childcare typical family spends about year on childcare some states it year per child we re going to make sure nearly all families earning less than year will pay no more than of their income for childcare and for family making hundred thousand dollars year that will save them more than in childcare this is fundamental game changer for families and for our economy as more parents especially women can get back to work and work in the workforce looking at lot of significant press people in front of me lot of them are working working mothers they know what it costs remember when got to the senate lost my wife and daughter in an accident my two boys started commuting miles day because had my mom and my dad and my brother and my sister to help me take care of my kids because couldn afford childcare and was getting serious salary year we ve also extended the historic middle class tax cut that what call it middle class tax cut for parents that is the expanded child tax credit we passed through the american rescue plan what that means is for folks at home they re getting month for every child under the age of six for every child under the age of we re extending that for another year the money is already life changer for so many working families this will help cut child poverty in half this year according to experts but that not all it does it changes the whole dynamic for working parents in the past if you paid taxes and had good income you could deduct under the tax code per child from the taxes you owed but how many families do you know are cashier or waiters healthcare workers who never out the benefit of the full tax credit because they didn have that much to deduct and it wasn refundable so it either came off your tax bill or you didn get full credit why should if somebody making year or or year get to write it off their taxes and the people who need the help even more they don have that much tax to pay they don get the benefit and they have the same cost of raising their children of those left out were working parents who just didn make enough money that why in the american rescue plan we didn just expand the amount of the middle class tax cut we also made it refundable this framework will make it permanently refundable making sure the families who need it get full credit for it in addition to those who are already getting full credit they re going to make sure that every three and four year old child in america go to high quality preschool that part of the legislation just brought up to the congress studies show that when we put three and four year olds in school school not daycare school we increase by up to the chance that that child no matter what their background we ll be able to earn college degree as my wife jill who is in the back here always says any country that out educates us is going to out compete us we can finally take us from years to years of universal education in america we also make investments in higher education by increasing pell grants to help students from lower income families attend community college and four year schools and we invest in historically black universities colleges universities hbcus minority serving institutions and tribal colleges to make sure every young student has shot at good paying job in the future this framework extends tax credits to lower premiums for folks who are in the affordable care act for another three years for million folks in the states that haven expanded medicaid all the rest have this framework will enable you to get affordable coverage and medicare will now cover the cost of hearing aids and hearing checkups this framework also makes the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis ever ever happened beyond any other advanced nation in the world over billion metric tons of emission reductions at least times bigger on climate than any bill that has ever passed before and enough to position us for to emission reductions by the year and we ll do it in ways that grow the domestic industries create good paying union jobs address long standing environmental injustices as well tax credit to help people do things like weatherize their homes so they lose less energy install solar panels and develop clean energy products and help businesses produce more clean energy and when paired with the bipartisan infrastructure bill we will truly transform this nation historic investments in passenger rail know everybody says oh biden rail guy that true but passenger rail and freight rail and public transit it going to take hundreds of thousands of vehicles off the road saving millions of barrels of oil everybody knows all the studies show if you can get from point to point on electric rail you won drive your car you ll take the rail service we also learned that in most major cities in america minority populations the jobs they used to have in town they re now out of town roughly of the folks they don have vehicles so they need to have means to get out of town to their jobs to be on time this will do that like it did for detroit of the school buses in america run on diesel every day more than million children and thousands of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school from the diesel exhaust we re going to replace thousands of these with electric school buses that have big batteries underneath and that are good for the climate went down to one of the manufacturing facilities saw them got in one drive them they do not expend any they do not expend any pollution into the air we ll build out the first ever national network of electric vehicle charging stations all across the country so when you buy an electric vehicle and you get credit for buying it you buy electric vehicle you go all the way across america on single tank of gas figuratively speaking it not gas you plug it in of them these stations along the way we re going to get off the sidelines on manufacturing solar panels and wind farms and electric vehicles with targeted manufacturing credits you manufacture you get credit for doing it these will help grow the supply chains in communities too often left behind and we re going to reward countries for paying good wages for companies should say for good wages and for sourcing their materials from here in the united states that means tens of millions of panels and turbines doubling the number of electric vehicles we have on the road within just three years we ll be able to sell and export these products and technologies to the rest of the world and creating thousands more jobs because we are once again going to be the innovators we ll also make historic investments in environmental cleanup and remediation that means putting people to work in good paying jobs at prevailing wage capping hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells and gas wells oil and gas wells that need to be capped because they are leaking things that hurt the air putting stop to the methane leaks and in the pipelines protecting the health of our communities it big deal and we ll build up our resilience for the next super storm drought wildfires and hurricanes that represent blinking code red for america and the world last year alone these types of extreme weather events you ve all been covering and you ve all witnessed and some of you have been caught in the middle of have caused billion in damage to the united states within the last year billion and we re not spending any money to deal with this this is costing us significantly met in pittsburgh met an ibw electrical worker who climbs up in those power lines in the middle of the storm to try to put transformers in to keep the lights on when storms hit he calls himself hundred percent union guy his job dangerous as he said quote don want my kids growing up in world where the threat of climate change hangs over their heads end of quote folks we all have that obligation that obligation to our children and to our grandchildren the bipartisan infrastructure bill was also the most significant investment since we built the interstate highway system and won the space race decades ago this is about rebuilding the arteries of our economy across the country now there are bridges and thousand miles of roads that are in poor condition some of the bridges you don even take chance of going across they ve shut down they can be built back to the same standard because the weather not going to get lot better we just got to keep it from getting heck of lot worse we have to build back better and stronger no one should have to hold their breath as they cross rundown bridge or dangerous intersection in their hometown we re going to put hard working americans on the job to bring our infrastructure up to speed good union jobs at prevailing wages jobs you can raise the family on and my dad would say you could have little breathing room jobs that can be outsourced jobs replacing lead water pipes so families can drink clean water improving the health of our children and putting plumbers and pipe fitters to work jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines to build modern energy grid jobs making high speed internet affordable and available everywhere in rural and urban america particularly including the of rural america that goes without it right now this pandemic has made clear the need for affordable and available high speed internet the idea of parent having to put their kids in the car for virtual learning drive and sit in the mcdonald parking lot so the child can access the internet when school is taught virtually is not only unnecessary it just wrong it wrong as said before these plans are fiscally responsible they are fully paid for they don add single penny to the deficit they don raise taxes on anyone making less than year in fact they reduced the deficit here how don want to punish anyone success capitalist want everyone to be able to if they want to be millionaire or billionaire to be able to seek their goal but all asking is pay your fair share pay your fair share pay your fair share and right now many are paying virtually nothing last year the most profitable corporations in america of them paid zero zero in federal income tax on about billion in profit if they report big profits to their shareholders they should be paying taxes it that simple that why the build back better framework will have minimum on the largest corporations minimum tax of the top of the wealthiest americans evade it estimated by the experts billion year in federal taxes that wrong we re going to change that want to emphasize what said from the beginning under my plans if you earn less than you won pay single penny more in federal taxes period in fact these bills continue cutting taxes for middle class for childcare for healthcare so much more let me close with this for much too long working people of this nation in the middle class of this country have been dealt out of the american deal it time to deal them back in ran for president saying it was time to reduce the burden on the middle class to rebuild the backbone of this nation working people and the middle class couldn have been any clearer from the very moment announced my candidacy that why wrote these bills in the first place and took them to the people campaigned on them and the american people spoke this agenda the agenda that in these bills is what million americans voted for more people voted than any time in american history that what they voted for their voices deserve to be heard not denied or worse ignored because here what know we make these investments there will be no stopping the american people or america we will own the future ve long said it never been good bet to bet against the american people ve said that to foreign leaders as well as everyone here in this country which means it always good bet to bet on the american people just give them half chance and that what we re doing that what these plans do they re about betting on america about believing in america about believing in the capacity of the american people if you look at the history of the journey of this nation what becomes crystal clear is this ll say it again given half chance the american people have never ever ever ever let the country down so let get this done god bless you all and may god protect your troops and ll see you in italy and in scotland thank you yeah hello michigan it good to be back it really is and john thank you for that introduction truth of the matter is is the reason why the american labor movement across the board has the single best workers in the world because you re the best trained wish the american people understood how much serious serious training goes into being union worker really mean it you re the best in the world was kidding someone said to me earlier that said union president president who supports unions not labor unions and someone pointed out to me that allegedly have used the word union as president more than the last seven presidents combined you built the country no not joke you have built the country and it great to be here with several excellent members of congress elissa slotkin alyssa you don want to screw around with her she an intelligence officer as well so she forgotten more than most of you know but thanks for riding out with me and thanks for the advice you ve given me and mean that sincerely and how we re going to make sure that everything we do here is paid for and not single penny raised in taxes of anybody making under debbie you re the best in the world you and john have been friends of mine for so so long you ve stepped in and taken over in way that think has had to be both emotionally difficult but you ve done an incredible job and consider you one of my great friends thank you dan you re okay dan you ain quite like the woman sitting next to you but all kidding aside dan you ve done great really mean it you re always there for everything it important to constituents and you understand what going to talk about little bit later the way we built this country is from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down and you get it andy as my dad would say you got good blood kid and thank you for what you re doing thank you for stepping in and thank you for the great job you do michigan it also fortunate to have an outstanding united states senators who are doing what they re supposed to do they re in washington because the senate in debbie and gary are in washington now to cast some really important votes to keep things moving and of course it great to be with my friend we become friends an outstanding governor one of the best governors in the united states of america and her lieutenant governor who covers her in every way both in terms of physically and mentally and every other way and thank you for all you did to help me get elected really mean it thank you thank you thank you look know there lot of noise in washington there always is but it seems to me little more than usual now whole lot of hyperbole lot of heat and here today to try to set some things straight if can want to talk about what fundamentally at stake for our country now at this moment know it an overused phrase but ve been using it lot we re at an inflection point anywhere from to years in america there an inflection point we have to choose what direction we re going to go what we re going to do not democrat republican but who we going to be for long time america set the pace across the entire globe for the better part of the th century we led the world by significant margin in investments in ourselves in our people in our country we invested in our infrastructure in our roads highways bridges ports airports and the arteries of the nation that allow commerce to function smoothly and swiftly and allow us to generate significant income we ve invested in our people and opportunity we re among the first to provide access for example to free education it the reason why in the th century we began to take off it was back in the late we decided among the first countries that we were going to be the first nation that every single american regardless of their background wasn at time regardless of their background but based on income would have free years of education we invested to win the space race we led the world in research and development which led to the creation of the internet but then something happened we slowed up we stopped investing in ourselves america still the largest economy in the world we still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world but we re risk losing our edge as nation our infrastructure used to be the best in the world literally not figuratively today according to the world economic forum we rank th our infrastructure nations have better infrastructure than we do which means they can move product they can do so many things better than we can do it we re among the first in the world to guarantee access to universal education now the organization of economic cooperation and development ranks america th out of major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education as percent of gdp think of that think of that of all the industrial nations in the world the instinct americans would say if you asked them years ago they say we re number one we are not there only two industrial nations that are lower than us all those investments that fueled the strong economy we ve taken our foot off the gas don know what happened the world has taken notice by the way including our adversaries and now they re closing the gap in big way so it essential that we regain our momentum that we ve lost the work of our time it seems to me those of us who hold public office is prepare ourselves to be more competitive and to win the fast changing st century in the global economy things are changing incredibly quickly that why propose two critical pieces of legislation being debated back in washington right now the first bill to invest in our physical infrastructure and the second is the bill to invest in our human infrastructure ll talk about both these bills in just moment but first want to set one thing straight these bills are not about left versus right or moderate versus progressive or anything that pits americans against one another these bills are about competitiveness versus complacency they re about opportunity versus decay they re about leading the world or continue to let the world pass us by which is literally happening so support these investments is to create rising america america that is moving propose these investments is to be complicit in america decline to support these bills and to pursue broader vision of our nation and oppose them is to accept very cramped view of our future this isn about two pieces of legislation it about the inflection point mentioned earlier we are in our history the world history so here what proposing first the infrastructure bill it about rebuilding our roads our highways our bridges our ports our airports our broadband all the things that need repair our arteries of our economy have always been fueled by the economic might and dynamism of americans across the country right now bridges and miles of roads according to engineers inaudible engineers are in poor condition right now including more than bridges as the governor been fighting to repair here in your state miles of roads here in michigan ll bet everyone in this room can tell me what the most dangerous intersection in this town or any town they live in and where it is that you hold your breath when you re driving over trying to cross the street not joke working with the governor and members of the congress here we re going to put hard working americans like the operating engineers here and how on the job to bring back our infrastructure to bring it up to speed good union jobs not prevailing wage jobs wage that gives you dignity that you can raise family on that you can hold your head up this is blue collar blueprint for how we restore america pride these are jobs that can be outsourced we re going to put plumbers and pipe fitters to work replacing lead pipes in america so families and children can drink clean water schools mean it not just our homes it across the country we re going to put line workers and electricians to work laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and to build modern infrastructure and energy grid we re going to make high speed internet affordable and available to everywhere in america we re talking about on the way over with alyssa that how short the number of people have access to the internet here because of the lack of investment we re going to make the largest investment in public transit in american history and we re going to make the most important investment in our rail system since the creation of amtrak years ago let me tell you our competitors aren hanging around and waiting see what we re going to do they ve been pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure and into this training their people for years now take china for example now ve been clear that china uses unfair cosia practices to get ahead into their competitors but that not the whole of the story they also invest in themselves in recent years china has spent around three times as much on infrastructure as share of their economy than we have three times and they re not slowing yesterday my us trade representative delivered an important speech on our competition with china she pointed out that china made major investment in steel plants beginning about years ago in the last years half of american steel companies have been shuttered we went from us steel companies to and employment in american steel industry dropped by since the year china now produces more steel in one month than america does in an entire year you can see it in the sector after sector other countries are speeding up and america falling behind we ve got to reset the pace again we got to set different pace for example here in michigan we need to make sure that american auto workers lead the world electric vehicles and some of you came to the white house when had the chairman of the board of general motors chrysler and ford and what did they decided to do forward and what did they decide to do they decided they were going to lead the world and they were going to build more of the electric vehicles than any other country but guess what china not waiting around they manufacturer more than twice as many electric vehicles as we have over the last decade they control more than of the battery market and they re poised to invest another billion dollars in charging capacity now in their country back in may had the chance to tour ford new state of the art facility in dearborn where union workers are building the first ever all electric ford got to drive that sucker it quick zero to in seconds and it big boy it big one months later hosted the big three auto makers at the white house where the ford was joined by the gmc hummer and the jeep wagoner all going electric all in partnership with the uaw the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric we need to make sure america builds that future instead of falling behind we should build those vehicles and the batteries to get them here in the united states of america that where we should build them here in the state of michigan want those jobs and really mean it want those jobs here in michigan not halfway around the globe that what my plan will do the infrastructure bill will put in motion the union workers on the job installing national network of hundreds of thousands of charging stations along our roads and highways and communities or of them and by the way parenthetically when you build charging station it like back in the day when my grand pop worked for the inaudible oil company back in the turn of the in that area they went from state to state convention people that lot of them put gallons of gasoline under the ground they didn want them around but guess what happened everything builds up around them you put these charging stations along the highway you re going to see significant economic development go well beyond the charging station and the build back better plan will boost our manufacturing capacity investing in new and retool facilities and employ american workers with good wages and benefits that includes grants to kickstart new battery and parts productions purchasing incentives for families to buy clean union made vehicles like the ones championed by debbie and dan and the senate and the house and loans and tax credits to boost clean vehicle manufacturing look these are the kinds of investments that get america back in the game and give our workers chance my plan also makes historic investments in clean energy including tax credits to help people do things like weatherize their homes install solar panels develop clean energy products to help businesses produce more clean energy all told this project will save literally hundreds of millions of barrels of oil on yearly basis it not joke these credits those credits could cut the cost of installing rooftop solar by about helping families cut the utility bills and helping the country cut its emissions my infrastructure bill will put americans to work in long overdue national environmental cleanups want job corps just like roosevelt wanted job corps but an environmental job corps of over million people that means good jobs and prevailing wages capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil wells we have thousands and thousands of abandoned oil wells and gas wells and methane with methane leaks guess what the miners and the people who dug those wells they ll get paid the same amount of money to cap them now it going to help us meet the moment of the climate crisis and do away with it going to create good jobs make us more economically competitive folks here in michigan you all know the cost of extreme weather all remember the flooding this summer that shut down parts of the power outages and the tornado warnings they re costing your state billions of dollars nationally last year last year because extreme weather it cost america billion dollars billion tax payers dollars went all over the country went out west to the fires more has burned down in the northwest than the entire state of new jersey that how much we ve lost you see what happened with the droughts that are out there you see reservoirs that are down feet there worried about the cooling down you re worried about what the colorado river going to do this is big deal this is gigantic and we re not going to ease up we re not going to ease up in any of this we have to invest in resilience resilience you saw texas their entire power grid went down because they had no resilience the ability to build back and build things stronger why lot of those fires in the far west because guess what it hell of lot safer to have those wires underground not being knocked down by high winds and tornadoes and the like causing fires look we haven passed major infrastructure bill for decades in this country it used to be normal thing to do it used to be bipartisan thing to do if we get this done we re going to breathe new life into our economy and our workers and we re going to breathe cleaner air economists left right and center agree earlier this year wall street not some liberal think tank wall street and wall street outfit called moody projected that the investments in these bills could help our economy create an additional two million jobs per year every year two million per year that going to be transformative and here the deal the jobs in my plan are people who too often felt left behind and were left behind left out of the jobs in this bill these bills in my infrastructure plan don require four year college degree we need to get this done but it isn enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure we re going to lead the world like we used to if we re going to do that we have to also invest in our people like you do right here in this training facility that why my second bill the build back better plan that what it does take education for example when america said everyone is entitled to years of free public education universal century ago it gave us the best educated best prepared workforce in the world and that was one of the reasons why america began to grow so rapidly it big part of why we led the world the bulk of the th century but guess what if we were going to put together committee today like they did in think it was and we were going to invent public education system is there any chance that we say that we thought years was enough in the st century just years don think so study after study shows that the earlier our children begin to learn in school not daycare the better for themselves for their families no matter what the background they come from no matter what their background recent university studies point out that they re increased by the chance for them to get all the way through years of school without getting in trouble it gigantic deal it doesn matter whether mom or dad no how to read or write or the home is home that is challenging but right now we re lagging behind while other countries are investing in their children today only about half of three and four year olds in america are enrolled in early childhood education in germany france the united kingdom latvia that number more than of their three and four year olds we re falling further and further behind the curve it not just through education according to one study we ranked out of advanced economies when it comes to the percentage of our young people who have obtained post high school degree anything after high school we re at the bottom of the heap bet if that was on quiz you re on one of these quiz shows and they ask you that you would ve said maybe we re two or three or four it ridiculous my build back better plan gets us back on track we ll make four additional years of public education available to every person in america two years of high quality preschool at the front end and investments in community colleges so our students can gain skills they need to carve out place for themselves in the st century economy and also increase pell grants there re grants for kids making families less than grand helping their folks helping them get through community college or historically black colleges in order to be able to get shot so they can live they can eat while they re going to school and we ll invest in historical black college and universities as our central asset to help and support and to make sure the young people of every background and circumstance have shot at good paying jobs look this bill also invests in our workforce by providing so much needed breathing room for working families after all how can we compete in the world if millions of american parents especially moms can join the workforce because they can afford the cost of childcare or elder care and have to stay home for example here in michigan the average two parent family spends on childcare costs for just one child each year years ago the united states ranked sixth sixth among advanced economies and the share of women in the workforce do you know what we are today countries have higher percentage of their women in the workforce making competitive wage than the united states while the competitors are investing in the care economy we re standing still and the fact is millions of american parents are feeling the squeeze they re having hard time doing their job earning paycheck while taking care of their children or aging parents and at the same time in the sandwich generation my build back better plan going to change that because it costs the cost of childcare for most michigan families by more than half it going to extend historic middle class tax cut to the childcare tax credit which we passed in my american rescue plan now most people don know if you walk to the average informed person doctor lawyer or whatever and said childcare tax credit they re not sure what that means but what it means is if you were making decent salary and you had two kids or three kids or four under the age of you get to deduct for each child off your bottom line in your taxes you owe guess what if you re making bucks an hour you don have any taxes to pay like that so guess what you ve got nothing zero zero no help my friends on the other team have no problem giving billionaires and millionaires my friends on the other team have no problem giving billionaires and millionaires gigantic tax breaks this is tax cut what it does is now and it in place and people in your state are understanding it now instead of it provides it upped the ante how much you could get for child under seven you get bucks tax cut on yearly basis and you get for child under but guess what we did that means we re doing on monthly basis now it means you re getting either month or month just like your social security check at home it cut child poverty by that money already life changer for so many working families and as said actually was wrong in michigan it cut in child poverty we need to keep it going my plan is going to put americans to work constructing the rehabilitating safe and affordable housing to help ease the cost of housing while generating even more jobs most of the major metropolitan areas of america you can afford the housing and it helps to meet the moment on climate change as well we re setting the course for america to achieve to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by for us to reach net zero emissions by this bill helps us get there in way that creates good jobs makes us global leaders of fast growing clean energy industries like electric vehicles solar and wind power and battery power the bottom line is this when we give working families break we re not just raising their quality of life we re putting parents in position to earn paycheck we re also positioning our country to compete in the world that what these bills are all about if you want proof just come to this training facility this is where hardworking folks come to learn how to operate road graders and so much more where workers use virtual reality and the master operating crane and they learn how to deal with drones to look underneath the bridges and so on where young people in michigan show up and emerge as expert technicians engineers heavy equipment operators they leave here with shot at something great union job with good wages and benefits that allow them to maintain their dignity and their pride it ticket to the middle class this is where the economy starts with you your skills your dreams and your limitless potential the only thing we ve been missing is the will from washington to finally build an economy around you an economy that gives you and your family fighting chance to get ahead gives our country fighting chance to compete with the rest of the world we can get here thinking small we have to think big let me be clear we need to prepare for years down the line that what these bills do both these bills spend out over years not in the first year so if you take the infrastructure bill folks it described as trillion bill what that means is that of all those investments in road bridges high speed internet water everything else all of it would be less than one half of of our economy each year and it all paid for and they don increase the debt because they re paid for by asking the very wealthy to begin to pay their fair share as matter of fact significant portion of this plan cuts taxes for working people and best of all the cost of these bills in terms of adding to the deficit is zero and made commitment when wrote these when was running no one making under year will see penny in their taxes go up that why in the infrastructure bill there is no gas tax increase because people making under would have to pay more it simple you re working here at this facility your spouse is teacher or firefighter there no reason why combined why millionaires and billionaires in this country should be paying at lower tax rate that you do hear me again now lower tax rate police officer teacher union crane operator and nurse they paid higher tax rate higher tax rate than the significant portion of the major corporations in america and the super wealthy look it isn right is that right that of the largest corporations in america in this country and come from the corporate capital of the world more corporations are incorporated in the state of delaware than every other state combined but you know how much those companies could go on to more than that they made over billion and they paid zero in federal income tax since the pandemic began the number of billionaires and forget the exact number there are in america have seen their wealth go up collectively by trillion it isn fair it needs to change look working folks understand that that why despite the attacks and misinformation my plan has overwhelming support in the polling data from the american people they understand what at stake they understand that workers and families have better shot americans have better shot capitalist think you should be able to go out and make million or one billion but just pay your fair share join the crowd man they know that this is about dignity and respect it about changing the paradigm so the economy works for you not just for those at the very top it about building this economy from the bottom up and the middle out that what ve done my entire career that why ran for president as said capitalist think you should be able to make lot of money in america but just pay your fair share pay your fair share took this agenda to the country they said it was time to build an economy that looks out from scranton pennsylvania where grew up as kid instead of looking down from wall street an economy looks out from howell michigan and towns like it all over america that brings people from every race background religion into the game and not withstanding some of the signs that saw come that why million americans voted for me the largest number of votes in american history clear majority who supported when they supported me look it now time to deliver let me close with this the world watching not joke the autocrats of the world believe the world is moving so rapidly that democracies can generate consensus quickly enough to bring their people together to get things done they think democracy is not joke my meetings with putin my meetings with xi jinping and other leaders they truly believe that we can compete in the st century because things are moving so fast democracies takes so much time that they are so divided that they can get together in time to act they believe they ll win the day and they can dictate their way forward and leave us behind they re betting not joke there they re betting for the first time we weren responding to this inflection point in history that we ll fail to rise to the occasion but you ve heard me say it lot of times it never ever been good bet to bet against the american people never look just look back little ways after world war ii the united states did what we re trying to do now invested in the american people to lead the world at the time presidents and congress of both parties and americans of all political views stepped up not being sentimental here there was racial discrimination it was fact of life we know how deep rooted racism is in this country we saw the klan marching here in howell generations ago and again in recent years it never ending battle but think about what also unfolded in these critical decades great protest movement some of the nations was promised of equity the gi bill sent millions of veterans to college the federal government helped make home ownership possible because it the vehicle by which people can generate wealth most of us who come from lower middle class backgrounds that how our parents were able to generate any wealth the investments in our home for those who could previously only dream of having house to call their own we invested in an interstate highway system propelling our economy into the future we invested in the space race which led to huge strides in technology we invested in something called darpa program within the federal government that helped create the internet folks we need to step up again but the challenge of today is one of economic competition let learn from that history not because it was perfect because americans then did what we must do now invest in ourselves to show the world that american democracy works and if given half chance there nothing not single thing we can achieve when we do it together know we can do this positive we can never been more optimistic about this country than am right now we re going to restore faith pride and dignity the future of this country and we re going to pass both of these bills and start building this economy to beat the competition to deliver for working families thank you may god bless you and may god protect our troops let get this done thank you hello everybody how are you doing did you ever think you be senior press coming to watch someone get shot in the old days me either anyway like did in my first and second covid vaccination shot about to get my booster shot and do it publicly that because the food and drug administration the fda the center for disease control and prevention the cdc looked at all the data completed their review and determined the boosters for the pfizer vaccine others will come later maybe assume but the pfizer vaccine are safe and effective they ve had all the data they need and last week they laid out who is eligible for those boosters for now you re eligible for booster if it been six months since your second pfizer shot and if you fall into one of these categories people over which is hard to acknowledge adults only joking folks adults with certain underlying health conditions like diabetes and obesity and those who are at increased risk of covid because of where you work or where you live like healthcare workers teachers first responders grocery store clerks if you fall under these categories you re eligible for the booster now know it doesn look like it but am over wish way over and that why getting my booster shot today the booster line is if you re fully vaccinated the bottom line is that if you re fully vaccinated and you re highly protected now from severe illness even if you get covid you re safe and we re going to do everything we can to keep it that way with the boosters but let me be clear boosters are important but the most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated the vast majority of americans are doing the right thing over of adults have gotten at least one shot about haven gotten any shots and that distinct minority is causing an awful lot of us an awful lot of damage for the rest of the country this is pandemic of the unvaccinated that why moving forward with vaccination requirements wherever can on wednesday ll be traveling to chicago to talk about why it so important that more businesses are instituting their own vaccine requirements we know that to beat this pandemic and to save lives to keep our children safe our schools open our economy going we need to get folks vaccinated so please please do the right thing please get the shots and it could save your life it could save the lives of those around you and it easy accessible and it free so text your zip code to that or visit vaccines gov to find vaccination location near you we can do this get vaccinated thank you very much now going to get my booster shot right here and the major is going to give me the shot no haven had any side effects the first or the second shot thank goodness inaudible take one now but we ll see is that high enough for you she going to get one think she teaching but she going to get one yes we are helping we re doing more than every other nation in the world combined we re going to have well over billion million shots and we re going to continue going we re going to do our part we ve also given great deal of funding to covax which is vehicle that does this so we have plenty plenty of opportunities to make sure we get everyone in the world to play our part the largest partner in the world that getting everyone vaccinated well think look think we get the vast majority like is going on in some industries and some schools think we re awful close but not the scientist think one thing for certain quarter of the country can go unvaccinated and us not continue to have problem any crosstalk reconciliation deal today mr president how close do you think you are you know me born optimist think things are going to go well think we re going to get it done but have meetings tonight tomorrow and for the next little bit victory what at stake well it may not be by the end of the week hope it by the end of the week but as long as we re still alive and long we got three things to do the debt ceiling continue resolution and the two pieces of legislation we do that the country going to be in great shape thank you crosstalk of course millions of americans got the moderna and johnson and johnson vaccines my message for you is this you still have high degree of protection our doctors and scientists are working day and night to analyze the data from those two organizations on whether and when you need booster shot and we ll provide updates for you as the process moves ahead again the bottom line is if you re fully vaccinated you re highly protected from severe illness even if you get covid in fact recent data indicates there only one confirmed positive case per fully vaccinated americans per day you re as safe as possible you re in good shape and we re doing everything we can to keep it that way which is where the booster comes in so let me be clear yes we ve made incredible progress in vaccinating americans with over million people being fully vaccinated as of today but this is pandemic of the unvaccinated and it caused by the fact that despite americans having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in locations we still have over million americans who have failed to get single shot and to make matters worse there are elected officials actively working to undermine with false information the fight against covid this is totally unacceptable the vast majority of americans are doing the right thing three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot but one quarter has not gotten any and in country as large as ours that minority can cause an awful lot of damage and they are causing lot of damage the unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals over running emergency rooms and intensive care units leaving no room for someone with heart attack or cancer operation needed to get the saving care because the places where they would get that care are crowded they are not available the unvaccinated also put our economy recovery at risk causing unease in the economy and causing our needs around the kitchen table can imagine what going on in the conversations this morning and lot of parents wondering what going to happen what going to happen those who have been vaccinated what going to happen potentially slowing economic growth costing jobs the refusal has cost all of us the refusal to get vaccinated has cost all of us and moving forward with vaccination requirements wherever can these requirements will cover two thirds of all workers in america and pleased to see more businesses and organizations instituting their own vaccination requirements ve had business leaders call me and thank me for setting the policies to allow them to do the same thing they are able to do it anyway but it gives them the ability to move forward we re making progress for example united airlines which required vaccines about seven weeks ago now has of their employees vaccinated just four weeks ago the department of defense required vaccinations for the military and already of our active duty service members are vaccinated and we re on track to administer million shots in arms in september so please do the right thing do the right thing and understand there lot of misinformation you ve been fed out there but try to look through it get to people you trust the people who ve been vaccinated ask them ask them so get vaccinated but don just take it from me listen to the voices of the unvaccinated americans who are lying in hospital beds taking their final breath saying and literally we ve seen this on television if only gotten vaccinated if only if only they re leaving behind husbands and wives small children people who adore them people are dying and will die who don have to die it is not hyperbole to suggest it literally tragedy please don let this become your tragedy get vaccinated it can save your life it can save the lives of those around you you know text your zip code to or visit vaccines gov to find vaccination location near you now let me close with this we also made so much progress during the past eight months in this pandemic and now we face critical moment we have the tools we have the plan we just have to finish the job together as one nation and know we can know we can god bless you all and please look out for your own self interest and health here get vaccinated may god protect our troops thank you of course take responsibility president but it was horrible what you saw to see people treated like they did horses nearly running them over and people being strapped it outrageous promise you those people will pay they will be an investigation underway now and there will be consequences there will be consequences it an embarrassment but it beyond an embarrassment it dangerous it wrong it sends the wrong message around the world it sends the wrong message at home it simply not who we are thank you remember said it going to take me year to deliver everything looking at here that number one number two take look at what inherited when came into office when came into office the state of affairs and where we were we had million people vaccinated we had no plan mean could go down the list so part of it is dealing with the panoply of things that were landed on my plate not complaining it just reality it reality number one number two think that part of what has to happen here as well for example let talk about my economic plan the economic plan you all are always and understandably legitimately citing polls every element of my economic plan is overwhelmingly popular overwhelmingly popular but the problem is with everything happening not everybody knows what in that plan for example all those women out there who are not able to go back to work because they have dependent grandparent or parent or they have dependent child who needs help or they can find daycare or they can find mean look at what happening well there solution there solution in the proposal that put forward and the plans we re now debating among ourselves and they re grading in congress is the essence of the plan that laid out in the beginning and so confident that at the end of the day we re going to be able to get that done the second point like to make we talk about price tags it is zero price tag on the debt we re paying we re going to pay for everything we spend so they say it not people understandably well you know it started off at trillion now it trillion now it going to be it going to be zero zero because in that plan that put forward and said from the outset said running to change the dynamic of how the economy grows tired of trickle down the trillionaires and billionaires are doing very very well you all know you ve all reported it and in the middle of this crisis but hardworking people and middle class people are getting hurt and so provide for for example tax cut if you have child you get refundable tax credit it reduced hunger in america by literally for children you have the whole notion of being able to provide for daycare for your children getting people back to school et cetera it all paid for it all paid for but lot of these are flat tax cuts that exist within my proposal and they re being calculated as if the cost of the childcare tax credit is cost to the government it not it reducing taxes reducing taxes not increasing taxes now part of the problem is had hoped hadn planned on although kind of anticipated might happen hadn planned on the mile top winds hurricanes going to louisiana and inches of rain in new york and new jersey and and an area as big as the state of new jersey burning down in the west and so what had hoped would be doing but do what did in the campaign be out making the case about what my plan contained and it been very much curtailed by whole range of things and so think that it understandable think it understandable people being frustrated think they re frustrated as well by the fact that not just members of congress democrats and republicans frustrated by thought this was going to be better thought everything was working out we were moving along on covid and now we have all these people who refuse to get shot and now look at the people dying large numbers of people dying so guess think it totally legit obviously it legitimate question you ve asked but think putting it in context here it going to take some time here and know always kid you when you all ask me about well what about are you going to get done done done well say you want to negotiate being bit facetious obviously but here the deal this is going to end up believe we re going to end up getting both the pieces of my economic legislation the first piece the fundamentally change the structure and the nature of the economy in this country even though remember it got clobbered it was this all this terrible thing no republican voted for it well we got real economic growth now we re at this stalemate at the moment and we re going to have to get these two pieces of legislation passed both need to be passed and they ll have profound impact according to not joe biden but according to wall street according to the imf according to international organizations and then there you know going to be having meeting today with the quad with the leader of india japan and australia and we re going to be talking about afghanistan which is legitimate thing for people to talk about but the truth of the matter is the end of the day is we were spending million day for years there is no easy way to end that and we re now still getting people out but it really there is no picture book way to say okay the war is ended let get everybody out and we ll go home no war ever ended that way other than there been surrender and it totally different circumstance so anyway there lot sure along the line that there are things could have done better but make no apologies for my proposals how proceeding and why think by the end of the year we re going to be in very different place well think what going to happen is you re going to see that in the near term where we re probably going to open this up anyway there constant we re looking at both moderna and and and we re both as said in the speech in addition to that we re also looking to the time when we re going to be able to expand the booster shots basically across the board so would just say it be better to wait your turn in line wait in line wait your turn and to get there yes do look support lot of these proposals we don need all the things support to pay for this but do support that look if you file form the irs has access to your bank account and your bank tells you how much you made what you have in there and they estimate your tax well if you have no earned income and it all investment income it hard to figure out what the hell excuse me what the heck you have and that why we have to and know some people don like this that why we have to rehire some irs agents and not to do anything not to try to make people pay something they don owe just say hey step up step up and pay like everybody else does look really mean this and if you look at at my whole career and come from the corporate state of america just think it about just paying your fair share for lord sake now we can argue whether or not the corporate tax should go back up to or or but the idea that major corporations in america making sum total of billion pays zero come on come on it just wrong it just not fair and think it beginning to sink through the ether little bit here on the part of people so think there clearly is enough from panoply of options to pay for what ever it is that folks decide to pay for and let me finish by answering the initial part of your question if may the way look at it is what ve been telling my colleagues and it surprises them sometimes when we re in those rooms and don know whether you heard but both meetings went very well mean they were collegial there wasn no one hollering everybody you know and people were hanging out afterwards in the oval and anyway both the progressive as well as the moderates and one of the things that think is important and trying to get people to focus on is what is it you like what do you think we forget number what do you think we should be doing is it appropriate in your view to cut taxes for working class people by providing for daycare providing for early education three and four years old is it appropriate to do something about free community college or do you want to means test it and telling them what are your priorities and some of them when they go through their priorities it adds up to number higher than they said they were for because think this is we re getting down to the hard spot here people are having now to go in and look in detail as to what it is specifically they re for it little bit like when we went through and ll end with this there little bit like when we went through the issue of the bipartisan deal on infrastructure there were lot of negotiations on that and it wasn until people were forced to look at what are you for are you for taking care of that highway or bridge in your state or your region are you for doing something about environmental degradation are you for something that deals with allowing us to provide for monies to states so that they can in fact deal with things like what happened in states where the major utility lines come down what do you do to build those back better to prevent that from happening and and as sort of and you all speak to all these folks so you speak to as many as do find that they re going hmm ve never really thought that through before think it makes sense and that how we finally got to bipartisan deal on what is serious infrastructure proposal that really does number of things including things where people said don want to do anything on the environment then they start thinking well wait minute have all these diesel buses at home it would be hell of lot better if we had electric buses that would change the circumstance on boom boom boom so think this is process that what said at the front end that although we got off to very fast start with the first piece of legislation don expect this to be done and us being in position where we can look back and say okay did we get it done until basically the end of the year don mean the vote on the two pieces of legislation relating to the economy but think it just going to take some time and look you know my guess is we all come from similar backgrounds remember you used to sit around the kitchen table in the morning if you had the chance to do that or dinner at night with your mom and dad and your brothers and sisters what did people talk about they talked about are we going to be able to pay the mortgage at least my house mean what going to happen if we have another one of those floods and it blows through here like it did in queens what going to happen what am going to do by the way don just not sure that want my son or daughter to be going into school when so many people are not vaccinated it just not sure want kenny to be there doing this but these practical things people are talking about and they re looking down the road and they re looking at cost of living issues as well and so what the cost of living issues well it because we re in position where the ability to have the product the elements of the production of product that in fact need to go into the production of that product are hard to get ahold of because people are in trouble they re not able to produce them they re not able to get it or they re being hoarded it like what we have with and we re making progress but like what we re doing with regard to making sure we have the computer chips to be able to keep as in the vernacular to keep build automobiles mean think everybody was kind of surprised when think if had said to you may be dead wrong but if had said to you in say april that was going to get all three major manufacturers of american automobiles saying they re going to go electric doubt whether you have thought that could be done well we re out here in the back lawn they ve all of sudden figured it out they ve had bit of an epiphany and they ve realized whoa wait minute man china investing billions of dollars china is getting battery technology we re going to build blah blah blah and this is going to happen anyway and again ll just conclude by saying this is process and it going to be up and down that why don look at the polls not joke because it going to go up and it going to go down it going to go up and hopefully at the end of the day ll be able to deliver on what said would do one bringing the country together on few and very important things like on infrastructure getting us in position where we can have some coherent policy relative for foreign policy where there agreement moving us in position where we re able to actually generate the kind of change in the dynamic of how we grow the economy not eliminate the super wealthy not at all but allow the working class and middle class to be able to build out and up and that can be done and like said every time hear and drive my staff crazy every time hear this is going to cost or the truth is based on the commitment that made it going to cost nothing because we re going to raise the revenue raise the revenue to pay for the things we re talking about and we re going to give and right now if you take look at the reconciliation piece trillion dollars of that is tax cuts not raising anybody taxes it tax cuts people are going to be paying less taxes but the people paying less taxes are going to be working class folks it going to put women back to work it going to put people in situations where they have as know you re tired of hearing me saying but remember my dad constant refrain just give people little breathing room little breathing room thank you guys good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today as said yesterday at the united nations nothing is more urgent than all of us working together to defeat covid and that the world is going to be much better prepared for future pandemics we have to do both this summit is about supercharging efforts in three key areas vaccinating the world by dramatically ramping up vaccine production donations delivery and administering the vaccine which is logistical challenge addressing the oxygen crisis in many hospitals around the world making other treatments more accessible and increasing the availability of public health tools like masks and tests and building back better so that our global health security infrastructure is more resilient than it is today we ve all suffered the united states has lost more than of our fellow americans worldwide the death toll is above million people million people and this global tragedy and we were not going to solve this crisis with half measures or middle of the road ambitions we need to go big and we need to do our part governments the private sector civil society leaders philanthropist this is an all hands on deck crisis and the good news is we know how to beat this pandemic vaccines public health measures and collective action during the first eight months of my presidency we have worked aggressively to get americans and the world vaccinated as president of the united states my first responsibility is to protect the american people and proud that we ve gone from two million america being fully vaccinated when took office in january th to million and counting today in america but we also know that to beat the pandemic care we need to beat it everywhere and made and keeping the promise that america will become the arsenal of vaccines as we re the arsenal for democracy during world war ii we ve already shipped nearly million doses to countries more than every other country has donated combined america donations of half billion pfizer vaccines through covax that ve announced before the summit in june have already begun to ship today announcing another historic commitment the united states is buying another half billion doses of pfizer to donate to low and middle income countries around the world this is another half billion doses that will all be shipped by this time next year and it brings our total commitment of donated vaccines to over billion vaccines to be donated put another way for every one shot we ve administered to date in america we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world want to thank pfizer and its ceo and chairman albert albert been good friend and had been helpful they ve been and continue to be partners in the leader in this fight and the united states is leading the world on vaccination donations as we re doing that we need other high income countries to deliver on their own ambitious vaccine donations and pledges that why today we re launching the eu us vaccine partnership to work more closely together and with our partners in expanding global vaccinations and as we do so we should unite around the world on few principles that we commit to donating not selling donating not selling doses to low and lower income countries and that their donations come with no political strings attached and then we support covax as the main distributor for sharing who approved vaccines and then we fight vaccine this information and exercise transparency to build vital public trust in these saving tools it also important that we are working toward common goals and targets so that we can measure our progress and hold ourselves and each other accountable secretary of state blinken will be convening foreign ministers later this year to check on our collective progress and propose that we come together for second high level virtual summit in the first quarter of to help gauge our progress and keep our efforts fully aligned another goal is dramatically boosting global and regional vaccine manufacturing capacity enhancing transparency so that vaccine production and distribution is as predictable and coordinated in fact an important part of the reason the united states is able to make these big historic donations is because we ve worked with the us vaccine manufacturers to accelerate manufacturing rate and production and now we re working quickly to scale up vaccine manufacturing in other countries around the world so they can manufacture as well we re working with partner nations pharmaceutical companies and other manufacturers to increase their own capacity and capability to produce and manufacture safe and highly effective vaccines in their own countries for example our quad partnership with india japan and australia is on track to help produce at least billion vaccine doses in india to boost the global supply by the end of and we re providing financing and helping you strengthen manufacturing in south africa and produce more than million doses of in africa for africa next year next we also know from experience that getting those vaccines in the people arms may be the hardest logistical challenge we ve faced that why we need to significantly step up our investment in helping countries get shots in arms today the united states is also announcing that we re providing an additional million to support administering these shots and delivery globally and we will be providing more than million to assist in the global vaccine alliance gavi to further facilitate vaccine distribution and regions with the greatest need and while vaccinating the world is the ultimate solution to covid we know that we have to act to save lives now that why the united states have provided nearly billion to reduce covid deaths and mitigate transmission through bulk oxygen support expanded testing and strengthening healthcare systems and more and we re going to help all of us build back better by supporting the establishment of financial mechanism for global health security to simply state it to prepare for the next pandemic because there will be next time we all know that vice president harris will be speaking more on this issue later today and finally want to acknowledge the leaders from the private sector philanthropy and civil society who are here today governments can do lot but we can not do everything on our own we ve asked our non governmental partners to take up the call for new actions that it will solve the core challenge to making vaccines available to everyone everywhere solving the oxygen availability crisis financing health security and more and grateful grateful for their leadership and let me close with what made clear yesterday at the un we can do this this is within our capacity we know what needs to be done we just have to make the choice to do it now the leaders on the screen that see here today know they ve made that choice and think they know we can do this and promise you the united states will continue to lead we ll continue to drive historic commitments in vaccine donations billion and counting so we can defeat covid together and we ll continue to invest in creating future of true global health security for all people that is big big goal we have we should have we re going to lead with the power of our example and we re not going to stop but the only way to get this done is for everyone everywhere is for all of us to step up which confident you will and now like to turn this over to ambassador thomas greenfield united nations and want to thank everybody on the screen can see here without going to each one of you for all you ve done continue to do think you all know we can do this we can do this we have to do this so thank you thank you all mr president mr secretary general my fellow delegates to all those who dedicate themselves to this noble mission of this institution it my honor to speak to you for the first time as president of the united states we meet this year in moment of intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility we ve lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world and impact so much on our existence we re mourning more than million people people of every nation from every background each death is an individual heartbreak but our shared grief is poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity and to act together ladies and gentlemen this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at the dawning of what must be decisive decade for our world decade that will quite literally determine our futures as global community we re challenged by urgent and looming crises and where in lie enormous opportunities if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities will we work together to save lives defeat covid everywhere and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic for there will be another one or will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal as more virulent dangerous variants take hold will we meet the threat of the challenging climate we re all feeling already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather or will we suffer the merciless march of ever worsening droughts and floods more intense fires and hurricanes longer heat waves and rising seas will we affirm and uphold the human dignity and human rights under which nations in common cause more than seven decades ago formed this institution will we apply and strengthen the core tenants of the international system including the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights as we seek to shape the emergence of new technologies and deter new threats or will we allow those universal principles to be trampled and twisted in the pursuit of naked political power in my view how we answer these questions in this moment whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations yet to come simply put we stand in my view at an inflection point in history and here today to share with you how the united states intends to work with partners and allies to answer these questions and the commitment of my new administration helped lead the world toward more peaceful prosperous future for all people instead of continuing to fight the wars of the past we are fixing our eyes on devoting our resources of the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future ending this pandemic addressing the climate crisis managing the shifts in global power dynamics shaping the rules of the world on vital issues like trade cyber and emerging technologies and facing the threat of terrorism as it stands today we ve ended years of conflict in afghanistan and as we close this period of relentless war we re opening new era of relentless diplomacy of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world of renewing and defending democracy proving that no matter how challenging or how complex the problems we re going to face government by and for the people is still the best way to deliver for all of our people and as the united states turns our focus to the priorities and the regions of the world like the indo pacific that are most consequential today and tomorrow we ll do so with our allies and partners through cooperation and multilateral institutions like the united nations to amplify our collective strength and speed our progress toward dealing with these global challenges it is the fundamental truth of the st century within each of our countries and as global community that our own success is bound up in other succeeding as well to deliver for our own people we must also engage deeply with the rest of the world to ensure that our own future we must work together with other partners our partners toward shared future our security our prosperity and our very freedoms are interconnected in my view as never before and so believe we must work together as never before over the last eight months prioritized rebuilding our alliances revitalizing our partnerships and recognizing they re essential and central to america enduring security and prosperity we have reaffirmed our sacred nato alliance to article five commitment we re working with our allies toward new strategic concept that will help our alliance better take on the evolving threats of today and tomorrow we renewed our engagement with the european union fundamental partner in tackling the full range of significant issues facing our world today we elevated the quad partnership among australia india japan and the united states to take on challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies we re engaging with regional institutions from inaudible to the african union to the organization of american states to focus on people urgent needs for better health and better economic outcomes we re back at the table in international forums especially the united nations to focus attention and dispar global action on shared challenges we are reengaged at the world health organization and working in close partnership with kovacs to deliver life saving vaccines around the world we rejoin the paris climate agreement and we re running to retake seat in the human rights council next year at the un and as the united states seeks to rally the world action we will lead not just through the example of our power but god willing with the power of our example make no mistake the united states will continue to defend ourselves our allies and our interest against attack including terrorist threats as we prepare to use force if any is necessary but to defend our vital us national interest including against ongoing and imminent threats but the mission must be clear and achievable undertaken with informed consent of the american people and whenever possible in partnership with our allies us military power must be our tool of last resort not our first it should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the world indeed today many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms bombs and bullets cannot through the force of arms bombs and bullets cannot defend against covid or its future variants to fight this pandemic we need collective act of science and political will we need to act now to get shots and arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen tests treatments to save lives around the world and for the future we need to create new mechanism to finance global health security that builds on our existing development assistance and global health threat council that is armed with the tools we need to monitor and identify emerging pandemics so that we can take immediate action already the united states has put more than billion toward the global covid response we ve shipped more than million doses of covid vaccine to other countries this includes million doses from our own supply and the first tranches of the half billion doses of pfizer vaccine we purchased to donate through covax planes carrying vaccines from the united states have already landed in countries bringing people all over the world little dose of hope as one american nurse termed it to me dose of hope direct from the american people and importantly no strings attached and tomorrow at the us hosted global covid summit ll be announcing additional commitments as we seek to advance the fight against covid and hold ourselves accountable around specific targets on three key challenges saving lives now vaccinating the world and building back better this year has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis the extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world and you all know it and feel it represent what the secretary general has rightly called code red for humanity and the scientists and experts are telling us that we re fast approaching point of no return in literal sense to keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to degrees celsius every nation needs to bring their highest possible ambitions to the table when we meet in glasgow for cop and then to have to keep raising our collective ambition over time in april announced the united states ambitious new goal under the paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the united states by to below levels by as we work toward achieving the clean energy economy with net zero emissions by and my administration working closely with our congress to make critical investments in green infrastructure and electric vehicles will help us lock in progress at home toward our climate goals and the best part is making these ambitious investments isn just good climate policy it chance for each of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future it an enormous opportunity to create good paying jobs for workers in each of our countries and to spur long term economic growth that will improve the quality of life for all of our people we also have to support the countries and people that will be hit the hardest and that have the fewest resources to help them adapt in april announced that united states will double our public international financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis and today proud to announce that we ll work with the congress to double that number again including for adaptation efforts this will make the united states leader in public climate finance and with our added support together with increased private capital from other donors we ll be able to meet the goal of mobilizing billion to support climate action in developing nations as we deal with these crises we re also encountering new era an era of new technologies and possibilities that have potential to release and reshape every aspect of human existence and it up to all of us to determine whether these technologies are forced to empower people or to deepen repression as new technologies continue to evolve we ll work together with our democratic partners to ensure that new advances in areas from biotechnology to quantum computing artificial intelligence and more are used to lift people up to solve problems and advance human freedom not to suppress dissent or target minority communities and the united states tends to make profound investment in research and innovation working with countries at all stages of economic development to develop new tools and technologies to help us tackle the challenges of this second quarter of the st century and beyond we re hardening our critical infrastructure against cyber attacks disrupting ransomware networks and working to establish clear rules of the road for all nations as it relates to cyberspace we reserve the right to respond decisively to cyber attacks that threaten our people our allies or our interest we will pursue new rules of global trade and economic growth to strive level of playing field so it not artificially tipped in favor of any one country at the expense of others and every nation has the right and opportunity to compete fairly we will strive to ensure that basic labor rights environmental safeguards and intellectual property are protected and that the benefits of globalization are shared broadly throughout all our societies we ll continue to uphold the long standing rules and norms that have formed the guardrails of international engagement for decades that have been essential to the development of nations around the world bedrock commitments like freedom of navigation adherence to international laws and treaties support for arms control measures to reduce the risk and enhance transparency our approach is firmly around it and fully consistent with the united nation mission and the values we ve agreed to when we drafted this charter these are commitments we all made and that we re all bound to uphold and as we strive to deal with these urgent challenges whether they re long standing or newly emerging we must also deal with one another all of the major powers of the world have duty in my view to carefully manage their relationships so they do not tip from responsible competition to conflict the united states will compete and we will compete vigorously and lead with our values and our strength we ll stand up for our allies and our friends and oppose attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones whether through changes to territory by force economic coercion or technical exploitation or disinformation but we re not seeking say it again we are not seeking new cold war or world divided into rigid blocks the united states is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to share challenges even if we have intense disagreements in even if we have intense disagreement in other areas because we ll all suffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like covid and climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation the united states remains committed for ready to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapon where are working with the to engage iran diplomatically and to seek return to jcpoa we re prepared to return to full compliance if iran does the same similarly we seek serious and sustained diplomacy to pursue the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula we seek concrete progress toward an available plan with tangible commitments that would increase stability on the peninsula and in the region as well as improve the lives of the people in the democratic people republic of korea we must also remain vigilant to the threat of terror that terrorism poses to all our nations whether emanating from distant regions of the world or in our own backyard we know the bitter string of terrorism the bitter sting of terrorism is real we ve almost all experienced it last month we lost american heroes and almost innocent afghan civilians in heinous terrorist attack at kabul airport those who commit acts of terrorism against us will continue to find determined enemy in the united states the world today is not the world of though and the united states is not the same country we were when we were attacked on years ago today we re better equipped to detect to prevent terrorist threats and we are more resilient in our ability to repel them and to respond we know how to build effective partnerships to dismantle terrorist networks by targeting their financing and support systems countering their propaganda preventing their travel as well as disrupting imminent attacks we ll meet terrorist threats that arise today and the future with full range of tools available to us including working in cooperation with local partners so that we need not be so reliant on large scale military deployments one of the most important ways we can effectively enhance security and reduce violence is by seeking to improve the lives of the people all over the world who see that their governments are not serving their needs corruption fuels inequality siphons off nation resources spreads across borders and generates human suffering it nothing less than national security threat in the st century around the world we re increasingly seeing citizens demonstrate their discontent seeing the wealthy and well connected grow richer and richer taking payoffs and bribes operating above the law while the vast majority of the people struggle to find job or put food on the table or to get their businesses off the ground or simply send their children to school people have taken to the streets in every region to demand that their governments address people basic needs give everyone fair shot to succeed and protect their god given rights and in that chorus of voices across languages and continents we hear common cry cry for dignity simple dignity as leaders it our duty to answer that call not to silence it the united states has committed to using our resources and our international platform to support these voices listen to them partner with them to find ways to respond that advance human dignity around the world for example there an enormous need for infrastructure in developing countries with infrastructure that is low quality or that feeds corruption or exacerbates environmental degradation may only end up contributing to greater challenges for countries over time done the right way however with transparent sustainable investment in projects that respond to the country needs and engage their local workers to maintain high labor and environmental standards infrastructure can be strong foundation that allows societies in low and middle income countries to grow and to prosper that the idea behind the build back better world and together with the private sector and our partners we aim to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment we will also continue to be the world largest contributor to humanitarian assistance bringing food water shelter emergency healthcare and other vital life saving aid to millions of people in need when the earthquake strikes the typhoon rages or disaster anywhere in the world the united states shows up we ll be ready to help and at time when nearly one in three people globally do not have access to adequate food adequate food just last year the united states is committing to rallying our partners to address immediate malnutrition and to ensure that we can sustainably feed the world for the decades to come to that end the united states is making billion commitment to end hunger and invest in food systems at home and abroad since the united states government has provided more than billion to advance health and strengthen health systems and we will continue our leadership to drive these vital investments to make people lives better every single day just give them little breathing room and as we strive to make lives better we must work with renewed purpose to end the conflicts that are driving so much pain and hurt around the world we must redouble our diplomacy and commit to political negotiations not violence as tool of first resort to manage tensions around the world we must seek future of greater peace and security for all people of the middle east the commitment of the united states digital securities without question are our support for an independent jewish state is unequivocal but continue to believe that two state solution is the best way to ensure israel future as jewish democratic state living in peace alongside of viable sovereign and democratic palestinian state we re long way from that goal at this moment but we must never allow ourselves to give up on the possibility of progress we cannot give up on solving raging civil conflicts including in ethiopia and yemen who are fighting between warring parties is driving famine horrific violence human rights violations against civilians including an unconscionable use of rape as weapon of war we ll continue to work with the international community to press for peace and bring an end to this suffering as we pursue diplomacy across the board the united states will champion the democratic values that go to the very heart of who we are as nation and people freedom equality opportunity and belief in the universal rights of all people it stamped into our dna as nation and critically it stamped into the dna of this institution the united states we sometimes forget to quote the opening words of the universal declaration of human rights quote the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world the founding ethos of the united nations places the rights of individuals at the center of our system and that clarity and vision must not be ignored or misinterpreted the united states will do our part but we ll be more successful and more impactful if all of our nations are working toward the full mission to which we are called that why more than nations united around shared statement and the security council adopted resolution outlining how we ll support the people of afghanistan moving forward laying out the expectations to which we ll hold the taliban when it comes to respecting universal human rights we all must advocate for the rights of women and girls to use their full talents to contribute economically politically and socially and pursue their dreams free of violence and intimidation from central america to the middle east to africa to afghanistan wherever it appears in the world we all must call out and condemn the targeting and oppression of racial ethnic and religious minorities whether it occurs in xinjiang or northern ethiopia or anywhere in the world we all must defend the rights of lgbtqi individuals so they can live and love openly without fear whether it chechnya or cameroon or anywhere as we steer our nations toward this inflection point and work to meet today fast moving cross cutting challenges let me be clear am not agnostic about the future we want for the world the future will belong to those who embrace human dignity not trample it the future will belong to those who unleash the potential of their people not those who stifle it the future will belong to those who give their people the ability to breathe free not those who seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand the authoritarians of the world may seek to proclaim the end of the age of democracy but they re wrong the truth is the democratic world is everywhere it lives in anti corruption activists human rights defenders the journalists the peace protesters on the front lines of this struggle in belarus burma syria cuba venezuela and everywhere in between it lives in the brave women of sudan who withstood violence and oppression to push genocidal dictator from power and who keep working every day to defend their democratic progress it lives in the proud moldovans who helped deliver landslide victory for the forces of democracy with mandate to fight graft to build more inclusive economy it lives in the young people of zambia who harnessed the power of their vote for the first time turning out in record numbers to denounce corruption and chart new path for their country and while no democracy is perfect including the united states we ll continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions and we face down violence and insurrection democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential my fellow leaders this is the moment where we must prove ourselves the equals of those who come before us who with vision and values and determined faith in our collective future built our united nations broke the cycle of war and destruction and laid the foundations for more than seven decades of relative peace and growing global prosperity now we must again come together to affirm the inherent humanity that unites us is much greater than any outward divisions or disagreements we must choose to do more than we think we can do alone so that we accomplish what we must together ending this pandemic and making sure we re better prepared for the next one staving off climactic climate change and increasing our resilience to the impacts we already are seeing ensuring future where technologies are the vital tool to solving human challenges and empowering human potential not source of greater strife and repression these are the challenges that will determine what the world looks like for our children and our grandchildren and what they ll inherit we can only meet them by looking to the future stand here today for the first time in years the united states is not at war we ve turned the page all the unmatched strength energy and commitment will and resources of our nation are now fully and squarely focused on what ahead of us not what was behind know this as we look ahead we will lead we will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time from covid to climate peace and security human dignity and human rights but we will not go it alone we will lead together with our allies and partners in cooperation with all those who believe as we do that this is within our power to meet these challenges to build future that lifts all of our people and preserves this planet but none of this is inevitable it choice and can tell you where america stands we will choose to build better future we you and we have the will and capacity to make it better ladies and gentlemen we cannot afford to waste any more time let get to work let make our better future now we can do this it within our power and capacity thank you god bless you all the climate crisis also presents real and incredible economic opportunities to create jobs and lift up the standard of living for people around the world and want to thank you and your efforts so far and need to tell you the consequences of inaction but you all actually know it it somewhat presumptuous of me to say this but over the last two weeks ve traveled across the united states to see the damage and destruction from record hurricanes record floods and wildfires china continues across excuse me climate continues to change across europe africa and latin america and you ve endured massive flooding fires have raged across australia and the amazon and the russian tundra in siberia found it almost unbelievable temperatures reached degrees degrees inside the arctic circle the finding from new intergovernmental panel on climate change represents code red for humanity and the time to act is really narrowing as the secretary just pointed out if we get too close to point of no return we don have lot of time so we have to act all of us we have to act and we have to act now when we met in april we agreed to strengthen our efforts as we had cop in glasgow today ve called us together again to candidly assess our progress grateful to those of you who ve strengthened your contributions under the paris climate agreement and put forward ambitious targets for and thanks to your leadership countries representing more than half of the global gdp are committed to taking steps that will keep us within reach of our joint pursuit of limiting warming to degrees celsius but we know there still lot of work to do and if anything our job is my view has grown more urgent the countries representing the major economies forum account for of global emissions without adequate commitments from every nation in this room the goal of limiting warming to degrees slips through our hands and that disaster here what believe we have to do right now and what we re advancing here in the united states we have to bring to glasgow our highest possible ambitions those that have not yet done so time is running out for our part in america working to pass historic investment and to modernize our climate resilient infrastructure to build clean energy future that creates millions of jobs and ushers in new industries in the future as part of this work the united states is committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions between and below levels by the year and we set goal that by our power sector will be free of carbon and of the cars sold in the united states we believe should be must be electrical vehicles further step we re working with the european union and other partners to launch is global methane pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least below levels by this will not only rapidly reduce the rate of global warming but it will also produce very valuable side benefit like improving public health and agricultural output we re mobilizing support to help developing countries join and pledge to do something significant pledge and seize this virtual opportunity we ve already taken big steps domestically to tackle these emissions and create good paying jobs introduced by plugging leaks and capping abandoned wells and gas wells we believe the collective goal is both ambitious but realistic and we urge you to join us in announcing this pledge at cop now we also have to make additional progress to support developing countries at the leaders summit in april announced the united states is working to double our climate finance triple our support for adaptation by for developing nations and can assure you that we re looking for ways to go even further toward meeting the collective goal of mobilizing hundred billion dollars year from the developing world and for them our emphasis this year is going to be on building ambition on the road to glasgow glasgow is not our final destination whatever commitments we make at cop we must all resolve together in glasgow to continue strengthening our ambition and our actions next year and throughout the decisive decade to keep us below degrees keep that within reach that why this forum believe is so important and it was an important driver in the paris climate agreement we got to continue to play vital role going forward at this critical juncture the start of decisive decade can use this forum to forge political momentum and consensus to drive concrete actions in four key spheres of energy industry land the ocean and want to be clear this forum will compliment not substitute for other forums in fact with respect to energy and industry we will closely align our efforts with the work of the forums like the clean energy ministerial and the mission innovation both of which proud to say the united states will chair next year plan to kick off these efforts by bringing together ministers in january to discuss clean energy goals in power transport industry building sector we also want to focus on ocean initiatives in advance of our ocean conference next february plan to convene leaders level gathering so we can take stock of the collective progress we ve made in closing and thank you for your patience want to again underscore both the urgency of this moment and the tremendous opportunity before us look forward to continuing this work together and hearing how you plan to contribute to the climate ambition the world so urgently needs the time is now the time is now thank you for your indulgence now going to turn this over to special envoy john kerry thank you just look at the facts ceos used to make about times the average worker in the company that they ran today they make more than times what the average worker in their corporation makes since the pandemic began billionaires have seen their wealth go up by trillion that is everyone who was billionaire before the pandemic began the total accumulated wealth beyond the billions they already had has gone up by trillion simply not fair and how is it possible that of the largest corporations in this country paid in federal income taxes they made over billion in the year and they paid zero think about that in federal taxes on billion in profits how is it possible that the wealthiest billionaires in the country can entirely escape paying income tax on what they ve made how is it possible for millionaires and billionaires that can pay lower rate of tax than teachers firefighters or law enforcement officers here the simple truth for long time this economies were great for those at the very top ordinary hardworking americans the people who built this country had been basically cut out of the deal and ve said this from the time announced was going to run believe this is moment potentially great change this is our moment to deal working people back into the economy this is our moment to prove the american people that their government works for them not just for the big corporations and those at the very top when was sworn in as president the nation was struggling to pull out of the worst economic crisis since the great depression job growth was anemic with just over new jobs per month in the three months before was sworn in then we went to work and passed the american rescue plan back in march and it worked and still working over the last three months we ve been creating on average new jobs per month our economy is growing at the fastest rate we ve seen in nearly years our recovery is unique in the world we re the only developed country in the world whose economy is now bigger than it was before the pandemic while this is all good news know many americans are still struggling to make it through each and every day for too many it harder and harder to pay the bills food gas rent healthcare get it we still have long way to go to get the economy where it needs to be as ve said for long time coming out of this economic crisis as deep as the one we re in was never going to be easy but we re doing it and we can continue to do it covid supply chain issues bad actors seeking to profit off the pandemic are all contributing to the challenges we re facing that why ve made getting covid under control my top priority from my first day as president everything everything from our public health or our economy depends on this we ve made enormous progress against the virus through the summer and now we put ourselves in strong position to battle this delta variant that why the actions proposed on vaccines last week are so critical from requiring federal workers to get vaccinated requiring healthcare workers to be vaccinated requiring employers with over employees to institute vaccine and or test protocols calling on for them to be able to know what their employees are doing before they walk through the door calling for vaccine or test requirements to enter big venues and whole series of steps posed to protect our kids in schools wall street firms have analyzed the impact of these plans and they re projecting that these new requirements will help million more americans get vaccinated which will help more businesses stay open and more americans back to work the data shows that overwhelming majority of americans agree with my proposal there no surprise given that of american adults have already gotten at least one shot but we re facing lot of pushback especially from some of the republican governors the governors of florida and texas are doing everything they can to undermine the life saving requirements that proposed and some of the same governors attacking me are in states with the strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the entire country for example in mississippi children are required to be vaccinated against measles mumps rubella chicken pox hepatitis polio tetanus and more these are state requirements but in the midst of pandemic that has already taken over lives proposed requirement for covid vaccines and the governor of that state calls it quote tyrannical type move tyrannical type move this is the worst kind of politics because it putting the lives of citizens of their states especially children at risk and refuse to give into it these policies are what the science tells us we need to do they re going to save lives they ll protect our economic recovery as well and allow the economy to continue to grow we re also going after the bad actors and pandemic profiteers in our economy there lots of evidence that gas prices should be going down but they haven we re taking close look at that taxpayers in this country also have paid for extraordinary effort to keep our country going over the past year or so unlike the last administration which resisted oversight and allowed tax payers to be victimized by fraud we re working hard to protect vulnerable americans from having their identity stolen as consequence their unemployment checks stolen as well and we re going to go after organized criminals that defraud america or misused covid funds look we re also taking closer look at places in our economy where fewer and fewer corporate giants are controlling more and more of the marketplace in the area they work just look at agriculture and the food industry very small number of giant corporations now dominate the market which gives them the ability to drive up prices because they face so little competition as we work to build healthier competition in our economy and crack down on bad actors the american rescue plan which we passed in march is still working to give hardworking americans hardworking people some relief one of the best examples of that relief is the expansion of the child tax credit which in effect is essentially historic tax cut for families with children just yesterday million working moms and dads got their direct payment that money going to help cover groceries the mortgage new pairs of shoes all the things that kids need it tax cut for working families so we re working to provide as much relief as we can right now to american families but here the truth yes the pandemic has caused lot of economic problems in the country but the fact is our economy faced challenges long before this pandemic struck working people were struggling to make it long before the pandemic arrived big corporations and the very wealthy were doing very well before the pandemic that why ve said starting back in my campaign for president that it not enough to just build back we have to build back better than before and that how it all begins big corporations and super wealthy have to start paying their fair share of taxes it long overdue not out to punish anyone capitalist if you can make million or billion dollars that great god bless you all asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn happening now today in this country right now the top for example evade an estimated billion in taxes that they owe each year not new taxes taxes that they owe the way it works is this if you re typical american like suspect most of the press people sitting in front of me here you pay your taxes why because you get form it comes in the mail every year the irs gets that information as well your taxes get deducted from your paycheck and you pay what is owed beyond that that why of working people pay the taxes they owe but that not how it works for people with tens of millions of dollars they play by different set of rules and they re often not employees themselves so the irs can see what they make and can tell if they re cheating that how many the top get away with paying virtually nothing it estimated by serious economists that that number is about billion collectively owed each year that doesn get paid it not an even playing field my plan would help solve that for example it would give the irs the resources it needs to keep up with the lawyers and accountants of the super wealthy it would ask just for two pieces of information from the banks of these folks the amounts that come into their bank accounts and what amounts go out of their bank accounts so that the wealthy can no longer hide what they re making and they can finally begin to pay their fair share what they owe that isn about raising their taxes it about the super wealthy finally beginning to pay what they owe what the existing tax code calls for just like hardworking americans do all over this country every tax day look and like said just few minutes ago most profitable corporations in america paid zero in federal income taxes on what amounted to billion in profit not penny that not right my economic plan will change that not punish anybody just make them pay their fair share but my republican friends in congress don want to change the law so what are they doing they re attacking me and my plan which is fine but if you re going to have debate let have an honest debate my republican friends are attacking my plan saying it big spending let me remind you these are the same folks who just four years ago passed the trump tax cut totaling almost trillion in tax cuts giant giveaway to the largest corporations in the top and listen to this almost none of that trillion tax cut was paid for it just ballooned the federal deficit in fact the unpaid bills racked up by the last administration are projected to increase the national debt by more than trillion over time what proposing is totally different from that approach for three reasons first my plan is paid for it fiscally responsible because our investments are paid for by making sure the corporations and wealthy americans pay their fair share second we re not going to raise tax on anyone making under that lot of money some of my liberal friends are saying it should be lower than that but only corporations and people making over year are going to pay additional tax and third not only will no one making under see their taxes go up the middle class are going to get some tax cuts some breaks my plan benefits ordinary americans not those at the top who don need the help it historic middle class tax cut cutting taxes for over million families my republican friends are making different choice though they rather protect the tax breaks of those at the very top than give tax breaks to working families it that simple but let me ask you this where is it written all the tax breaks in the american tax code go to corporations in the very top think it enough tired of it for me it pretty simple it about time working people got the tax breaks in this country that what my plan does and here what it also does by asking big corporations and very wealthy to pay their fair share it makes it possible to invest in america to invest in the american people according to leading economist forecasters like moody and major international financial institutions my plan will create jobs make us more competitive and grow our economy and lessen not increase inflationary pressure don know what been handed out today but by the way nobel laureates in economics released letter yesterday arguing that exact same point they said and quote and this is from nobel laureates in economics quote because this agenda the one talking about mine because this agenda invests in long term economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more americans to participate productively in the economy it will ease long term inflationary pressures it will ease it let me highlight just few provisions in my plan know this is long and apologize but it important think my plan lowers the cost of daycare and childcare and elder care for families and the added benefit of millions of people mostly women who are not able to go back to work because of very young family members or elderly people they re taken care of allow them to go back to work it estimated in the millions can go back it lowers healthcare premiums for millions of families it lowers prescription drug costs by giving medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices and it strengthens medicare by adding dental vision and hearing coverage if you re on medicare it also extends tax cut for families of kids that we passed in the american rescue plan in march all of this will mean thousands of dollars in savings for the average american family on some of the toughest and most important bills they have to pay every month my republican friends talk lot about inflation but if you want to talk about actually lowering the cost of living for people in this country my plan does just that by strengthening the capacity of our economy will also reduce inflationary pressures over the long run here something else my plan does it confronts the crisis of extreme weather events that we re seeing all around us and around the world but just here in america we see it everywhere we know it real in just the past few weeks and there more to come ve seen the destruction of hurricanes in louisiana where winds got up to gusts miles an hour deadly toll from flooding new york where inches of rain in new jersey more than inches of rain in some areas more than million acres of our lands and communities have burned to the ground in wildfires just this year alone that more than the size of the entire state of new jersey burned to the ground when was out in california flew over some of these areas in addition there severe drought in the west and the midwest there blinking code red out there for the nation we can wait to act extreme weather just last year cost the american public billion in damage billion in damage last year and unfortunately we re likely to break that record this year and the evidence is overwhelming that every dollar we invest in resilience saves down the road when the next fire doesn spread as widely or the power station holds up against storm we need to rebuild with resilience with resilience in mind so roads are built higher levies are built made more stronger transmission lines are better protected and so much more hope we re past debating climate change in this country now we have to act and we have to act fast and my plan does that let me end with this this pandemic has been god awful for so many reasons the lost lives said over the jobs the businesses lost the lost time in school for our kids but it does present us with an opportunity we can build an economy that gives working people fair shot this time we can restore some sanity and fairness to our tax code we can make the investments that we know are long overdue in this nation that exactly what my bipartisan infrastructure plan does should say our bipartisan infrastructure plan does investments in roads bridges highways clean water in every home in every school universal broadband quality affordable places for families to live and we can invest in our people giving our families little help with their toughest expenses like daycare childcare elder care prescription drugs healthcare preparing young people to compete against any country in the world with preschool and community college we can confront this crisis of extreme weather and climate change and not only protect our communities but create new opportunities new industries and new jobs in short this is an opportunity to be the nation we know we can be nation where all of us all of us not just those are the top are getting to share the benefits of growing economy in years ahead let not squander this moment trying to preserve an economy that hasn worked too well for americans for long time let not look backward just trying to rebuild what we had let look forward together as one america not to build back but to build back better thank you all very much and god bless you all may god protect our troops thank you honored today to be joined by two of america closest allies australia and the united kingdom to launch new phase of the trilateral security cooperation among our country as prime minister morrison and prime minister johnson said want to thank you for this partnership your vision as we embark together on this strategic mission although australia the uk and us partnership aukus it sounds strange and all these acronyms but it good one aukus our nations will update and enhance our shared ability to take on the threats of the st century just as we did in the th century together our nations and our brave fighting forces have stood shoulder to shoulder for literally more than years through the trench fighting in world war the island hopping in world war ii during the frigid winners in korea and the scorching heat of the persian gulf the united states australia and the united kingdom have long been faithful and capable partners and we re even closer today today we re taking another historic step to deepen and formalize cooperation among all three of our nations because we all recognize the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the indo pacific over the long term we need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region and how it may evolve because the future of each of our nations and indeed the world depends on free and open indo pacific enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead this is about investing in our greatest source of strength our alliances and updating them to better meet the threats of today and tomorrow it about connecting america existing allies and partners in new ways and amplifying our ability to collaborate recognizing there is no regional divide separating the interests of our atlantic and pacific partners indeed this effort reflects the broader trend of key european countries playing an extremely important role in the indo pacific france in particular already has substantial indo pacific presence and is key partner and ally in strengthening the security and prosperity of the region the united states looks forward to working closely with france and other key countries as we go forward and finally this initiative is about making sure that each of us has modern capability the most modern capabilities we need to maneuver and defend against rapidly evolving threats aukus will bring together our sailors our scientists and our industries to maintain and expand our edge in military capabilities and critical technologies such as cyber artificial intelligence quantum technologies and undersea domains as key project under aukus we are launching consultations with australia acquisition of conventionally armed nuclear powered submarines for its navy conventionally armed want to be exceedingly clear about this we re not talking about nuclear armed submarines these are conventionally armed submarines that are powered by nuclear reactors this technology is proven it safe and the united states and the uk have been operating nuclear powered submarines for decades have asked secretary austin of the department of defense to lead this effort for the us government in close collaboration with the department of energy and the department of state our governments will now launch an month consultation period to determine every element of this program from workforce to training requirements to production timelines to safeguards and non proliferation measures and to nuclear stewardship and safety to ensure full compliance with each of our nation commitments under the nuclear non proliferation treaty we ll all undertake this effort in way that reflects the longstanding leadership in global non proliferation and rigorous verification standards in partnership and consultation with the international atomic energy agency so want to thank the prime minister prime minister morrison and prime minister johnson for their friendship but mostly important for their leadership and partnership as we undertake this new phase of our security cooperation and the united states will also continue to work with asean and the quad as was stated earlier our five treaty allies and other close partners in the indo pacific as well as allies and partners in europe and around the world to maintain free and open indo pacific and build future of peace opportunity for all the people of the region we re joining together our partnerships are getting stronger this is what we re about want to thank you all and look

washington today right now and so there lot in senator bennett and hickenlooper and congressman inaudible they re all in washington doing what they have to do when you look at who you ve heard from it clear whether you re an engineer or at lab bench or an ibw worker working on turbine when you work for power company or small construction business everyone has role to play and everyone is building clean energy future and stronger economy because that what it about and we need everyone contributions we need everyone contributions yesterday saw firsthand the devastation of the caldor fire in california we flew over it in the helicopter and the last two weeks traveled louisiana new york and new jersey see the destruction from hurricane ida more people killed in new york with flooding inches of rain and what happened up there than were killed when mile an hour winds hit louisiana extreme weather as we re seeing is only going to come more frequently and with more ferocity and we re blinking code red as nation we really are so far this year nationwide there were wildfires that have burned nearly million acres that the size of the entire state of new jersey burned flat they ve caused billions of dollars in damage and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes and businesses and even if it not in your backyard you feel the effects as you mentioned earlier you turn on the local weather in addition to the tide and what the temperature is and what the precipitation would be you want to know what the smoke forecast is going to be when parents fear letting their kid out to play outside it may trigger an asthma attack you saw the vicious cycle this summer when heavy rains combined with the burn scar of grizzly creek fire it resulted in mudslides as it was pointed out that washed out an entire section of interstate adding hours of people drives and cutting off vital commercial artery the bottom line is it everywhere it everywhere communities that nearly one in three americans call home have been struck by weather disasters in just the past few months hurricanes in the gulf coast and up the eastern seaboard wildfires threatening throughout the west and tearing it apart droughts and heat waves across the country devastating farmers and ranchers and draining the colorado river in addition to the loss lives live shattered extreme weather cost america last year billion billion extreme weather costs last year and it going to break the record this year it going to be well over billion we know what the driver is climate change we know what causing climate change human activity this is no longer subject to debate and might add windmills do not cause cancer look we got to get real about what going on really mean think about it the only debate is around what we do to confront this crisis and that shouldn even be debate we have to invest in being more resilient because of the impacts of climate the climate change is current today not next year not years from now and we have to make investments that are going to slow our contributions to climate change today not tomorrow and here the good news something that is caused by humans can be solved by humans ve set course for the united states to achieve to reduction in greenhouse emissions by and for us to reach that net zero emissions in the economy economy wide across the board by as part of that set goal of having our country produce carbon pollution free power by we can do that we can do all of this in way that creates good jobs lowers cost to consumers and businesses it makes us global leaders in an entirely new industry that other countries are really working hard to try to dominate just toured the renewable energy lab which hadn been here not the same lab but haven been here since which was started under president carter and expanded under president hw bush leaders of both parties have recognized that clean energy future is an economic imperative and national security imperative and an environmental imperative that why my build back better plan calls for significant new investments and upgrading research infrastructures laboratories all across the country we ll be making one of those breakthroughs in solar wind and storage out of these facilities out innovate the rest of the world drive down the cost of renewable energy of course we have to invest in the future we need to deploy cutting edge technologies and we have to employ them today not tomorrow had chance to see the state of your wind turbine testing and new battery technologies because of the years of work that have taken place here and these technologies aren science fiction they re ready to be installed and scaled up across the country right now by union members like the ones we heard from the day and that what we re going to do as we just heard from the ceo of excel energy they set goal of producing carbon emission free power they re the first major utility to set that goal and today over large facilities around the nation have set similar goal you led the way today one of every three americans those are the city or state transitioning to clean energy clean energy electricity but folks we have to pick up the pace when rejoined the paris climate accord after we had been pulled out of it the goal set when our last administration the obama biden administration when that was set they were set that we had more time we don have the time now the goals are different because the necessity is there we don have lot of time we didn have much more than years for real and this is decisive decade already the price of solar generation in this country has dropped over the past decade the price of wind turbine generation has dropped lot is because of the investments we made in the recovery act back when was vice president and today renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many parts of the country now we need to take the next step of continuing to drive prices down and job creation up because those renewable goals create demand for more wind turbines and more solar installations which means good jobs for workers like julian and his union brothers and sisters and you can see why think the climate change when think of it think jobs had meeting with over heads of state on zoom and we hosted in out of the white house and one of the things by the time finished everyone was talking about jobs it not about costing jobs initially as you remember even you guys spent lot of time before announced my plan meeting with all of you to convince you all that this is the future these are where the jobs are when say jobs not talking about an hour am not speaking loudly enough can see you having trouble hearing me back there talking about union jobs not bucks an hour bucks an hour benefits that going to grow the country too ve never seen the wealthy do poorly when the middle class does well that never happened so to accelerate that process we need to invest and innovate we need modern electric grid one that is much higher capacity more resilient transmission wires and has more storage capacity using advanced batteries so we can hold on to surplus energy generated when the sun not shining and the wind not blowing right now it going to rain no right now we ve got transmission projects that could carry enough power for millions of homes but they need catalytic investment to move to the construction phase our bipartisan infrastructure bill contains the largest federal investment in power transmission in our history so that our grid is more reliable we can carry more renewable energy so we can create good union jobs building that new grid we re also making dramatic investments in public transit electric buses charging stations in denver we re going to help mayor hancock achieve his goal of reducing greenhouse gases in the city by it going to create jobs we know the local apprentice center is busy training workers to be able to perform and by the way bringing the automakers including the big three and the uaw along so we have more electric vehicles on the road and fewer tailpipe emissions in the air we re going to cap thousands of abandoned oil wells and gas wells leaking methane threatening public health and communities and get paid the same price for capping them as it was the dig them we re going to provide support to make our communities including tribal nations much more resilient to the impacts of climate change every dollar we invest to floodproof power station install power lines underground winterize power plant or to build an advanced turbines like the ones here every dollar we spend save down the road because the next time disaster strikes flooding is contained the fire doesn spread as widely the power stays on and these investments can also save lives save homes and create good paying jobs for americans to make our country stronger and more resilient in fact experts tell us that the bipartisan agreement we ve reached in the american infrastructure bill will put people to work including plumbers pipe fitters electrical workers steel workers modernizing roads bridges water systems broadband systems making high speed internet available to coloradoans who currently don have it that what in the infrastructure bill that already agreed to and we re negotiating right now from my plan to build back better which includes additional action to address climate crisis it includes tax credits that will effectively cut the cost of building utility scale solar farms by shorten the time it takes for residential scale solar systems to pay for themselves in around eight years and instead of eight in less than five years save consumers bucks for electric vehicle like ford by the way zero to in that different help us reach the goal of half of new cars sold in america will be electric by saving billions of gallons of gasoline and want to create civilian climate corp ve been pushing that for long time similar to the conservation corps that president roosevelt created during the great depression put new generation of americans to work helping us connect and conserve our public lands and become resilient in the process yesterday visited the national interagency fire center in idaho where we coordinate our federal fire response to the wildfires they told me that the civilian climate corp would make an enormous difference by cleaning away combustible underbrush that enable fires and spread by planting trees to fight climate change in the end it not about red states or blue states drought or fire doesn see property line it doesn give damn for which party you belong to disasters aren going to stop that the nature of the climate threat but we know what we have to do we just need to summon the courage and the creativity do it yes we face crisis we face crisis with an unprecedented opportunity to create good jobs to teach you to create industries of the future to win the future to save the planet ladies and gentleman we can do this this is the united states of america there has never been problem we faced when we set our mind to deal with that we haven been able to mean it literally never have we failed to meet an objective we set and what happening now with both the industry government unions people around the country is that we set goal and the goal is achievable and promise you promise you it going to create great economic growth reduce inflation and put people in place where those beautiful children in the back are never going to have to worry about what we re worrying about right now so thank you remember there not damn thing we re unable to do in america when come together never ever have we failed and we re not going to fail now because of all of you thank you for everything it good to be back in your town last time out here we were talking about infrastructure now we got lot of money coming this way we ve got lot working we ve got an infrastructure bill that we passed and we re going to do an awful lot more to build this incredible incredible economy someone was saying to me earlier today the most diverse state in the nation matter of fact think it was your senator the most diverse state in the nation the most different state in the nation the biggest state in the nation and has the one of the largest economies in the world and no one sees any inconsistency there it because we re diverse you have the largest economy in the world senator padilla thank you for your leadership in the united states senate you re doing an incredible job and know she was here last week but ve got to give shout out to my favorite daughter of california who always talking about you all talks about you all the time like talk about delaware she loves you matter of fact she thinks you re the only state in the nation vice president kamala harris of course the reason here and you re all over here is to thank and support our friend governor gavin newsom one the best governors in the country california not sure you know it but if you didn know it you showed the eyes of the nation this is not hyperbole the eyes of nation on california because the decision you re about to make isn just going to have huge impact on california it going to reverberate around the nation and quite frankly not joke around the world and here why all of you know the last year got to run against the real donald trump well this year the leading republican running for governor is the closest thing to trump clone that ve ever seen in your state no really mean it he leading the other team he the clone of donald trump can you imagine him being governor of this state you can let that happen there too much at stake and here why it so important for you all to vote no on the recall first voting no will be protecting california from trump republicans trying to block us from beating this pandemic covid gavin newsom has had the courage to lead stand up for science for the very thing he been one of the leading governors in the nation protecting people and vaccinating his state meanwhile we see something else in parts of america right now there are certain republican governors like the governor of mississippi talking to me about being dictatorial about demanding that people get vaccinated or tested people are doing everything they can to block or undermine the life saving mandates we proposed putting their people at risk putting their children at risk putting their states at risk and here the worst thing for these republican governors it isn about public health about the health of the people it about politics look folks just look at the hypocrisy the same governors who are attacking me and your governor for covid mandates are in states with some of the strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the whole country talk about inconsistency in mississippi children are required to be vaccinated against measles mumps rubella chicken pox hepatitis polio tetanus and more it state requirement now in the midst of this pandemic that has taken over lives propose mandate for covid vaccines and it an outrage it an infringement on freedom look folks we don need politics in this battle against covid we need science we need courage we need leadership we need gavin newsom governor who follow science who got the courage to do what right and will lead apologize for coughing last week laid out six part plan for the fall to beat this pandemic first vaccinate the unvaccinated with new vaccine requirements two protect the vaccinated three keep children safe in school and four increase testing and masking and keep our economy going strong and take care of people with covid that what the science tells us we have to beat the delta variant of covid gavin will be governor who will help us finish the job folks send message to the nation courage matters leadership matters science matters vote to keep gavin get vaccinated to save lives second by voting no you ll be keeping governor who respects women instead of someone who wrote that women know less about politics and economics than men he hadn met my wife look if you have any doubt about how important it is to have gavin who respects women rights just take look at what happening to states like texas they just passed the law empowering complete strangers to become bounty hunters going after women who exercise their right to choose law that the united states supreme court refused to stop now other states say they re looking to replicate the texas law if you don think women rights are under assault you re not looking california keep gavin newsom and send message to the nation women are to be respected and their rights protected third by voting no you ll be protecting california from another trump climate denier who said global warming is crock and depicts it as myth look it hard to believe there any climate deniers left in america let me tell you something there are the last place you want someone like that is in the governor office in california all see what happening wild fires burning million acres in california this year alone million acres have burned in the region that bigger than the entire state of new jersey and it big state the governor and were just in sacramento for briefing on the caldor fire last week saw the destruction and the death caused by hurricane ida in new york new jersey and louisiana folks extreme weather is here the climate crisis isn going away it getting worse we have to deal with it not deny it so california you ve got to keep gavin newsom as governor and send message to the nation that we have to deal with the climate crisis now we can wait any longer when got elected president immediately rejoined the paris climate accord just since we put that together in our administration and barack administration just since then everything has collapsed even further we don have much time not joke we re talking about nine to years before we pass the point of no return our children need it the planet needs it look forth by voting no you ll be standing up for governor who protects workers rather than one who believes there shouldn be can believe this guy there shouldn be minimum wage the leading republican candidate thinks the minimum wage should be zero look working people have taken it on the chin too long we need leaders like gavin who ll respect them hear them fight for them to me it pretty basic if you re working hour week you shouldn be living in poverty that why support minimum wage gavin is leading the way in california so tired of trickle down economics it about time we build from the bottom up and the middle out so california keep gavin and send message this time give working people just fighting chance they have never ever ever ever ever let the country down all they want is just an even shot they have never let the country down folks can go on but here the deal going to make this as simple as can you either keep gavin newsom as your governor or you ll get donald trump it not joke republican governor blocking progress on covid who is also anti woman anti worker climate denier who doesn believe in choice the choice should be absolutely gavin newsom you have governor who has the courage to lead in gavin you have governor who shares the state values in gavin you have governor to make sure donald trump dark destructive division politics never finds place in california so please not joke on behalf of the people of delaware and pennsylvania and minnesota and all across america don take anything for granted if you re registered you ve got ballot in the mail if you haven opened it open it mark no and put in the mailbox tonight if you want to vote in person make sure you know where you re going to vote in your county if you ve already voted make sure your family and friends are voting tomorrow california mean this is sincerely the eyes of the nation are on you not joking not joking about that you ve got to vote no on the recall keep gavin as governor the rest of america is counting on you and so am god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you hello new jersey thank you lieutenant commander inaudible well governor murphy so many of the national challenges we re confronting are areas where you re already leading and that not hyperbole whether it making healthcare or preschool or college more affordable providing paid family leave replacing lead in pipes and protecting public health so thanks for showing the way pal thanks for showing the way it also good to meet my old friend lot of my friends in congress but bill you and have been doing this long time pal thanks for the passport back in new jersey and your district and josh scottheimer has been the best go between ve had trying to get all this done whether it the build back better portion or the infrastructure proportion and tom malinowski done on hell of job and don payne and frank palone keep telling frank remind him we ve been doing things together long time know delaware small know how important new jersey is but delaware owns the delaware river up to the high watermark in new jersey so you know what mean and one of my favorite members of congress who campaigned for and she won in spite of it mikie sherrill lieutenant commander in the united states navy naval graduate georgetown law incredible person and want to acknowledge both senator booker and menendez who represent you so well in washington they re down there trying to get this all moving here today to talk about what fundamentally at stake for the families of new jersey the whole region here and for our country for most of the th century we led the world by significant margin not just led the world by significant margin because we invested in ourselves we invested in our people not only in our roads and our highways and our bridges but in our people and our families we re among the first to provide access to free education years of free education for anyone who was in american beginning back in the late hundreds in the early and that decision to invest in our children and our families was major part major part of why we were able to lead the world for so much of the th century but somewhere along the way we took our eyes off the ball our infrastructure used to be the best in the world not hyperbole the best in the world today according to the world economic forum we ranked th in the world of our nations have superior infrastructure to us and china has trains to go miles an hour for long distances and we got money to do that back in the administration of barack obama and joe biden and you had republican governor who didn want any parts of it we used to lead the world in educational achievement now the organization of economic cooperation and development ranks america out of countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care out of early childhood education and care out of we cannot be competitive in the st century global economy if we continue to slide my wife who community college professor says any nation that out educates us will out compete us say it again any nation that out educates will out compete us and that fact that why resolve that we once again build america from the bottom up and the middle out ve never seen time in american history when the middle class did well the wealthy didn do very well but tired of trickle down trickle down hadn worked so much for the last years for working class and middle class folks that why proposed two critical pieces of legislation being debated back in washington right now these bills are not about left versus right or moderate versus progressive or anything that pits one american against another these bills are about competitiveness versus complacency competitiveness versus complacency they re about expanding opportunity not opportunity denied they re about leading the world or continuing to let the world pass us by first the infrastructure bill it about rebuilding the arteries of america and the portal bridge project is showing why investments like this are so important when the portal bridge was built it was state of the art and it really was but years ago today it been called something different choke point bottleneck and achilles heel in the northeast corridor since the portal bridge was built it become the busiest rail span in the entire western hemisphere let me say that again it the busiest rail span in the entire western hemisphere at peak usage trains pass over it every day amtrak and new jersey transit passengers but ships and barges also need to get under it and many can fit that means the bridges need to swing open and closed again process that stops rail traffic and causes other problems the bridge opens over times year and of the time something goes wrong of the time for example if the rails don lock back in place exactly right the bridge closes and sometimes you know what fixes it in the st century sledgehammer come out with sledgehammer and align the tracks literally sledgehammer to knock it back into place in the year one report couple years ago found that the portal bridge was particularly responsible for hours of delays between and know the little expression time is money as one commuter said if you re on the train and they say portal bridge you know you better make other plans aging infrastructure like this is more than an inconvenience or nuisance it an impediment impediment to america global competitiveness we re in worldwide race things have changed take look that why what happening right now is so important today we re moving forward on new bridge that will be higher over the water so it won need to open and close allow us to increase speed safety and efficiency and capacity this is going to make life lot better for new jersey commuters it also going to create nearly construction jobs in this area alone this area workers union jobs union it was pointed out to me not long ago that said union president that ve apparently used someone calculated used the word union more than the last seven presidents combined because guess what it decent wage it about to make rail transportation which is cleaner greener way to travel the better choice for lot of new jersey residents but not just new jersey everybody up and down east coast if can pause for second apologize because some have heard this commuted every single day miles day on amtrak from the time got elected united states senator as matter of fact when was vice president used to like to take the train home because my mom was very sick and dying and come home every weekend to make sure take the train home and the secret service and not criticizing them legitimately would rather me fly because it safer because too many people can get on an off et cetera getting on one friday and then one of the senior guys on amtrak angelo negri got know all the conductors really well they became my friends really my genuine friends have them at my home at christmas and during the summer and ang walks up to me and goes joey baby grabs my cheek and thought the secret service was going to blow his head off said swear to god true story said no no he friend say what up ang he said joey read in the paper read in the paper you travel miles on air force planes because they keep meticulous tabs of it said yeah he said big won say the whole thing big deal you know how many miles you travel on amtrak joey and said no he said the boys and figured out at the retirement dinner he said you traveled two million think it was but miles said how you get that ang he said well miles day we figured you traveled days year for years and then you traveled as vice president he goes joey don want to hear this about the air force anymore train guy because it also is the single most significant way we can deal with air pollution single most significant way we can deal with global warming it going to help the region vital maritime industry as well by making the movement of ships and bridges safer and more efficient look with my infrastructure bill we re going to make sure projects like this are just the beginning across the country there are bridges in disrepair some of them dangerously so miles of roads are on poor condition we re going to create them totally new we re going to fix them this is going to be good union jobs prevailing wage you can raise family on jobs that can be outsourced we re going to make the largest investment in public transportation in the history of america replacing transit vehicles that are past their useful life and make the most significant investment in rail since the creation of amtrak years ago during peak periods when railroads are congested and rail carriers have more passengers rail is up to times more energy efficient than person driving times we have huge opportunity here to provide fast safe reliable and clean transportation in this country every study shows won bore you with them all because ve been working on them my whole life every study shows if you can get from point to point faster on rail than you can drive your automobile you take the rail the northeast corridor we re talking about billion investments in major project like the hudson river gateway tunnels and the portal bridge which it feeds into look we re going to create job replacing lead water pipes so families can drink clean water something new jersey and governor murphy have been leading on we re going to make sure high speed internet is affordable and available everywhere in america including in the nearly one in three new jersey families that don have the internet subscription how many times you see people pulling up to mcdonald sitting outside during the pandemic so they could do their homework because they can get off of their line we re going to create jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines to build modern resilient an energy grid and we re going to invest in strengthening our infrastructure against the impacts of climate change the governor and were talking little bit earlier just this year global warming has caused over billion dollars billion in damage visited new jersey as the governor mentioned after the hurricane ida came through the governor and several of you were with me in manville we met people who had been put out of their homes by flooding it was devastating water marks over people heads they show me where the water gotten to told them that help was on the way since then fema processed assistance applications for nearly new jerseyans and approved million in repairs replacement and rental assistance and other needs between and this state has had extreme weather events nationally extreme weather as said cost it nationally extreme weather as said cost the taxpayers over billion year our plan is going to build our roads higher our levies stronger our power grids more durable all to withstand the ever increasing ferocity and intensity of extreme weather and with my build back better plans we re going to address the root cause of ever increasing extreme weather and destruction the climate crisis we have climate crisis ve flown all over this nation this year in helicopters gone from lake mead more land has been burned to the ground in the west to the ground forest homes than the entire state of new jersey from all the way down to cape may all the way up to the hudson that how much is burned to the ground my infrastructure bill was always part of america work for long overdue national environmental cleanups like clean up passaic river the nation most expensive superfund site we re going to invest billion in modernizing and electrifying our ports and airports like the port of new york and new jersey newark liberty international airport reducing congestion and emissions and creating thousands more good paying union jobs it going to help us meet the moment of the climate crisis in way that creates good jobs make us more economically competitive and we can breathe look we haven passed the transformative infrastructure bill for decade think about this how many times under the former guy did we have infrastructure week not single thing happened we need to get this done and it isn enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure we also have to invest in our people that what my second pill the build back better plan does just had the opportunity to visit preschool in the east end elementary in north plainfield north plainfield provides access to preschool for all kids four years and above my plan is going to make it possible for the district to expand that program to three year olds all across america the earlier our children began to learn the better for themselves their families and for the nation studies show that children who have attended high quality preschool are more likely to finish high school and get two or four year degree after high school but right now we re lagging behind today only about half of three and four year olds in america are enrolled in early education in germany france the uk and even latvia that number is over over of three and four year olds are in school my build back better plan gets us back on track we ll make two years of high quality preschool available to every child in america an average two parent household in this state spends to care for just

spend more than of their income on childcare we also extended historic middle class tax cuts for parents by expanding the childcare tax credit everybody talks about children and josh has heard me say it view it as tax cut for middle class families tax cut we never have an argument when we talk about with the wealthy this is tax cut it changes the lives of the american people as many people here in

is this given half chance the american people have never ever ever let their country down so let get this done let move folks we have the most talented workforce in the world what are we doing what in god name are we doing and by the way you hear these numbers trillion or trillion we pay for it all it doesn increase the deficit one single cent so let get to work let put people to work and let once again reestablish america as the most advanced country in the world god bless our america and god bless our troops thank you thank you thank you the civil rights movement left us with this wisdom give people light and they will find the way give people light those are words for our time the current president has cloaked america in darkness for much too long too much anger too much fear too much division here and now give you my word if you entrust me with the presidency will draw on the best of us not the worst ll be an ally of the light not the darkness it time for us for we the people to come together and make no mistake united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in america we ll choose hope over fear facts over fiction fairness over privilege proud democrat and ll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election so it with great honor and humility accept this nomination for president of the united states of america but while ll be democratic candidate will be an american president ll work hard for those who didn support me as hard for them as did for those who did vote for me that the job of president to represent all of us not just our base or our party this is not partisan moment this must be an american moment it moment that calls for hope and light and love hope for our future light to see our way forward and love for one another america isn just collection of clashing interest of red states or blue states we re so much bigger than that we re so much better than that now nearly century ago franklin roosevelt pledged new deal in time of massive unemployment uncertainty and fear stricken by disease stricken by virus fdr insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed america could as well and he did and we can as well this campaign isn just about winning votes it about winning the heart and yes the soul of america winning it for the generous among us not the selfish winning it for workers who keep this country going not just the privileged few at the top winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of knee on the neck for all of the young people who have known only america being rising inequity and shrinking opportunity they deserve the experience of america promise they deserve to experience it in full no generation never knows what history will ask of it all we can ever know is whether we re ready when that moment arrives and now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments america ever faced four four historic crises all at the same time perfect storm the worst pandemic in over hundred years the worst economic crisis since the great depression the most compelling call for racial justice since the sixties and the undeniable and just the accelerating threats of climate change so the question for us is simple are we ready believe we are we must be all elections are important but we know in our bones this one is more consequential as many have said america at an inflection point time of real peril but also of extraordinary possibilities we can choose path of becoming angrier less hopeful more divided path of shadow and suspicion or we can choose different path and together take this chance to heal to reform to unite path of hope and light this is life changing election this will determine what america is going to look like for long long time character is on the ballot compassion is on the ballot decency science democracy they re all on the ballot who we are as nation what we stand for and most importantly who we want to be that all on the ballot and the choice could not be more clear no rhetoric is needed just judge this president on the facts million americans infected by covid more than americans have died by far the worst performance of any nation on earth more than million people have filed for unemployment this year more than million people are going to lose their health insurance this year nearly one in six small businesses have closed this year and this president if he re elected you know what will happen cases and deaths will remain far too high more mom and pop businesses will close their doors and this time for good working families will struggle to get by and yet the wealthiest will get tens of billions of dollars in new taxes breaks and the assault on the affordable care act will continue until it destroyed taking insurance away from more than million people including more than million people on medicaid and getting rid of the protections that president obama worked so hard to get passed for hundred million more people who have preexisting conditions and speaking of president obama man was honored to serve alongside for eight years as vice president let me take this moment to say something we don say nearly enough thank you mr president you were great president president that our children could and did look up to no one going to say that about the current occupant of the white house what you know about this president is if he given four more years he ll be what he been for the last four years the president takes no responsibility refuses to lead blames others cozies up to dictators and fans the flames of hate and division he ll wake up every day believing that job is all about him never about you is that the america you want for you your family your children see different america one that generous and strong selfless and humble it an america we could rebuild together as president the first step will take would be to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives because understand something this president hasn from the beginning we will never get our economy back on track we will never get our kids safely back in schools we ll never have our lives back until we deal with this virus the tragedy of where we are today is it didn have to be this bad just look around it not this bad in canada or europe or japan or almost anywhere else in the world and the president keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear he keeps waiting for miracle well have news for him no miracle is coming we lead the world in confirmed cases we lead the world in deaths our economy is in tatters with black latino asian american native american communities bearing the brunt of it and after all this time the president still does not have plan well do if your president on day one we ll implement the national strategy ve been laying out since march we ll develop and deploy rapid tests for the results available immediately we ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs and we ll make them here in america so we will never again be at the mercy of china or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people we ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open safe and effective we ll put politics aside we ll take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve honest unvarnished truth they can handle it we ll have national mandate to wear mask not as burden but as patriotic duty to protect one another in short we ll do what we should have done from the very beginning our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation he failed to protect us he failed to protect america and my fellow americans that is unforgivable as president ll make you promise ll protect america will defend us from every attack seen and unseen always without exception every time look understand understand how hard it is to have any hope right now on this summer night let me take moment to speak to those you who have lost the most have some idea how it feels to lose someone you love know that deep black hole that opens up in the middle of your chest and you feel like you re being sucked into it know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes but ve learned two things first your loved one may have left this earth but they ll never leave your heart they ll always be with you you always hear them and second ve found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose as god children each of us have purpose in our lives we have great purpose as nation to open the doors of opportunity to all americans to save our democracy to be light to the world once again and finally to live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness my dad was an honorable decent man he got knocked down few times pretty hard but he always got back up he worked hard and he built great middle class life for our family he used to say joey don expect the government to solve my problems but sure in hell expect them to understand them and then he say joey job is about lot more than paycheck it about your dignity it about respect it about your place in the community it about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it going to be okay and mean it thank you kamala thank you all so very much mr president harry thank you for your stewardship here in the heart of the capital of the united states of america the tensions and the heat of the nation are vividly on display dr king stands determined and brave looking out at the promised land across the tidal basin stands another giant of our history thomas jefferson whose words declared the very idea of america that we are all created equal endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights we re all deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives to state the obvious and no audience knows it better than this one we ve never lived up to that idea but we ve never walked away from it fully we ve never walked away in his sermon to the march in washington dr king called on all america to live up to the full meaning and promise of our declaration of independence and so stand here in perpetuity in timely and timeless conversation that inspires us and challenges us reminds us how far we ve come where we need to go and how much longer the journey is it conversation that shapes our days and that we must carry forward madam vice president madam speaker chair of the black caucus pd congressional black caucus members the moral foundation leaders of faith and community distinguished guests from here we see the ongoing push and pull between progress and struggle over the self evident truths of our democracy and in our nation we now face an inflection point and the battle literal for the soul of america and it up to us together to choose who we want to be and what we want to be know the progress does not come fast enough it never has and the process of governing is frustrating and sometimes disparaging but also know what possible if we keep the pressure up if we never give up if we keep the faith we re at an inflection point know ve maybe overused that phrase but it is an inflection point in american history and delivering on economic justice or was the dignity of work that dr king was in memphis on that fateful day in april helping sanitation workers not only for better pay and safer conditions but to be granted more dignity as human beings in our time it about recognizing that for much too long we ve allowed narrow and cramped view of the promise of america view that america zero sum game particularly of the recent past if you succeed fail if you get ahead fall behind and maybe worst of all if can hold you down lift myself up instead of what it should be and it just self evident if you do well we all do well that keeping the promise of america ve never seen time when working folks did well that the wealthy didn do very well look it the core of our administration economic vision and it fundamental paradigm shift for this nation for the first time in couple generations we re going to be investing in working families putting them first and helping them get ahead rather than the wealthy and the biggest and most powerful people out there we re investing in black families with rescue checks and tax cuts that reduce black poverty by black child poverty by more than this year and we re aggressively with the leadership of some of the people looking at right now combating housing discrimination to create generation of wealth how did every other person make it the middle class from working class circumstance just like my dad did build equity in house granted it was small granted it wasn much but it was enough to build little equity we ll use the federal government purchasing power to unlock billions of dollars in new opportunities of minority owned small businesses and access to government contracts is there any doubt that providing more people with just little more breathing room to take care of their families generate little bit of wealth that they can pass on to their children and create jobs in their communities would uplift the entire country all the country everyone and as the economy recovers we are determined and focused on rebuilding it over the long run no one should have to hold their breath as they cross rundown bridge to determine whether it safe enough or dangerous intersection in their hometown nation every american every child should be able to turn on faucet and drink water that not contaminated by lead or anything else as nation everyone should have access to affordable high speed internet gone the days when you have to pull up to mcdonald and sit in parking lot with your child to do their homework when there virtual learning going on dr king said of all the forms of inequity injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and most inhumane this is once in century pandemic that hit this country hard and especially the african american community it like you ve all lost someone to the virus or know someone who has lost loved one one in black americans have died from covid and it been reported that black children more than twice as likely as white children to have lost parent or caregiver to covid to have to experience the trauma and loss many of my colleagues in the congress are working on what we have to now work on even more fervently and that is mental health care helping people through the difficult periods we have it been devastating but we can find purpose in pain we can find purpose in this pain equity is the center of my administration covid response the vaccination rates among black adults is now essentially on par with white adults the midst of this pandemic we re building an affordable care act to extend coverage to lower healthcare costs for millions of black families we re also working to lower prescription drug costs by giving medicare the power to negotiate lower prices and how do you know the plan will work because the drug companies are spending millions od bucks to try to stop it that how you know together we re making healthcare right not privilege in this nation and for the millions the millions of you who feel financially squeezed in raising child while caring for an aging parent so called sandwich generation want to elder care affordable accessible so your aging loved ones can live with greater independence and dignity we also want to make sure childcare costs for most families are cut at least in half no working family if we get what you all are helping me get done no working family in america will pay more than of their income on childcare for any child under five want to give raises and millions of care workers and home workers so they can increase their capacity increase their knowledge increase their opportunities health workers and childcare workers are disproportionately women women of color and immigrants workers like the ones dr king stood for when he marched and gave his life look folks just imagine instead of consigning millions of our children to under resourced schools we gave every single child in america access to an education at age three and age four quality preschool we could afford to do this we can afford not to do it and we do know no matter what the background or circumstance child comes from when given that opportunity they have better than chance to make it all the way through years without getting themselves in trouble and maybe going beyond that this will change lives forever so will historic investments in higher education significantly increasing pell grants to help millions of black students in lower income families attend community colleges and four year schools ll tell you let me be clear in the shadow of the morehouse men hear lot about that guys and with the howard alumni keep making the case of excuses at point of personal privilege inaudible senate the best hbcu in the country is delaware state that where got started come on but here what we ve done in addition to putting the president of delaware state he used to work for doctor in charge of all of this we re committed to nearly billion this year in historic investments with more historically black colleges universities to make every single student give him shot at the good paying jobs and you all know what mean but for anybody watching this one of the problems is black students and collegers used to have every single capability any other student does but guess what because they don have great endowments they can compete for those government contracts are out there that the big schools are able to go out and get cyber security for example starting salary is bucks but you don get to get that contract unless you have laboratories unless you have the facilities you can in fact train on we also know this about the promise of america economic injustice also means delivering environmental justice to communities on fence line communities dividing homes and toxic areas my state has one of the highest cancer rates in the history in america because lived in fence line community called claymont delaware we used to get up in the morning not joke when get driven to the little school went up the street turned on the windshield wiper in the fall of the first frost and literally be an oil slick in the window not joke an oil slick in the window that why an awful lot of us including me have bronchial asthma it means reducing pollution so our children can develop and avoid these consequences every one of you have an alley in your state we call cancer alley in our state going down route look it means building up our resilience through the climate crisis for the next extreme weather events and these have been of biblical proportions biblical proportions mile top winds in the hurricane down in louisiana more people dying in queens in their basements because inches of rain they flooded and couldn get out of their basements they drowned superstorms droughts wildfire hurricanes this is the for america urban and rural and all across america not just for any one area and as we fight for economic justice to fulfill the promise of america for all americans the work continues on delivering equal justice under the law look know the frustration we all feel that more than one year after george floyd murder and the conviction of his murderer about six months ago meaningful police reform in george name is still not past congress remember many times meeting with little daughter and she say to me my daddy changing history he going to change history but we haven fulfilled that yet understand you got to keep fighting let me be clear though we re going to continue to fight for real police reform legislation and the fight not anywhere near over despite republican instruction my administration is active we ve already announced changes in the federal law enforcement policies ban on choke holds restriction on no knock warrants requirements that federal agents wear and activate body cameras ending department of justice use of private prisons rescinding the previous administration guidance to us attorneys to require the harshest of penalties the justice department has open pattern of practice investigation of systematic police misconduct and police departments in phoenix louisville and minneapolis just because we can get it done in the states we are not standing back but we have much more to do and these important steps my administration also wants to advance some meaningful police reform that includes additional executive actions that live up to america promise of equal justice under the law our work continues to create safer and stronger communities in critical ways with my american rescue plan and thank you and the congress for supporting it everybody forgets that was trillion we got heck of lot done with that that it did so well people don even know where it came from oh serious think about it what you do for me lately well we had billion we took care of well we made historic investments in community policing and violence intervention programs and we re shown to reduce some of these programs reduce violence by we re expanding summer programs and job opportunities and service and support to keep young people safe and out of trouble helping formally incarcerated people successfully re enter their communities in the past you get bucks and bus ticket you go back right into the bridge you just were there before you should have access to pell grants you should have access to the housing you should have access to all the things you paid your price and we shouldn put you back in the spot where you have no options we re also working to stem the flow of firearms from rogue gun dealers to curb the epidemic of gun violence know get criticized for being the guy who passed this assault weapons ban proud of having passed the assault weapons ban but here the deal we heard dr king paraphrase micah he said give us the ballot and we will place judges on the benches of the south who will do justly and love mercy well in just nine months we ve appointed more black women to circuit courts and more former public defenders of events than any administration in all of american history because of you we re going to change it we did it in record time and we re just getting started because all of you in the audience here you ve been the engine behind all of this but we also know this to make real the full promise america we have to protect that fundamental right the right to vote the sacred right to vote it democracy threshold liberty with it anything possible without it nothing is today the right to vote and the rule of all are under unrelenting assault from republican governors attorney general secretary of state state legislators and they re following my predecessor the last president into deep deep black hole and abyss no really mean it think about it this is what got me involved in civil rights as kid when was years old loved reading about how biden knew he was going to run for president hell didn know was even going to be able to run for the county council didn even want to but look this struggle is no longer just over who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible people to vote it about who gets to count the votes whether they should count at all jim crow in the st century is now sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion my fellow americans thought at one point that had been able to do something good as chairman of the judiciary committee was able to get every member of the committee including some of the most conservative members that ever served clearly who had racist backgrounds to vote to extend the voting right act for years thought whoa one of the proudest things ever did as senator but guess what this means that some state legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote and if you do vote they want to be able to tell you whether or not your vote counts that not happened before they want the ability to reject the final vote and ignore the will of the people if they re preferred candidate black or white or asian or latino doesn matter if that their candidate doesn win and they re targeting not just voters of color as said but every voter who doesn vote the way they want have to admit to you have been as senator my whole year career involved in as ve worked with lot of folks out here in civil rights issues thought man you can turn this back thought you could defeat hate thought we could actually defeat hate but the most un american thing that any of us can imagine the most undemocratic and the most unpatriotic and yet sadly not unprecedented time and again we ve inaudible the threats to the right to vote and free and fair elections come to fruition each time we fought back and we ve got to continue to fight back today want to thank martin luther king iii for leading marches on voting rights during the anniversary of the march on washington on august th the vice president and and our colleagues here have spent our careers doing this work it central to our administration on the anniversary of bloody sunday directed each and every federal to promote access to voting from each agency heeding that call for example the department of veterans affairs asked them to make it easier for veterans and their families to register and to vote at va facilities so be open in addition the us department of justice has double the voting rights enforcement staff we got long way to go though it using authorities to challenge the onslaught of state laws undermining voting rights whether in older new ways to something like or half the republicans am not your president donald trump is still your president as we catholics say oh my god but look the focus is going to remain on discrimination and racial discriminatory laws georgia various new anti voting laws and let be clear about georgia dr king home state and the home state of someone who has literally stood in his shoes think some of you guys knew this next line was coming that why you had the jets come up stood in his shoes as morehouse man that what keep getting from cedric oh anyway and as preacher in the pulpit of ebeneezer united states senator rafael warnock the first black senator in georgia history senator warnock won his election in the battle of ideas he earned the trust and confidence of broad coalition of voters in georgia in response of republicans of georgia what was it it not try winning on the merits and ideas it by changing the rules to make it harder for people to vote deny the franchise the vice president has been leading our administration efforts and we ve supported democrats pressing to enact critical voting rights bills since day one of this administration making sure we have unanimous support but each and every time the senate republicans block it by refusing even to talk about it they re afraid to even just debate the bills in the us senate as they did again yesterday even on bill that includes provisions that they ve traditionally supported it unfair it unconscionable and it un american and this battle far from over the door has not been closed john lewis voting right act will soon come up for vote named after our dear friend we still miss dearly but whose voice we hear every day in our hearts and our conscience it law that helped lead the reauthorization as said for years that served in the senate judiciary committee expanding the voting rights act traditionally received bipartisan support we have to keep up the fight and get it done and know the moment we re in you know the moment we re in know the stakes you know the stakes this is far from over and finally we re confronting the stains of what remains the deep stain in the soul of the nation hate and white supremacy there tough through line of subjugation with slave people from our earliest days to the reigns of radicalized terror the kkk to dr king being assassinated and though that that line continues to be the torches emerging from dark shadows in charlottesville carrying out nazi banners and chanting antisemitic bile and ku klux klan flags and the violent deadly insurrection on the capitol nine months ago it was about white supremacy in my view the rise of hate crimes against asian americans during the pandemic and the rise of antisemitism here in america and around the world the through line is that never goes away in all the years ve been involved thought once we got through it it would go away but it doesn it only hides it only hides until some seeming legitimate person breathes some oxygen under the rocks where they re hiding and gives us some breath ve said it before and all my colleagues here know it according to the united states intelligence community domestic terrorism from white supremacists is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland to that end our administration is carrying out the first ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat posed by domestic terrorism including white supremacy we re doing so by taking action and reduce online radicalism and recruitment to violence we re also disrupting networks that inspire violence and domestic terrorists by providing resources to communities to build resilience we cannot and must not give hate any safe harbor any safe harbor my fellow americans standing here reminded of the goal of the southern christian leadership conference which dr king led and quote he said his goal was to redeem the soul of america that what at stake here the soul of america and we know that it not the work of single day or single administration or even single generation but here we stand with dr king to show out of struggle there progress out of despair there hope from the promise of equality and opportunity of jobs justice and freedom we see black excellence american excellence black history as american history and defining source of the might of this nation that why we re here today to renew our own courage in the shadow and the light on the shoulders of dr king curtis scott king and all those known and unknown who gave their whole souls to this work the courage to confront wrong and to try to do right the courage to heal the broken places of the nation the courage to see america whole to acknowledge where we fall short to devote ourselves with the perfection of the union that we love and we must protect fo if we can summon the courage to do these things we ll have done our duty honored our commitments brought the dream of dr king just little bit of closer to reality it the highest of callings it the most sacred of charges and it what with the help of god we can do now so let go forth from this sacred place tumbling in turmoil with hope and promise of nation always seeking always thriving always keeping the faith because folks know my colleagues in the senate used to always kid me for quoting irish poets on the floor they thought did it because was irish it not the reason they re just the best poets in the world and believe this to be true there line from poem of the cure of troy and says once in lifetime that tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme it not the whole quote won bore you at all but hope and history rhyme believe the american people the vast majority are with us think they see much more clearly what you ve all been fighting for your whole life now it in stark relief the bad news is we had president who appealed to the prejudice the good news is that he ripped the bandaid off made it absolutely clear what at stake and think the american people will follow us but guess what whether they will or not we have no choice we have to continue to fight god bless you all and may god protect our troops ve never forgotten those lessons that why my economic plan is all about jobs dignity respect and community together we can and will rebuild our economy and when we do we ll not only build back we ll build back better with modern roads bridges highways broadband ports and airports as new foundation for economic growth with pipes of transport clean water to every community with million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in america with healthcare system that lowers premiums deductibles drug prices by building on the affordable care act he trying to rip away with an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the st century there not single thing american workers can do and where cost doesn prevent young people from going to college and student debt doesn crush them when they get out with childcare and eldercare system that makes it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity with an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values and with newly empowered labor unions they re the ones that build the middle class with equal pay for women with rising wages you could raise child on family on and yes we re going to do more than praise our essential workers we re finally going to pay them pay them we can and we will deal with climate change it not only crisis it an enormous opportunity an opportunity for america to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good paying jobs in the process and we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes unnecessary loopholes and the president trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest and the biggest most profitable corporations some of which do not pay any tax at all because we don need tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work not looking to punish anyone far from it but it long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share and for our seniors social security is sacred obligation sacred promise made they paid for the current president is threatening to break that promise he proposing to eliminate tax that pays for almost half the social security without any way of making up for that loss revenue resulting in cuts will not let that happen if your president we re going to protect social security and medicare you have my word one of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people they re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in america economic injustice racial injustice environmental injustice hear their voices if you listen you can hear them too and whether it the existential threat posed by climate change the daily fear of being gunned down in school or the inability to get started in your first job it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of america to everyone and not going to have to do it alone because ll have great vice president at my side senator kamala harris she powerful voice for this nation her story is the american story she knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country women black women black americans south asian americans immigrants the left out and the left behind but she overcome every obstacle she ever faced no one been tougher on the big banks and the gun lobby no one has been tougher in calling out the current administration for its extremism its failure to follow the law its failure to simply tell the truth kamala and both draw from our families that where we get our strength for kamala it doug and their families for me it jill and ours ve said many times no man deserves one great love in his life let alone two but ve known two after losing my first wife in that car accident jill came into my life she put our family back together she an educator mom military mom and an unstoppable force if she puts her mind to it just get out of the way she going to get it done she was great second lady and know she ll make great first lady for this nation she loves this country so much and ll always have the strength that can only come from family hunter ashley all our grandchildren my brothers my sister they give me courage they lift me up while he no longer with us beau inspires me every day beau served our nation in uniform year in iraq decorated iraqi war veteran so take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as commander in chief ll be president who ll stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators is over under president biden america will not turn blind eye to russian bounties on their heads of american soldiers nor will put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise voting and ll always stand for our values of human rights and dignity ll work in common purpose for more secure peaceful and prosperous world history has thrust one more urgent task on us will we be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character believe we re up to it believe we re ready just week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in charlottesville close your eyes remember what you saw on television remember seeing those neo nazis and klansmen and white supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches veins bulging spewing the same anti semitic bile heard across europe in the thirties remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it remember what the president said when asked he said they were very fine people on both sides it was wake up call for us as country and for me call to action at that moment knew have to run because my father taught us that silence was complicity and can never remain silent or complicit at the time said we re in the battle for the soul of this nation and we are one of the most important conversations ve had this entire campaign it was so someone who was much too young to vote met with six year old gianna floyd the day before her daddy george lloyd was laid to rest she an incredibly brave little girl and ll never forget it when leaned down to speak to her she looked in my eyes and she said and quote daddy changed the world daddy changed the world her words burrowed deep into my heart maybe george floyd murder was breaking point maybe john lewis passing is the inspiration but however it come to be however it happened america ready in john words to lay down quote the heavy burden of hate at last and in the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism american history tells us that it been in our darkest moments that we ve made our greatest progress that we found the light in this dark moment believe we re poised to make great progress again that we can find the light once more many people have heard me say this but ve always believed you can define america in one word possibilities the defining feature of america everything is possible that in america everyone and mean everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and god given ability will take them we can never lose that in times as challenging as these believe there only one way forward as united america united america united in our pursuit of more perfect union united in our dreams of better future for us and for our children united in our determination to make the coming years bright are you ready believe we are this is great nation we re good and decent people for lord sake this is the united states of america and there never been anything we ve been able to accomplish when we ve done it together the irish poet seamus heaney once wrote history says don hope on this

it been an awful lot of time across from st paul church at my uncle jack finnegan house his daughters are here and he taught up at the and just want you to know that amtrak is here they can tell you that you should name half the line after me am the most railroad guy you re ever going to meet miles on amtrak hear me now not joke what happened was when you are president or vice president they keep meticulous mileage of when you fly an air force aircraft and so about guess it was seven years in to my tenure as vice president and used to always like to take amtrak home on friday tried to go home and see my mom who was living with us at the time after my dad passed and tried to get home and the secret service are wonderful they re the best in the world they never liked me taking amtrak because it stops too often and too many people get on and you don know but it turned out was about number three in seniority on the road at the time if you now well mean terms of actual time on the road and lot of the folks in amtrak became my family not joke ride every day commuted every single day for years as vice president of the united states after my wife and daughter were killed went home to see my family never stopped doing that and so angelo negri was from you remember ang ang came up to me one day when they just had announced that had flown one million some number of miles on air force aircraft and ang comes up and getting in the car and he goes joey baby what do you and thought the secret service were going to shoot him said no no no no he good he good it true story and he said just read big deal big deal whatever it was million miles air force you know how many miles you did amtrak and said no ang don have any idea pal he said let me tell you we were at the retirement dinner and he said we added it up you averaged hundred think he says days year days year years plus as vice president boom boom you have traveled over two million miles joe don want to hear anymore about the air force but in the build back better plan got more money for passenger rail than the entire amtrak system cost to begin with we re going to change the nation in big way shane want to thank you for the introduction really do and madam mayor paige you ve done great job great great job no really mean it big fan when got elected it the god truth after checked on what the margin was in the state of delaware called up here she had won that year too and found out that won every precinct in scranton and looked up and said mom did it did it and it great to be here it great to be here in pennsylvania with very close friend become close friend and great governor governor wolf it good to see you and matt thank you for the passport to let me back into the district it interesting grew up not very far from bobby excuse me the senator where he grew up it was about total of if you added up think it was about five blocks six blocks and his dad and were about years apart and we re years apart so it like continuum going down here but just want you to know we went to the same schools the same parish just few years apart give few take few years and scranton is where played shortstop at the green ridge little league in the first year that it was put up my dad helped build the field down there and spent lot of time at semi buying penny candy and hanks hoagies on woodlawn street watching movies of the roosie on the weekend and trying to reenact all they did and when you watch those movies think was told know there true was the only kid in my era that was able to walk across on that pipe that was just above that thing if you found the lackey you weren lucky you were in trouble but anyway that right look no matter how long you live here in scranton it place that climbs into your heart and it never really leaves you and that the god truth it like that old saying goes you can take the boy out of scranton but you can take scranton out of the boy there something special about it and believe that home is where your character is etched and really mean that some of you have heard me say this before it where your view of the world begins and where you begin and where it takes shape and that happened to me in north washington avenue we used to come back after mass at st paul st claire wasn built till had moved at st paul and my grandfather would hold court and back in those days all the men had breakfast in the kitchen my mother was one of five children four brothers one was lost in world war ii and guy who was the chief political reporter at the newspaper tommy phillips who lived the street behind us and was good friend of my grandfather and all the women would go in the dining room and on the lace table cloth and have tea and in the dining room on the lace tablecloth and have tea and the men would in fact have big breakfast and if you re kid if you re young boy you could sort of wander around the table you could never sit at the table and so used every once in while walk in and just sort of wander around stand by my grandpa and put my hand on his shoulder and they talk and they talked about everything from sports and politics and that where learned an awful lot at that kitchen table learned from my grandpa that money done and determine your worth learned he told me and that not joke those of you know me know it to be true and you guys know it is that mo one in the world is more worthy than you joey but everyone your equal everybody your equal my mom would remind me she say joey this is god truth remember you re defined by you re your courage and you re redeemed by your loyalty you re defined by your courage and you re redeemed by your loyalty and my dad when things got tough in scranton after the war when there weren any work my dad did not work in coal mines my great grandfather was mining engineer but my dad was in sales and he worked for the inaudible trucking company and things got slow in scranton so we moved remember the day he came think the longest walk parent can make is up short flight of stairs to tell their kid you can live here anymore you can because dad doesn have job or mom doesn have job and my dad had moved from wilmington delaware to scranton when he was junior in high school then was called st thomas not the prep but it was called st thomas in those days and remember him walking up into the bedroom and saying honey dad going to have to move but it going to probably take about year ll come home every single weekend it only miles thought that would was miles away ll come home every weekend and when we get enough money going to bring you and mom and everyone down to wilmington you re going to like it and thought that was like an awful lot of parents who left scranton back in those days who moved away had to move away and gained so much respect for my father as got older because thought about how much it must have hurt him and the pride it took it from to walk into my grandfather pantry and say ambrose can leave jean and the kids with you promise ll make it up to you ll be back every weekend but promise ll make it up that hard thing for proud man or woman to do but so many had to do it and remember when we moved down to delaware my dad would say joey and all my friends know this literally this phrase you ve heard him say it don know how many times joey job about lot more than paycheck it about your dignity it about respect it about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it going to be okay and think about it think about what it is it means lot more than just whether you get paycheck it defines who you are in his mind and learned that at the kitchen table in scranton the place where you take care of one another and as said used to stutter badly when was kid if tommy bell and charlie inaudible and all of my old friends were here at st pauls my nickname was blackbird it was bye bye blackbird it wasn meant as compliment and wasn very big you could beat me but hurt you you think kidding not but it one of those things that was for because the people was surrounded by our neighbors in scranton as well that people stuck up for you stuck up for one another and my mother used to say and never quite understood remember joey look at me look at me joey you re biden like dupont or something you know what mean swear to god you re biden nobody is better than you and everybody equal to you nobody the point making is the truth is scranton isn my home because of the memories it gave me it my home because of the values it gave me so when ran for president and came back to scranton came back to scranton started here in scranton and resolved to bring scranton values to bear to make fundamental shift in how our economy works for working people to build the economy from the ground up and the middle out not from the top down ve never known time in the middle class has done well the wealthy haven done very very well ve never known such time so here today to talk about what fundamentally at stake right now for the families and for our country for most of the th century we led the world by significant margin because we invested in our people we invested in ourselves not only in our roads and our highways and our bridges but in our people and our families we didn just build interstate eight highway system we built highway to the sky to outer space also we invested to win the space race and we won we re also among the first to provide access to free education beginning back in the late early we invested in our children does anybody think today if we were making that decision for the first time we say years is enough in the st century years is enough it not but back then they did and it reason why we leap ahead of the rest of the world not joke we became among the best educated countries in the world but somewhere along the way we stopped investing in ourselves america is still the largest economy in the world we still have the most productive workers in the world and most innovative minds but we risk losing our edges in nation our infrastructure used to be the best in the world not joke the best in the world today according to the world economic forum we ranked th in the world in terms of infrastructure our roads bridges highways internet the whole works th in the world we used to lead the world in educational achievement today the organization for economic cooperation and development in europe ranks america out of major companies when it comes to investing in early childhood education and talk about an equalizer the greatest equalizer in the world the great universities has done studies the last years you give kid no matter what the kid background from broken home from home where mom or dad didn go to school whatever and you put them in school in third grade school not daycare you increase by the chance that they ll complete years of school and build confidence what education all about it about building confidence in child it about giving the tools to do something we can be competitive in the st century economy if we continue to slide the way we have that why resolve that we have to once again build america from the bottom up and the middle out again not the top down and by the way capitalist think if you can be millionaire billionaire fine just do your fair share just do your fair share trickle down economics has always failed it hadn built this country you know who built this country like the young man who just introduced me union people people who in fact can make decent hard wage build the country it not hyperbole mean it from the bottom of my heart that why proposed two critical pieces of legislation that are being debated back in washington now there some really smart national press with me today and they have understandably believed that there no possibility of my getting this done this has been declared dead on arrival from the moment introduced it but think we re going to surprise them because think people are began in to figure out what at stake you know when use the phrase build back better it being used internationally now got the the largest countries in the world to agree that we re going to have build back better world and we re going to invest and we re going to build around the world the democracies and ability so the rest of the countries don fall prey to those like the belt and road initiative out of china and other initiatives where there ll do something for you if you give me if you give me folks look these bills are not about left versus right or about moderate versus progressive or anything that pits one american against another these bills are about competitiveness versus complacency they re about expanding opportunity not having opportunity denied they re about leading the world and continue to let world or let it pass us by and by the way they will not increase one single penny of the deficit they are fully paid for and all wall street points out they will grow employment by tens of thousands of people tens of thousands of people nobel laureates in the economy sent me letter three weeks ago saying it will also reduce not increase inflation and here what these initiatives are all about first the infrastructure bill when say infrastructure back home people look like infrastructure what hell you talking about joe they know infrastructure generically but it about rebuilding the arteries of our economy that what it about across this country right now there are bridges according to society of engineers significant portion of their ready to fall fall fall and to the water or into the gap that they cover there are miles of roads in poor conditions that have to be built up including more than bridges and over miles of highways here in the state of pennsylvania that need to be repaired and built increase timing in commerce we re going to put hard working americans on the job to bring our infrastructure up to speed good union jobs not an hour or an hour but prevailing wage wage you can raise your family on you can look at your family with pride jobs that can be outsourced jobs replacing lead water pipes like you have here in the scranton area kids getting brain damage because of the ingestion of lead clean water all across america we re going to replace every single lead pipe in the nation again creating jobs but doing more than that increasing the health and wellbeing of our children schools are in position where they ve lead pipes you send your kid to the water fountain you got to wonder about it jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and building modern energy grid folks we re in situation now where you see what happening ve flown all over this country since becoming in you realize more of our land has been burned to the ground burned to the ground in the west and the northwest than the entire state of new jersey every single square mile in new jersey more has been burned down this year this year in the west because of climate change and because of electric utilities failing wires falling we know if we can put these wires underground we increase exponentially the service but it costs lot of money we have to do it we know that we in fact allow people to be able to store we have this incredible energy ve visited one of the largest solar fields in america it in the southwest guess what you can transmit all that energy enough to really light up half of the state of nevada but guess what how do you transmit it what lines do you put it over do we have the capacity to do that we have the engineering capacity but do we have the will to do it and imagine what that does do you realize we had billion and lost this calendar year because of natural disasters billion jobs making sure there high speed internet affordable and available anywhere everywhere in america including for nearly one in six families who go without internet you saw what happened when we ve had this covid try teaching from home how many people do you see out in mcdonald parking lots with their kids in their cars because they get access to the internet to be able to help the kid in school what are we doing this is the united states of america damn it what are we doing and both these bills are going to help us meet the moment on the climate crisis in way that creates good jobs makes us more economically competitive billion in passenger rail and freight rail why do always talk about passenger rail and particularly high speed rail do you realize that chinese are now building another high speed rail line that will go up to miles per hour and you say what difference does that make biden well guess what if you can get in the train and go from here to washington much faster than go on an automobile you take train you take the train we will take literally millions of automobiles off the road off the road saving tens of millions of barrels of oil dealing with cleaning up the air this is not hyperbole this is fact these are facts right now when went out to silicon valley they showed we re in situation where if you put solar panels on your roof guess what when the sun not shining you re in trouble except they have now battery technology you can have batteries in your basement about the size of the width of this so you can have batteries in your basement about the size of the width of this podium and about that thick that keep you going for seven days so what do we have in this legislation we have billion to modernize american transit remember riding the trolley lived at the end of the line as they say in green ridge three blocks at the end of the line beyond the end of the line we dumped but maloney field was on the right and the little league baseball field played in was down the bottom of the hill but the point is it made to work most people live in cities you know the vast majority of people now working people live in cities their jobs are out of town no longer in town no longer in town but do not own an automobile they live in black or hispanic neighborhood or poor neighborhood and all the time they waste trying to get to work look more than billion to build out the national network of electric vehicle charging stations the way my grandpop got up here my grandpop biden who died at mercy hospital of an aneurysm when he was years old two months before was born in mercy hospital he was with the american oil company he was up here opening up gas stations that how he got here this was late well guess what the same thing happens we build these charging stations what happens communities build up around them you get everything from the figurative mcdonald or the dunkin donuts to the drugstore and billion for environmental cleanup and remediation look it means putting people to work in good job for prevailing wages capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells in southeastern pennsylvania and in ohio get the same salary that you paid the mine worker to dig the well they ve got to be kept we have thousands of them need to be kept in addition to that we have methane leaks that are all over and you all understand in pennsylvania about that but guess what increases the health of the community and provides good paying jobs my plan also makes historic investment in clean energy including tax credit for people that do things like winterize their homes install solar panels develop clean energy products help businesses produce more clean energy it real promise you won be around to see it but promise you your kids are going to see time when they re not in fact generating any energy from the homes here in scranton other than renewable energy not joke and by the way one of the things that the president put me in charge of want to be clear here president obama put me in charge of when was vice president was able to invest in that legislation that we put together put together we brought down the price of solar and wind cheaper than coal and cheaper than oil on btu basis it cheaper coal built this town in this part of the country but we ve got to provide other avenues for people to make the same kind of living they used to be able to make look all told just said this project is going to save literally hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually but folks here in pennsylvania know the cost of inaction when it comes to climate change extreme weather has cost this state billion over the last decade and nationally as said extreme other conditions cost billion last year and flew over all of his territory in helicopter in marine one not joke see it see reservoirs that are down feet concerned about the colorado river whether or not we re going to be able to keep things moving not joke it real this is serious stuff and so it not going to ease up on its own we have to invest in our resilience building roads higher when say build back better we re the only country in the world historically that gone through crisis and has come out at the other end better than before the crisis hit that who we are as americans not joke think about it from those of you who teach history think about it we come out better than it was before because we don give up we invest we trust our instincts so that what talking about you know we need more stronger levees stronger power grids more durable able to withstand ever increasing ferocity and intensity of extreme weather any road it used to be you have catastrophe and the road gets washed out you build it back to what it was before you can build it back to the same standard you ve got to build the road back literally higher not joke because the weather has already changed and if we don do something before we reach degrees celsius we re in trouble look we haven passed major infrastructure bill for decades in this country in the last four years you hear every month is infrastructure month didn do single damn thing nothing mean nothing for four years we can afford to sit while other countries pass us by we re going to breathe new life into the economy and our workforce and here the deal these jobs that we are going to create for people who are too often left out and left behind the vast majority of the jobs in my infrastructure bill don require four year degree don require four year degree guess what though it the ultimate blue collar blue collar middle class renewal real serious work that needs to get done folks it isn enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure we also have to invest in our people which we always did we invested in our people that why the second bill is the so called build back better plan and here what it does it takes education as said when american made years of public education standard century go it gave us the best educated best prepared workforce in the world and you saw what happened think about what happened after world war and how america moved because we were the best educated overall country in the world and we led in the th century but as said earlier we know that years is not enough any longer to compete in the st century study after study shows that earlier our children began to learn the better for themselves their families and for the nation you know you all know the statistics and some of your teachers and your husband used to talk to me about this and it was really basic that if you come from home where the mom or dad have books on the shelf and on the coffee table and read and you come from home where mom or dad can read or has th grade education or has little difficulty the child coming from middle class home is going to have heard million more words spoken not different words spoken spoken than the child coming from middle class home and that because look what do you all do you all know with your children and grandchildren you start talking to them when they re in the cradle you engage them they re the people who sit at the dinner table and still talk they re engaged so many homes mothers or fathers don have the capacity or inclination to do that but right now what are we doing we re lagging behind today only about half of the three and four year olds in america are enrolled in early education at all germany france the uk latvia their numbers over of the children it not just early education according to one study we ranked th among advanced economies when it comes to percentage of our young people who have attained any sort of post high school degree ranked th in the world the build back better plan gets us back on track we ll make two years of high quality preschool available to every child in america every child we make investments in education beyond high school that includes increasing pell grants which nearly students in pennsylvania from low income families rely on to attend college we re going to increase it by up to so it becomes the bill invests in our workforce providing much needed breathing room for families remember we moved to wilmington we finally were able after four years dad could buy house and we lived in development it was lovely area in suburban area but it was three bedroom split level home and we had four kids and my grandpop who lived with us or another relative for all those years we lived there didn have headboard but my bed was up against the wall my dad and mom bed was up against the wall look back it was great for us having grandpop and relatives there don know how my parents quite did it but remember one night serious was in high school and could see could feel my dad was restless he would move and could hear it in bed and asked the next morning and asked my mom it true story said what the matter with dad ma he said he got bad news honey his company just said they re no longer going to pay for health insurance well guess what my dad just said everybody entitled all we re looking for is just little breathing room just little bit of extra room little breathing room how can we compete in the world of millions of american parents especially moms who can join the workforce because they can afford the cost of childcare or elder care or they have to stay home heard my colleagues speaking before did here in pennsylvania the average annual cost of childcare for your toddler is it higher in other places so the average two parent family with two young kids spends of their income for childcare every year was single dad for five years got elected to the senate got phone call before got sworn in when was hiring staff saying my wife and daughter had just been killed and my two boys were seriously injured they were hospitalized for long time so that why eventually started commuting but continued to commute because could no more afford and was making lot of money then now granted was listed for years the poorest man in congress but was making year didn think my job was to make money when was in congress but this is not joke could no more for childcare than fly but fortunately had hell of family those values talked about my sister and her husband after little bit they gave up their home came home one night and they moved into my home helped me raise my kids five years later no man deserves one great love let alone two five years later when met and married jill came home after the wedding they had moved out my brother jimmy my best friend my mother they all helped me take care of my kids couldn have done it so understand how in god name do people make it if you look at the world of advanced economics those with advanced economies in each of those countries they invest an average of per year in state sponsored child toddler care american invests times less than our competitors here what it does to our economy you all know it years ago we ranked th in the world among advanced economies and the share of women in the workforce today in america we ranked rd and women are becoming not joke better educated than men if you look at and do about five college commencements year for those five the valedictorian out of those classes for the last years has been woman if you read the data now we re worried about the number of men attending college once again our competitors investing we re standing still my build back better plan is designed to get us moving again look it going to cut the cost of childcare for most pennsylvania families in half no middle income family will pay more than of their income on childcare under my proposal it going to help more people get back to work in the workforce and make ends meet it also going to extend the historic middle class tax cut for parents everybody talks about and by the way going to say something self serving but got on pretty well in the senate for all those years lot of republican friends as well as democratic friends for real kind of like bobby mean they re friends we used to travel together lot and here the deal though you know what was able to do when we passed the american rescue plan in the first month of my administration which has allowed us to have all the funding for covid and when started off there were two million people in america that had gotten vaccine well guess what we re up to million that how we got paid for but here the deal what it meant was what it meant was that right now there whole new attitude that out there how do we not invest so in that act that we passed we provided for child tax credit and you heard my introducer speak to it because we were in such dire straits speak to it because we re in such dire straits we are able to put in position tax cut for middle class people that what it is no one has tax cut we want to cut the capital gains tax for the wealthy or anybody no one has problem when we deal with that we have over corporations america the fortune don pay single solitary penny in taxes not one cent not one cent and make billion year but when you talk about tax cut for middle class people and that exactly what it is by what we did increasing or making refundable tax cut the way it works now if you re made enough money to owe more than in taxes and you had two kids you got to deduct it and here the deal the fact of the matter is that if you didn make that kind of money you didn get the benefit at all it wasn refundable you didn get the benefit at all of the tax cut because if you didn have more than in taxes you still paid and it wasn refundable you didn get it back well here the way we work it we said all right for temporarily we re going to do is make sure there childcare tax credit if you had one kid under seven you get year and if you have one over seven to you get year we upped from well guess what it cut child poverty in pennsylvania by in the nation by it flat out tax cut for ordinary people that what it does make no apologies for it but look folks there so many things that we can do to change the way in which we work all of this and realizing going on here but the fact is there so much at stake so much at stake look the fact is that most of all what it does is we have sandwich generation that exists and many of you are part of that generation you have mom or dad needs some help that you get older and you have child that needs some help if you re going to be able to be in the workforce and it hard to hell hard as hell to make it work you got to give these folks little bit of breathing room the single greatest champion for elder care in the united states of america is this guy right here bobby casey not joke not joke the way it works right now if you qualify for medicaid you have to have lower income to qualify for medicaid not medicare medicaid there are seniors people with disabilities who are on medicaid on waiting list to get home care which they re entitled to how many families are living this story your parents get older they need some help getting around the house making the meals for themselves don want to put them in nursing homes not only because of the cost but because of matter of dignity they do better they live longer if they can stay in their own home but you also don have the time or the money to take care of them at home to do it so you re just looking for an answer so your parents can keep living independently hold here second one of the things that is important think about this in order to get into that nursing home you got to sell everything you have you can have any private property you have to empty your bank account you have to do it all to move in nursing home not saying nursing homes aren valuable they are they re extremely valuable but that not where remember my uncle was moved in with his wife into assisted living center and the folks who had built the facility it was lovely facility in delaware asked if come and speak on the opening of it we re walking out and said mom isn this beautiful she looked at me she was then years old she said this is for old people joey not for me but think about it for millions of families this is the most important issue they re facing it personal it personal and bob casey gets it when bobby fights for something he never gives up in case you haven noticed so here what we re going to do we re going to expand services for seniors so families can get help with well trained well paid professionals to help them take care of their parents at home to cook meal for them to get them their groceries when they need to get groceries to help them get around to just put in railings on their home when my mom lived with me she moved in with me we finally talked her into doing it and guess what my sister takes her up you remember this gene remembers this talking about this too she takes her up to get her prescriptions drives her back gets out of the house it was this little home off of our home she wouldn move in physically move into the house even though we had done the whole thing over for her and she just standing there and moves and breaks her hip she didn trip or anything broke her hip well guess what just having railing just having place where she could walk from one room to the other and to help them in their own home with the dignity they deserve quite frankly what we found is that this is more popular than anything else proposing when you do this individual polling data this is extremely popular because we all feel that obligation to our parents and we want them to live with dignity but because american people understand the need it matter of dignity it matter of pride look that what both these initiatives are all about frankly they re about more than giving working families break they re about position in our country to compete in the long haul economists left right and center agree early this year the wall street outfit moody projected that the investments talking about will create for the next years on average two million additional jobs per year good paying jobs it transformative and we can make these transformation investments and be fiscally responsible take the infrastructure bill all those investments road bridges high speed rail internet the whole deal they represent less than one half of of our economic growth each year less than one half of the cost of the billback better bill in terms of adding to the deficit is because we re going to pay for it all in addition to that half of it is tax cut it not spending money it tax cut for working class people it about time as said and come from the corporate state of the world not joke more corporations are in register in my state than every other state in the united states combined and represented the state of dupont as used to call it for years not anti business but about just begin pay your fair share look folks under this proposal and under this proposal these proposals talking about guarantee you that no one making under year will see one single penny in tax go up not one in fact the plan cuts taxes from working people by the way if you notice the way you usually pay for infrastructure is by gasoline taxes wouldn allow that because that would tax people making under man of my word not one single penny when you pay if you make less than if there no reason there no reason why someone making million year by the way during all the crisis we ve had with covid there absolute finite number of billionaires they can count up in the tax code you know how much money the billionaires made last year collectively they re not bad guy saying that they made trillion increased their collective income trillion just paying fair share if you are multi millionaire or billionaire you have lower tax rate than family that has teacher and firefighter as percent of taxes you pay lower so said our largest corporations paid zero in income tax billion this needs to change working folks understand that that why that despite the tax and misinformation about my plans are still overwhelmingly supported by the american people they understand that when families have little breathing room america in better spot and they know this is about dignity and respect about building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down as said name time in american history when the middle class is done well the wealthy haven done very well name me time so let me close with this for too long working people of this nation the middle class of this country the backbone of the country have been dealt out it time to deal them back in ran for president ran for president saying it time to rebuild the backbone of the nation and by that was very precise the middle class has been the backbone of this nation couldn have been any clearer that why wrote both these bills in the first place and took them to the people campaigned on them the american people spoke they have no doubt about what ran on both these bills were all what talked about but guess what million people voted for me more people voted than any time in american history and their voices deserve to be heard not you denied or worse be ignored because here what know if we make the investments there going to be no stopping america the remainder of the st century ve long said and mean this to every world leader ve known and ve now spoken to over of them and ve known many of them before that tell them it never ever ever been good bet to bet against america no never never never which means it always good bet to bet on america that what these initiatives do they bet on america it about leaving in american people about believing about believing just look at the history of the journey of this nation what becomes clear is this given half chance half chance the american people have never ever ever ever ever ever let the country down just fighting chance no guarantees just chance and that what this is all about and it does not increase the debt when you talk about the number we shouldn even talk

our fallen heroes it particularly appropriate today is here at nine months ago your brothers and sisters thwarted an unconstitutional fundamentally un american attack on our nation values and our votes but because of you democracy survived but only because of the women and men of the us capitol police force washington dc metropolitan police department other law enforcement agency who once again literally put their bodies on the line to protect our democracy that why have no hesitation had none at all in awarding the congressional gold medal of congress the highest expression of our nation appreciation to the us capitol police and washington dc metropolitan police and other responding law enforcement agencies because of these men and women we averted catastrophe but their heroism

enforcement on record and today we re here to remember nearly of your brothers and sisters husbands and wives sons and daughters and we lost so much attended this memorial service many times as said to pay my respects sometimes ve been the speaker other times ve sat on the stage and just thought about all of you sitting on the lawn although this year don know any of the personally who have fallen any of the individuals ve gone through all the names feel know them without having ever met them you see grew up in neighborhood the neighborhood in scranton pennsylvania claymont delaware and bellefonte where grew up with the guys and women that were honoring today one of my best friends in grade school eddie hill became the superintendent of delaware state police great friend and competitor in the other major high school we played ball against one another charlie daugherty became the head of the chief of the wilmington police force and so many more so although didn know them personally know you know you always joked that grew up in places where either became cop firefighter or priest wasn qualified for any of them so had to settle us but all kidding aside over the years as chairman of the judiciary committee ve got to know you even as kids we could see in the women and men around us who the ones who had the heart they were the ones who ran in to help you when everyone else was running away they ran toward inaudible even when they re in grade school knowing they be able to help little bit even if they were outnumbered and not making this up think about it think about your son your daughter your husband your wife who they were and what was inside them it was about service to protect defend this isn just what law enforcement does it who you are it what makes you who you are and when you put on that shield in the morning and walk out the door each day every family member dreads the possibility of receiving that phone call was talking to steny about this just as our son bo was in kosovo for about six months and in iraq for year he was the chief law enforcement officer for the state of delaware the attorney general watch every morning because she left for school before got on the train jill standing there mouthing prayer as she drank cup of coffee over the sink praying praying for bo well you do it every day you did it every day there was line from an english poet john milton he said they also serve who only stand and wait how long have you had to stand and wait and wonder when you heard something on the news or saw it on television thousands and thousands of american families stand and wait so their husband their wives their fathers their mothers sons and daughters can serve the rest of us we not only owe them we owe you it not hyperbole mean this from the bottom of my heart we owe you we ll need to support them and too many of you sitting out there have received that terrible call that your loved one won be coming home at the end of his or her shift to the mothers and fathers are here today my heart aches for you believe it or not jill and understand we got one of those calls in different circumstance no parent should have to bury child lost baby daughter in an accident lost brave son to cancer after coming home from year in iraq but you know what what you ve gone through his hard the fact that he was the chief law enforcement officer of delaware he wasn out there literally he go on patrols but he wasn out there walking up those stairs to make that arrest or try to stop that fight he was always about family it like losing piece of your soul some of you still have that feeling like you ve been sucked into black hole in your chest wondering my god will it ever change sergeant mcclain from detroit decorated for exemplary service during his year career he turned down promotions so he could continue to work as mentor to other officers in his district every two weeks he send his wife flowers at work like clockwork to brighten her day and her office he was killed responding to domestic violence call officer tiffany victoria enrique from honolulu she was one of two officers killed by responding to call was the first female officer to die in the line of duty in the honolulu police department her boyfriend also an officer called her the most hardworking amazing fiercest officer ve ever known my heart is shattered and she was my love my rock my strength so many officer charles excuse me brazilda passed away in but he was recognized in this line of duty this year unit the port authority of new york and new jersey unit trained to perform technical rescue operations after the terrorist attack on september th he was assigned to search and recovery efforts in the world trade tower he like so many others contracted cancer he died of cancer following that assignment he made friends wherever he went he loved the outdoors he was his neighborhood go to guy organizing almost anything including and hunting expeditions as you call the roll today we re acutely aware that behind each name are families that said we know from personal experience that every time there ceremony memorial honoring your lost husband or wife son or daughter it can summon that pride but also that terrible feeling as if you re just hearing the news for the first time so want you to know know although you look forward to honoring your family member it hard it hard mean this sincerely jill and admire your courage for just being here we hope you take some comfort in the knowledge that the men and women here assembled today they ll always be with you not joke they ll always be with you wherever you are even if you don know them in city town place you ve never been before as much as we hope not there re going to be more names added to this roll call of bravery and sorrow there already have been as was preparing these remarks early this morning in houston one deputy killed and two wounded chief finner from houston is here today don know where the chief is but he here today told known him seven houston police officers in his department were killed in the line of duty since chief here for you pal so is everybody else we mourn the fallen we pray for the recovery of the wounded as said ve spoken too many times too many funerals for police officers too many funerals for brave servants who kept us safe so under the mournful sound of the bagpipes we must also hear something else call to do better to do more to keep you safe to keep our communities safer for us to step up build trust and respect and heal the breach we now see in so many communities to recognize that the promise of equal and impartial justice remains promise but not always reality for you or others particularly in low income communities too many communities black and brown too many families are grieving unnecessary losses of their sons their daughters their fathers their brothers want to acknowledge the fop as was mentioned earlier for sincerely trying to reach an agreement on meaningful reforms congressional reforms and the negotiations over the george floyd and policing act but here the part lot of the help has to come to police departments they need help to do better want to thank you for being constructive player in this process we haven gotten there yet but we must get there look there too much pain there too much loss there too much at stake for the safety and for the safety of those you serve it hard time to be police officer in america so want to make sure you have the tools to be the partners and the protectors your communities need that when you look at what your communities need and what you re being asked to do there are going to be more resources not fewer resources help you do your job that why propose we invest again in community policing we know it works one thing that protects cops is another cop and the training you and the community have requested the community based programs and interventions that can stop violence before it starts provide specific guidance explaining the communities can and should use funds from the american rescue plan billion in aid to city states counties tribes to hire and retain officers many cities from albuquerque to st paul are doing just that and proposed an additional million in my budget to support community policing across the country it hard when you don know the community and the most important way to get to know them has more police we re also investing in community violence intervention programs which are proven have proven track record of reducing violence for up to in cities across the nation at the same time we have to stop asking law enforcement officers to do every single job under the sun committed to investing in mental health services mental health professionals who can respond to mental health crises alongside you you shouldn be the one having to talk someone off the edge of the roof you should have professional help with you supporting our law enforcement officers requires that we invest in systems that provide adequate healthcare counseling drug treatment prevention housing education and other social services in the community so there is not the discord we need to work together to confront the epidemic of gun violence your brothers and sisters have told me over the years sometimes you feel like you re outgunned right now the justice department of the leadership and attorney general garland is working with state and local law enforcement across the country to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals they now have zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate the law putting firearms in the hands of people who are danger to the community and you also want to make it easier for states to adopt red flag laws laws that allow have family members or law enforcement to petition court order to temporarily remove firearms from people who are in crisis representing the danger to themselves and to others by the way more people die of gunshot wounds in america as consequence of suicide than any other reason ve called on congress to reauthorize the violence against women act and to close the domestic violence loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers of all calls that result in an officer death were domestic violence related these steps will protect you protect the people you serve and finally and tragically in the past two years covid has caused more deaths in the line of duty than all the other causes combined many of those lost their lives keeping our society safe serving on the front lines in those dark early days of the pandemic but now let us prevent the preventable tragedies the last time stood here was to take the oath of office as your president said that day we have much to repair much to restore much to heal much to build much to gain it remains true believe with all my heart there nothing you re unable to do if we equip you that we can unite this nation and fight our common foes anger resentment hatred extremism racism lawlessness violence disease joblessness hopelessness we have never ever failed in america when we ve acted together so let act together to support you in the service of the nation we love in closing let me say that know there are no words no memorials that can fill that void that black hole in your chest so many of you feel but promise you the day will come when the memory of your loved one will bring smile to your lips before it brings tear to your eye that when you know you re going to make it that when you know that will happen but my prayer for you is that that day they will come sooner and later there headstone in cemetery in ireland that reads death leaves heartache no one can heal love leaves memory that no one can steal they re with you they re in your heart they re part of you the souls of those you love and those with whom you serve rest in peace and rising glory in the meantime you re in our prayers may god bless you and may god protect all those who serve us in uniform thank you thank you senator my name is joe biden am jill biden husband delighted to

sons of connecticut senator thomas dodd and my good friend and we truly are really good close friends senator chris dodd chris and have known each other for long time but if you ll excuse the point of personal privileges we used to say in the senate saw up close how he fought for human rights and human dignity in the senate do you know my measure madame ambassador ambassador kenned you know what my measure is people who tell me they care about people and then disrespect waitress or waiter people who tell me they care about how in fact people are entitled to be treated with dignity and walk by someone at shoe side stand and doesn say hello people who do not do the just simply decent things for ordinary people that the real measure ve never seen chris figuratively or speaking walk by anybody ve never seen him nor his wife nor his two brilliant beautiful daughters remember the passion and eloquence that you brought to the floor chris whether you were fighting for american families or serving as the senate leader leading voice on engagement with latin america and the caribbean and your brother the ambassador did pretty good job as well think that the work this senator doing to be bring human rights to the forefront and public understanding is making real and immediate impact for all young people today think it going to rate high among your family many great and lasting contributions to the country chris and know this is truly family commitment for the dodds so thank you for inviting me to be part of this think it really mean it it an honor to be able to be here of course owe chris remember whereas he pointed out when we were both running for president back in with almost no cash in either of our campaigns you let me hop ride with you in twin engine prop plane true story from our senate vote in dc to democratic debate in new hampshire we were on our way to the debate one other time but the whole way up we just laughed and told stories before we were debating one another and then the next day to get back to the senate to vote we had to flag down young you remember this we had to flag down young senator named barack obama to get to inaudible an open airport god truth remember that chris here he just been there two years he was on my foreign relations committee was chairman said can you get the airport open for us used to kid barack couldn understand why he so soundly defeated me in that primary and then realized when he be introduced he be introduced by the voice of god get introduced by johnny scanafrani so it took while for me to figure all this out luckily chris got to travel on much for playing these days and it yours to travel in any time you would like and want to thank few more proud connecticut leaders who ve been spending time with me today governor lamont you ve been you re one of the finest governors in the country not being solicitous exceeded only by your wife the senator blumenthal who mentioned earlier today apologize for repeating this but my son beau biden who the one that should be standing here talking to you my son beau biden was the attorney general of the state of delaware one of the people he went to and sought advice from for real was that attorney general blumenthal they became friends and my son was great admirer and think the senator knows that and senator murphy if have to someone in the foxhole with me want murph with me man no serious this guy knows as much about foreign policy as anybody does and his failure to remain silent has meant great deal to me because he spoken up on so much and representative courtney thank you thank for your help and your support and rosa delauro rosa don owe as much as chris does to rosa but owe hell of lot to her my son he was married and it was his second year of law school and he transferred to yale law school and rosa heard that was coming up with him and the apartment he rented was less than ideal and the whole thing had to be painted my brother jimmy fixes everything my brother jimmy with us and we went down and bought about gallons of paint don know but for real it was hot as hell as well and up on eight foot ladder painting the crown molding and sweating like the proverbial you know what and here the door said come in and the then alderman is it alderman or councilman at the time alderman alderman delauro walked in and her mom and she said where biden said here she no stop fooling with me son where biden said no no biden biden and she came she said just want to come over and introduce myself and tell you your son ll be taken care of and in walks the chief of police thought holy god what did do she said you have nothing to worry about you have nothing to worry about talk about constituent service rosie you come by it honestly and rosa we ve all not being solicitous again using that word twice now we ve all learned great deal from you want to thank you for your long standing dedication relating to the well being of children and families and for championing and expanding the child tax credit which is gigantic middle class tax credit for working families that we finally got passed in the american rescue plan which we were able to get done immediately upon being elected and rosa will not tell you but she the first person called to ask for her help as to how should do this and that put money in the pockets of families all across this country even as we speak it how we re going to cut child poverty in this country and we ve already cut it in nearly in half and none of us should lose sight of what it meant to american families when we think about our mission to defend human rights and dignity at home and around the world years ago today another united states senator united states president who just spoke to chris literally an hour and half ago bill clinton he sends his best by the way visited this university to dedicate the thomas dodd research center library and archives of papers that amount to incredible first person first draft of history and let me say they re all thinking about president clinton today as his sending him his good wishes of speed of recovery he always been comeback kid he getting out of the hospital he always been comeback kid he getting out of the hospital mean he been going well but he wanted to send his best as young lawyer tom dodd had already built record of fighting hatred by prosecuting the kkk in the south but when in he left behind his beloved grace and this five young children young christopher just months old at the time to travel to the bombed out cities of europe to document the shocking atrocities still fresh in their horror to question and cross examine some of history most notorious villains that not hyperbole some of history most notorious villains and to expose beyond question the depravity and the crimes against humanity that the nazi regime committed tom dodd dedicated his intellect and his moral passion and his resolute sense of right and wrong to making the nuremberg war crimes trial testament to justice and that what it was testament to justice nothing like it ever happened before and all while he was writing letters to his grace lamenting their separation but recognizing the momentous weight of history that rested on his shoulders and chris came up the same sentence from your book someday he wrote it will be recognized as great landmark in the struggle of mankind for peace never before has such record been written and men will read it for years in amazement and wonder how it ever happened when president clinton spoke at this first dedication he ended on pointed reminder he said and quote the road to tyranny we must never forget begins with the destruction of truth the rise to tyranny begins with the destruction of truth in my view that was the lesson at the heart of the nuremberg trials finding truth documenting it so it could never be denied in court tom dodd build case fact by fact using the nazis own meticulous records of crimes and shocking human evidence to pin down nazi leaders who tried to deny their complicity and feign ignorance and even more important it denied the entire german policy the ability to feign ignorance to deal with the past you must face the truth whether it dachau inaudible auschwitz or other camps millions of jews rounded up along with members of other minority groups thrown into camps abused used as forced labor medical experimentation six million jews murdered including so many who met their ultimate faith in the gas chamber he made sure no one could deny their own eyes and what they saw he preserved the truth ugly and as traumatic as it was for all of history so that the horrors of the holocaust could never be diminished or denied and evil that we still have to guard against to this day has to be watched chris as you heard me say many times before because you got to meet my dad my dad was well read high school educated fellow who greatest regret was he never went to college but he cared deeply about human dignity at our dinner table our dad was what many would call righteous christian he happened to be catholic but he was righteous christian and growing up my dad would come home for dinner before he went back to close the business he managed and the dinner table was place where we sat down to have conversation and incidentally eat serious my dad used to talk about as student of the holocaust what tragedy it was that we didn bomb the railroad tracks toward the end of the war how wrong it was that we turned away the st louis ship full of jewish refugees from europe he believed passionately the only way we could make real the promise of never again was to keep reminding ourselves of what had happened and how so many people otherwise thought themselves decent people rationalized that it really wasn happening we didn know what was going on because they weren turning on the gas valve they had no responsibility that why if you ll again excuse the point of personal privilege when each of my children and now my grandchildren turn the age of the first thing ve done my word as biden is put them on an aircraft and fly to dachau one at time at age work sets you free as you go through the entrance but that not what wanted them to see wanted them to see the lovely homes that were right up against the fence line with their beautiful roofs people living in there rationalized that it not me not doing this and don know really what going on in there wanted them to see the ability of human mind to rationalize cannot be underestimated would say parenthetically the reason why germany has been able to turn it around unlike other countries is because they faced it head on acknowledged so let me say it again nuremberg was unlike anything that ever came before it was not about vengeance it was about accountability only by acknowledging the truth can we prevent the repetition of atrocities which are happening now in other parts of the world it elevated our conception as chris said of the rule of law it set marker for the future of justice it uplifted the importance of human rights in international affairs we see it in the nuremberg tribunals the blueprint we see in those tribunals the blueprint for future united nations tribunals that would help deliver justice after atrocities committed in rwanda and the former yugoslavia we see it in the values championed at nuremberg in the antecedents of the universal declaration of human rights and the foundation of rules based international order built out of the records of two wars world wars not just to prevent us from destroying ourselves but to actively build better future we see in the passion of young prosecutor commitment is prioritizing the human impacts of policies commitment carried through in his son career of public commitment carried through in his son career of public service by all the students of this institute been inspired by the example we need you we need you badly and as we look around the world today we see human rights and democratic principles increasingly under assault we feel the same charge of history upon our own shoulders to act we have fewer democracies in the world today than we did years ago fewer not more fewer cannot be sustained that why from day one of my administration ve taken concrete steps to put human rights back at the center of our foreign policy and reassert our moral leadership on the global stage to lead as chris has so often heard me say with the power of our example not the example of our power chris and ve served in the foreign relations committee we excoriated abuses elsewhere in the world and call for action overseas human rights in some ways stood apart from the domestic struggle of civil rights and civil liberties and equal justice here at home today we know that our efforts to defend human rights around the world are stronger because we recognize our own historic challenges as part of that same fight leading by example means taking action at home to renew and defend our own democracy to advance equity and promote justice to defend the sacred right to vote in free fair and secure elections leading by example means not pretending our history has been perfect but demonstrating how strong nations speak honestly about the past and uphold the truth strive to improve we make the best case for gender equality racial justice and equity religious freedom the rights of the lgbtq plus peoples and other marginalized communities around the world by practicing what we preach first minutes was office ended the muslim ban advancing racial equity through the federal government overturning the ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the united states military establishing the white house gender policy council demonstrating that our commitment human rights begins at home is among the most powerful and persuasive tools in our foreign policy kit and as we defend human rights beyond our shores they re more effective when we work together allies and partners in our shared values america as nation is unique in all history not because we re inherently better because the basis upon which we are organized virtually every ever nation is organized based on ethnicity religion geography color we re unique in all the world we re based on one guiding principle we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights including life liberty and the pursuit of happiness we have never lived up to it we have never until very recently walked away from it arc has always bent closer and closer to justice and inclusion the moment we stopped the moment we rest is the moment that our influence diminishes so we re reengaging multilaterally and rallying the world to advance university human rights and fundamental freedoms to prove that democracies can still deliver in an age of fast moving cross cutting challenges we have rejoined the un human rights council which we walked away from the united states of america didn want to be part mean just yesterday we won an election it new three year term that begins in january inaudible we had to fight to get back on it because the world wondered do we mean it still united states of america do we mean it in december the united states will host virtual summit summit of democracies to bring together world leaders to make concrete commitments to defend democratic values and push back against advancing authoritarianism not war but important words you can return to world where might is right and strong nations abuse weak or oppress individual rights to impunity nuremberg forced us look closely at the evil of humankind and what we re capable of perpetrating to see mass atrocities crimes against humanity do not happen by accident they don happen by accident there is only choices choices made by individual human beings and world leaders and sadly when we look around the world today we cannot say that the specter of atrocity is behind us we see today the patterns the choices playing out around the world even as we speak the oppression and use of forced labor for the uyghurs in xinjiang treatment the rohingya by the military inaudible in burma the rampant abuses including the use of starvation and sexual violence to terrorize civilian populations in northern ethiopia whenever we hear that kind of poisonous hatred where we ever we see our fellow human beings being dehumanized doesn mean go to war but we must speak out silence as my dad would remind me silence is complicity silence is complicity that what nuremberg said your silence is complicity ve raised these issues personally with leaders around the world our friends and adversaries alike and made it clear that no us president should stand by when human rights are under attack and maintain their legitimacy those who we are that who we are as americans it part of our dna we fought we marched we sacrificed to ensure the rights are not reserved to just the wealthy or the powerful they re god given inheritance of every person on this planet by virtue of our shared humanity as said to the supreme court justice who disagreed with in the hearing we have different you think have my rights because the constitution granted to me possess my rights because was born and gave up some of my rights in the constitution that the radical idea at the core of the founding of our that the radical idea at the core of the founding of our nation as said that all men and women are created equal we really are endowed by creator with certain unalienable rights and those rights don flow from the power of the government these rights exist for every individual period it the job of government to protect them to uphold them equally for all people we ve never as ve said fully lived up to that animated american ideal but we ve never turned our backs on it in all the years since our founding that idea has been our nation steady north star drawing us back on course constant struggle to live up to our highest domestic democratic principles to self correct has made us beacon of hope for the rest of the world it also made us strong resilient innovative dynamic as said repeat apologize america the only nation founded of an idea the single most powerful idea in human history it sparked our revolution that helped ignite the wave of change around the world the success of generations that built on it expanding our understanding and extending protections to an ever wider circle we must never forget just how fragile the principle of universal human rights still is how easily bruised often sacrificed in human battles for power and personal enrichment in an age of increasing misinformation and disinformation we must not grow complacent in our defense of the democratic values would have been the firm foundation for an era of peace and prosperity unprecedented in human history tax on truth are still the harbinger of tyranny nothing about our democracy is assured as sure you ve all become to realize lately nothing about our freedom is guaranteed we have to work for it and those letters from tom dodd to his dear wife grace reflecting his service at nuremberg he wrote sometimes man knows his duty so clearly so surely he cannot hesitate and he dare not refuse it tom dodd lived life with clarity of purpose he brought it to his service as senator leading the floor fights with the kennedys on civil rights legislation in the advocating for gun safety in state that was major gun manufacturer legislation that was ahead of its time fighting always for human rights and democracy against the forces of oppression and injustice he passed that passion onto his children and through his son chris carried forward his father mantel in the united states senate he uses it to fight for all american children and families passing the first childcare act we ve seen this country since world war two passing the family medical leave act chris rallied against policies that militarized the relationships in latin america and argued instead to recognize and invest in the people in our hemisphere he spoke out when he saw the legacy of justice that his father had fought for in nuremberg being wrapped in the excesses of war on terror and he helped to create this center growing it over the years from an archival repository for the truth into leading center for the study and promotion of human rights at home and abroad into widely respected academic institution training the next generation of human rights defenders and passing the torch to those of you who will carry the fight on into the future for the truth so as we rededicate the dodd center for human rights to honor the legacies of both father and son let also dedicate it to the future of generations to the students here in the audience today who discover and defend human rights is the passion and purpose of our life so let us be dedicated to expanding our shared understanding that we can never fully realize the freedom we wish for ourselves but also helping ensure that liberty and justice for everyone and let dedicate it the unending fight to bring our own nation our own world closer to future in which every human being is free to pursue the highest dreams and unleash their full potential and for you students that are here undergraduates at this great institution there no reason why you will not be doing what doing as president of the united states standing here speaking to audiences to now mean that from the bottom of my heart was taught came from very modest means no inaudible story but very modest means that you can be anything you set your mind to if you work at it so many of you in this audience especially in the second tier there are the people that my grandchildren will be looking to there not single reason why not single reason why we can do this not single reason as ve told every world leader that ve gotten to know and ve met many many of them it never been good bet to bet against the american people god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you good afternoon ve just been briefed by my covid team on the progress we re making on our fight against the virus today want to provide brief update on my plan announced in early september to accelerate the path out of this pandemic it working we re making progress nationally daily cases are down hospitalizations are down over the past six weeks over the past two weeks most of the country has improved as well case rates are declining in states and hospital rates are declining in states we re down to million still unacceptably high number of unvaccinated people from almost million in july that important it important progress but now not the time to let up we have lot more to do we re in very critical period as we work to turn the corner on covid first we have to do more to vaccinate the million unvaccinated people in america it essential the vaccine requirements that we started rolling out in the summer are working they re working the labor department is going to soon be issuing an emergency rule for companies with or more employees to implement vaccination requirements among their workforce every day we see more businesses implementing vaccination requirements and the mounting data shows that they work businesses and organizations that are implementing requirements are seeing their vaccination rates rise by an average of or more to well over the number of employees vaccinated let be clear vaccination requirements should not be another issue that divides us that why we continue to battle the misinformation that out there and companies and communities are stepping up as well to combat the misinformation southwest airlines at the head of the pilot union and its ceo dismissed critics who claim vaccination mandates contributed to flight disruptions school board members religious leaders and doctors across the country are fighting misinformation and educating people about the importance of vaccines all of these efforts are going to help us continue moving the dial to eliminate this disease second we re going to continue protecting the vaccinated this week the food and drug administration and the fda is reviewing data on moderna and johnson and johnson boosters we expect the final decision from the fda and the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc in the next couple of weeks if they authorize the boosters which would be strictly made based on the science that decision will be based on the science this ll mean all three vaccines will be available for boosters already more than one out of three eligible seniors have gotten their third shot the booster and we re going to continue to provide that additional protection to seniors and others as we head into the holidays these boosters are free ll say it again they re free available and convenient to get third point like to make we need to continue to keep our schools and our students safe of school districts are fully open with children back in the classroom and for in person learning we have been able to do this because we provided our schools the resources they need to protect children and the educators as well as the staff that works in the schools we ve been encouraging schools to implement important health measures like masking testing and getting everyone vaccinated who is eligible to be vaccinated now know parents out there are anxiously waiting for vaccine for children ages to the good news is the fda and outside experts from the cdc are set to make this determination as to whether the vaccine will be authorized for that age range in the next few weeks if authorized we are ready we have purchased enough vaccines for all children between the ages of and in the united states and it ll be convenient for parents to get their children vaccinated at trusted locations families will be able to sleep easier at night knowing their kids are protected as well let me close with this the plan laid out in september is working we re headed in the right direction we have critical work to do but we can let up now my team and are doing everything we can but calling on more businesses to step up calling on more parents to get their children vaccinated when they are eligible and asking everyone everyone who hasn gotten vaccinated please get vaccinated that how we put this pandemic behind us and accelerate our economic recovery we can do this ve said many times god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you very much and with the holidays coming up you might be wondering if gifts you planned to buy will arrive on time well let me explain supply chains essentially mean how we make things and how the material and parts get delivered to factory so we can manufacture things and manufacture them here how we move things how finished product moves from factory to store to your home and today we have an important announcement that we ll get things you buy to you to the shelves faster joined by the executive director of the ports of los angeles and long beach gene seroka and mario cordono miss apologize mario and the president of the international longshoremen union willie adams los angeles and long beach are home to two of the largest ports in america and together these ports are among the largest in the world and the best way to make that point is that of shipping containers that we import into this country come through these two ports and today we have some good news we re going to help speed up the delivery of goods all across america after weeks of negotiation and working with my team and with the major union retailers and freight movers the port of los angeles announced today that it going to begin operating hours day seven days week this follows the port of long beach commitment to that it announced just weeks ago system what most of the leading countries in the world already operate on now except us until now this is the first key step toward moving our entire freight transportation and logistical supply chain nationwide to system and here why it matters traditionally our ports have only been open during the week monday through friday and they re generally closed down at nights and on weekends by staying open seven days week through the night and on the weekends the port of los angeles will open over extra hours week will be open in total that will almost double the number of hours that the port is open for business from earlier this year that means an increase in the hours for workers to be moving cargo off ships onto trucks and rail cars to get to their destination and more than that the night hours are critical for increasing the movement of goods because highways are less crowded at night in fact during off peak hours in los angeles cargo leaves the port at faster pace than during the day shift so by increasing the number of late night hours of operation and opening up for less crowded hours when the goods can move faster today announcement has the potential to be game changer say potential because all of these goods won move by themselves for the positive impact to be felt all across the country and by all of you at home we need major retailers who order the goods and the freight movers who take the goods from the ships to factories and to stores to step up as well these private sector companies are the ones that hire the trucks and rail cars and move the goods on this score we have some good news report as well today walmart our nation largest retailer is committing to go all in on moving its products from the ports to their stores nationwide specifically walmart is committing as much as increase in the use of off peak hours over the next several weeks additionally fedex and ups two of our nation biggest freight movers are committing today to significantly increase the amount of goods they re moving at night fedex and ups are the shippers for some of our nation largest stores but they also ship for tens of thousands of small businesses all across america their commitment to go all in on operations means that businesses of all sizes will get their goods on shelves faster and more reliably accordingly according to one estimate together fedex and ups alone move up to of packages in america up to and other companies are stepping up as well they include target home depot and samsung that have all committed to ramp up their activities to utilize off peak hours at the ports so the commitments being made today are sign of major progress in moving goods from manufacturers to store or to your front door want to thank my supply chain disruption taskforce which we set up in june led by secretary buttigieg raimondo and vilsack and my director of national economic council brian deese want to thank them for their leadership and especially want to thank joe porcari and think joe done one heck of job my special envoy specifically on ports who been working this issue with all the stakeholders for the past several weeks also want to thank the port directors want to thank gene and mario again and the mayors of los angeles and long beach mayor garcetti and mayor garcia for their leadership and think the private companies that are stepping up want to thank them but particularly want to thank labor willie adams of the longshoreman and warehouses union who is here today the teamsters the rail unions from the brotherhood of railroad signalmen and the international association of machinists to the american train dispatchers association to sheet metal air rail and transportation workers union known as smart want to be clear this is across the board commitment to going to this is big first step in speeding up the movement of materials and goods through our supply chain but now we need the rest of the private sector chain to step up as well this is not called supply chain for nothing this means the terminal operators railways trucking companies shippers and other retailers as well strengthening our supply chain will continue to be my team focus if federal support is needed ll direct all appropriate action and if the private sector doesn step up we re going to call them out and ask them to act because our goal is not only to get through this immediate bottleneck but to address the longstanding weaknesses in our transportation and supply chain that this pandemic has exposed might add parenthetically one of the reasons why think it very important that we get the infrastructure plan passed my infrastructure plan and that supply chain system almost entirely in the hands of private business the world has changed prior to the crisis we chaired the focus on lean efficient supply chains leaving no buffer or margin for error when it comes to certain parts arriving just in time as needed to make final product our administration inaudible that the way it was just in time was the focus we didn have pandemic and other things at the time we need to take longer view though than invest in building greater resilience to withstand the kinds of shocks we ve seen over and over year in and year out whether it the pandemic extreme weather climate change cyber attacks rather disruptions in fact research tells us that company can expect to lose over of one year earnings every years due to supply chain disruptions longer term view means we invest in systems that have more time built in and our ability to produce innovate and partner with our allies that also means companies throughout the supply chain like maritime air freight and trucking companies reduce their carbon emissions and help to meet our climate change goals it also means creating and supporting good paying jobs so folks want to stay in these jobs so they can build the skills and careers and make decent living it means more opportunities to join union especially for truckers these steps are critical they allow companies to pivot quickly when disruption hits because they ve invested in their workers their workers skills and training upfront to be able to adapt we need to invest in making more of our products right here in the united states never again should our country and our economy be unable to make critical products we need because we don have access to materials to make that product never again should we have to rely too heavily on one company or one country or one person in the world particularly when countries don share our values when it comes to labor and environmental standards ve said before we re more in the competition for the st century we are america we still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world but the rest of the world is closing in and we risk losing our edge if we don step up in order to be globally competitive we need to improve our capacity to make things here in america while also moving finished products across the country and around the world we need to think big and bold that why pushing for once in generation investment in our infrastructure and our people with my infrastructure bill and my build back better act these bills will transform our ports there billions of dollars for ports highways rail systems that sorely need upgrading and would bring products faster and more efficiently from the factories to the store to your house let me be clear we re proposing to make the biggest investment in ports in our history the bill would also make investments in our supply chains in manufacturing and strengthening our ability to make more goods from the beginning to end right here in america the bottom line we ve seen the cost of inaction in the pandemic in the delays and the congestion that affect every american but it fully within our capacity to act to make sure it never happens again it going to take little time and that we ve unlocked the full might and dynamism of our economy and our people that what we re going to do god bless you all and may god bless the longshoreman rail workers truckers and all the workers who are keeping our economy going may god protect our troops thank you all so very much good afternoon everyone today for the first time since march of the american unemployment rate is below in just eight months since became president in the midst of great public health and economic crisis the unemployment rate is now down below at let me just repeat that today report has the unemployment rate down to significant improvement from when took office and sign that our recovery is moving forward even in the face of covid pandemic that improvement was widespread unemployment for hispanic workers was down and the unemployment rate for african americans fell almost full percent and it now below for the first time in months drop of in long term unemployment is the second largest single month drop since we started keeping records the largest was in july so in the past three months we ve seen drop of million long term unemployed that the largest three months fall in long term unemployment since we started keeping records of more to do but great progress and working americans are seeing their paychecks go up as well in september we saw one of the largest increases in average wages paid to working americans on record today report comes one day after the labor department found in the third quarter of this year the number of layoffs in job reductions was the lowest in this country since overall the unemployment report shows almost jobs were created last month over in the private sector and in manufacturing offset by some seasonal adjustments in education hiring the monthly total is bounce around but if you take look at the trend it solid on average new jobs created every month since took office and in three months before got there that was one th what was being created as opposed to jobs month in total the job creation in the first eight months of my administration is nearly million jobs jobs up wages up unemployment down that progress and it attributed to the hard work and resilience of the american people for battling through this pandemic working to keep their businesses afloat remember today report is based on survey that was taken during the week of september the th not today september the th when the covid cases were averaging more than per day since then we ve seen the daily cases fall by more than one third and they re continuing to trend down we re continuing to make progress right now things in washington as you all know are awfully noisy turn on the news and every conversation is confrontation every disagreement is crisis but when you take step back and look at what happening we re actually making real progress maybe it doesn seem fast enough like to see it faster and we re going to make it faster but maybe it doesn appear dramatic enough but too would like to as said move it faster we re making consistent steady progress though and thanks to bipartisan agreements we re making progress on funding the government and raising the debt limit so people continue to get their social security checks the military continue to get paid and so much more we re making real progress on covid as well more than million americans are now fully vaccinated more than of eligible americans have gotten at least one shot and covid cases are down in the past month hospitalizations are down over in july when announced the first vaccination requirement about million eligible americans still had not been vaccinated today we ve reduced that from to million eligible americans haven been vaccinated that still much too much there more work to do including getting more people vaccinated but we continue to make progress and the american rescue plan which we passed shortly after was elected we made progress providing rent and mortgage relief to help keep roofs over people heads we provided checks in pockets and other benefits so families can put food on the table for their families hundreds of thousands of loans to help small businesses stay open and keep employees on job getting paid today towns and cities and states that were at risk of losing hundreds of thousands of jobs before because they didn have the budget to pay we help make their payroll for them so they could keep teachers police officers firefighters essential workers on the job helping schools stay open with the equipment and resources needed to keep students and educators safe and we finally gave tax break ve been working at this for long time to families with children which as speak is providing monthly checks for more families for million children per month for every child under the age of seven per month for every child under the age of keeping the tax cut it tax cut for these people and cutting child poverty nearly in half over we re making progress protecting our air and water as well and our natural lands much more to do and ll have more to say about that later today the jobs numbers also remind us that we have important work ahead of us and important investments we need to make america is still the largest economy in the world we still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world but we risk losing our edge as nation if we don move our infrastructure used to be the best in the world today according to the world economic forum the united states of america ranked th in the world th on infrastructure roads bridges ports et cetera we re among the first in the world to guarantee access to universal education back at the turn of the th century now the organization of economic cooperation and development catch this ranks america out of major economies when it comes to investing in early childhood education as percent of gdp our of on all of these investments that fuel strong economy we ve taken our foot off the gas and the world has taken notice including our adversaries and now they re closing the gap look so it essential that we have to regain the momentum we lost as my wife says all the time professor she any country that out educates us is going to out compete us the work of our time is to prepare ourselves for it to be competitive to win the fast changing st century global economy that why proposed two critical pieces of legislation being debated here in washington right now one focus on the investments we need to make in the physical infrastructure of america roads bridges ports et cetera the second focus on the investments that need to make in the american people to make us more competitive know this is my legislation and feel strongly about it but the people who have the most at stake are the american people so we need to stay focused on what these bills will mean to the people who are just looking for little bit of breathing room fair chance to build decent middle class life to succeed and thrive is spending just hanging on by their fingernails we need to keep an eye an eye on what fundamentally at stake for our country the ability to compete and win the race of the st century as we did the th century race that other countries are doing everything they can to win in recent years china has spent around three times as much on infrastructure three times as much as share of its economy than the united states has our infrastructure bill makes investments we need to rebuild the arteries of our economy the roads the highways the bridges the ports the airports the rails and we re going to allow us to replace led water pipes which are poisoning our children and families it ridiculous build modern energy grid that we can withstand storms and carry renewable energy across america make high speed internet affordable and available to everywhere in america and create good union jobs in the process of putting that together we re going to make the largest investment in public transit in american history and we re going to make the most important investments in our rail since their creation of amtrak years ago but isn enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure we re going to lead the world like we used to if we re going to do that we also have to invest in our people that what my second bill does the build back better plan that what it does today only about half of the three and four year olds in america are enrolled in early childhood education in germany france the uk in latvia that number is more than we re falling behind it not just early education according to one study catch this american ranks rd out of the advanced economies when it comes to the percentage of our young people who have attained post high school degree united states rd out of my build back better plan gets us back on track to making four additional years of public education available for every person in america two years of high quality preschool and the front end which indicates that over of the children be able to go through all years and beyond without any interruption and investments in community college so our students can gain the skills they need and carve out place for themselves in the st century economy we re going to help build families we re going to help them afford to care for their new baby child an elderly relative it going to extend the tax credit for families with children it going to help us meet the moment on climate change and become global leader in the fast growing clean energy industries like solar and wind power the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric and battery technology we need to make sure america builds that future instead of falling behind we should build those vehicles and the batteries that go into them and the charging stations that are going to need the we re going to build across america here in the united states we should be doing this and look if we get this done we re going to breathe new life in our economy and our workforce and we re going to breathe cleaner air at the same time these are the kinds of investments that will get america back in the game and give our workers chance fighting chance economists left right and center agree earlier this year moody on wall street projected at the investments in these bills will bring us higher gdp and additional million jobs per year in lower unemployment these bills are not about left versus right or modern versus progressive or anything else that pits americans against one another these bills are about competitiveness versus complacency competitiveness versus complacency opportunity versus decay they re about leading the world or whether we re going to let the world pass us by the american people understand what at stake here they understand that when workers and families have better shot america has better shot give it half chance to american people have never never ever ever let their country down today we receive more evidence of the progress we re making and know we can make lot more in the days ahead want to thank you and god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you very much'"

       "'hello... i heard about free code camp via lifehacker (i think: it was a feedly- feed) so, just going through the prescribed steps (hello world etc.) have a mix of different technologies would like to get into development side of things. looking for some idea on the average amount of time (yes, subjective and varies by level of commitment) day/week/etc. it takes to effectively use curriculum ok, i found the documentation (i\\'m new) on the general timelines things take etc. -have a lot of relational db (so think in terms of tables and keys) -would i have a difficult time with mongodb  (different approach nosql)? at what point does pair coding come into the picture? (am new and also a linux user)?  do some amount of bash here as well. have to sometimes unlearn white space with js with all of the various frameworks (even some being learned in course) being employed (to save time on different things) maybe it leads to a lot things \\'looking the same\\' on different pages. i\\'d like to see more variety in design as well. i think it\\'s part \\'where people expect to see things\\' (e.g., steering wheel in a car) and part standout design aspects does the sameness (not specifically bootstrap, but in general) begin to shape demand/design? i\\'ve found that compiling a list (your own + links to) of stuff helps.  a lot of where i get caught up isn\\'t  the underlying logic but not placing a ; in the right place or remembering some element name syntax that is i find geany to be pretty solid (as far as editors go). ugly, yes. i\\'d imagine if you had experience programming desktop apps, it wouldn\\'t be difficult to apply to diff web technologies edit: too i think (in addition to monospace vs. monotype) you can also put font-size and family in same declaration (i\\'m no expert) good to hear. css is more forgiving than js very true. sloppy code not only affect you, but the person (in production years down the road) affects why do you have to loop through each character vs. \"uppercasing\" the entire string?  oh, i see (not critique, just curious ) i see . @mrxinu - i haven\\'t gotten to that exercise yet the js exercises are a little quirky in the way they progress (i.e., keeping previous result from prev exercise - then asking to do/add something (when a re-write might make more sense) if you\\'re not making mistakes, you\\'re doing something wrong even if i have to use a vm, i find anything with a kde desktop helps workflow (screen edges etc.) no gig is \\'more poverty\\' inducing than gig. get one (gig) then evaluate whether it\\'s too low etc. i see a lot of dollar figures (which of course is important) thrown around, but focus on the content first (learn it (whatever \\'it\\' is ),  otherwise , it\\'s all hypothetical .  there are still a lot of ms shops around (asp.net) not an endorsement (i.e., asp.net, which for a number of reasons, sucks) are there any good resources for js project (not necessarily walking you through code) ideas? hmmm, i should add the caveat: (must be interesting to coder which is subjective lol) some good ideas. i think the key is thinking up something (i.e., a project to practice) that interests you. need really drives outcome  yes, it\\'s ancient but most applicable @mehroshh - thor or dwight yokum perhaps, (necessity comment) scrubs is (was) a great show  the administrator (or head) doc is also one of the \\'bobs\\' in office space what? i had to look that up (i.e., band after scrubs) these were seasons well after i stopped watching... that\\'s funny  i\\'ll have to pull up some of those episodes; however, the core-cast renditions of erasure and poison songs are funny as heck yeah, i started to defect midway through: can\\'t believe the show went as far as it did after that - i\\'ve been doing too many coding exercises, and am digressing into media i would have to intersperse all of the remaining scrubs episodes with my coding exercises... high commitment, but will take into consideration @tourn171  - if, there\\'s a tear jerker, well...  white noise (a think there\\'s an article in news link) works for some... if i have something that\\'s really funny in another window it totally distracts me   i saw an article about an 80-90s era actor who passed up role, thn returned geany is good (of course i say this every time i see a text editor discussion) people skills (i.e., moving up the ladder) will oddly enough, serve you well in coding too vb is kind of a curse: find myself, sometimes, translating concepts in new languages to that (lang) looking forward to the database portion of this (these) course(s) linux is great (although, completely removing win (vm) from machine still proves elusive) i jump back and forth between kde and enlightenment desktops... (just rambling) @okelano been down the xubuntu route... have a couple of those (vm). very straightforward interface  kde for a lot of gnome folks is heresy (i understand) but it\\'s pretty handy agree, terminal is the best wouldn\\'t you just adjust your evaluation condition to match the desired jump  @evaristoc, didn\\'t catch the whole comment (it was a response) ; however, got me thinking in other application/concept  @okelano , no sorry needed.. (i was saying i didn\\'t catch the whole thing) - it did get me thinking about iteration in general... you -can- iterate over low level things like strings, but maybe higher order objects are better performance wise that\\'s neat. never thought to use a visualizer tool for regex (which i\\'m always trying to improve) agree... (still am no master) when i came across regular expressions (lang /implementation -independent) many year ago,,, i was like \"wow. powerful\" is it hard to jump back and forth between \\'pure\\' javascript and jquery? is most of this (course) pretty much codecademy with an occasional waypoint video (not intended as sarcasm, just wondering if there are different resources as you progress) @clintoncampbell, i suppose that makes sense as you could view fcc as a learning framework in itself  so, i see a lot of references to bonfires.. what are they? (yes, i could search through documentation etc.) nice, thanks @jonslucas.  (for the \\'use your resources crowd\\': there\\'s also a conversational element to things) just sayin @adventurebear, am about midway through javascript...   thank you @adventurebear , have some experience in programming (and other technologies), but thought this would be good  that\\'s actually a good question @adventurebear - i think i see most of this (i.e., various technologies) as a \\'wrapper\\' to the database stuff -which is the general direction of goal  well, if you\\'re developing anything for enterprise or small organization db, is going to be in the mix -hopefully not too vague... in response to @adventurebear    would add that you would, also, be sol when somebody asks you to explain the reasoning behind your code @adventurebear , nope... i think my brain is overloaded a bit i agree with that @pwackerman ... i, also, work through it (challenges) .. the exception being simple syntax rules can\\'t you do that in html5? (since security prone flash is going away (at least that\\'s what they say) is there an html5 equivalent to timeline based animation? (that people have actually used, etc) javascript is often underestimated... as i go through the lessons, and read varies articles - it has all kinds of stuff going for it  @cloudynetwork , that\\'s exactly what i was thinking / referring... a lot of js books (at that time) presented it (lang) in oversimplified terms (not to mention the rip-off: vbscript) yes @cloudynetwork, that\\'s why noscript was such a great add-on  the new \\'blinking cursor\\' of this century... is auto-start media if you code until solution (without any \\'externals\\'-   big-salary promise, etc)  because it (any problem) bugs you... you will probably do ok regex (though i use it to a degree in shell) can be daunting in some cases, (in the js exercises) it\\'s hard to discern if it\\'s user error or the parameters of the exercise i was doing the \\'iterating over keys/value\\' exercise as well...followed the instructions etc., returned what was required... but, also researched.. and found object.keys method (thought it was interesting) if you\\'re working with a lot of data, regex (which is still seems more difficult to internalize than other things) is really powerful --- i\\'ve seen visualizer tools for regex (mentioned here before) - looks worthwhile to check out here\\'s a dumb question: can you mix \\'vanilla\\' javascript and jquery in the same page? (e.g., reference a plain .js file for some some things) nice.. ty @ngalluzzo , @mrxinu -,  so, really, a bunch of frameworks can be employed @pwackerman that\\'s kind of what i\\'m getting at (i.e., is there a potential clash in employing a lot of frameworks and classic/\\'vanilla\\' what have you javascript)   ok, library i\\'m still working my way through the js exercises, (won\\'t be tweaking libraries for awhile) swig isn\\'t defined as a function n is getting pushed to the array  (with subsequent values) but doesn\\'t have an initial declaration (have no idea just thinking through for practice) value to declaration that is it\\'s the reference not the value that i\\'m driving at.... (if they were immutable, life would suck) at what point in course should one get a codepen account (or something like it) i.e., when does it make sense? am about 70% through, the js portion (who knew that the closing brace(in my case) could be such a pain.  btw... have been enjoying your screen-casts/walk-through(s) @quincylarson    nice.  (new js curriculum) - hello hi @rasheinstein  so, as i\\'m going through js etc... i\\'m starting to get a feel for it (i think) - there seems to be some sort of implicitness in it (beyond variables)- can\\'t put my finger on it (sorry to get metaphysical) @inyono, i think that, also, speaks to the oddness (but usefulness) or grasping js\\'  (still in process) so, now i\\'m like \\'doesn\\'t make sense but looks really useful\\'  other language paradigms keep floating into process  yeah, it seems you can pass anything as an argument that was a handy tip \\'\\'\\' ``` rather put that coffee down: coffee is for coders.. (sorry, i couldn\\'t resist movie reference) have a window mach in vm (am glad it\\'s not my primary os anymore) the windows 10 upgrade seems a little sketchy...  so, is ms still offering the upgrade for free... or is the window passed  not nervous to try new windows version, but the upgrade process appears to be fraught with potential issues @zuchit, there\\'s also a path from windows 7 i think microsoft decided that windows 7 was too stable... (or not tile friendly ) go linux  kde here as well,  (also curious about desktop client) is there a distinction (plasm) plasma i.e., plasma desktop is an extension of kde(n)  no? yep, (kde4) .... i was trying to remember a handy terminal one liner for kde version but without screenedges my workflow would come to a halt depends, (kubuntu, bodhi, xubuntu...) you might have to download proprietary drivers (a lot of linux installs don\\'t necess default to this) @vniche  what distro are you currently using, again? wouldn\\'t happen to be nvidia would it? some distros, have search pages (i.e., you plug your model # in) where you can see if it might be for you or not or is supported although i\\'m reaching back in time a bit i see where you have some issues (i.e., model #) with linux  (i.e., ubuntu, mint community pages) there are linux publications that have sampler dvds (yes , antithetical to the whole web thing) why not just try a whole cr*p load of different distros? that is one of the things, about linux ... you can screw stuff up no question i really haven\\'t had a lot of problems with drivers either.... the reason that there are some issues... is because there has been historical incentive for manufactures to deal with linux no historical incentive that is backup your home directory -----  less motivated on friday afternoons yes, but much talk no worky system sorry, went away for awhile . @vniche  did you get your graphics card issue worked out  oh, that\\'s great (working system)  i think there\\'s a twitch. tv announcement/event re: new course on saturday ```//some code comment test\\n grrrr great, now i\\'m going to have to learn \\'git flavored markdown\\' https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/ i\\'m reading the faq, but don\\'t know if it works  ```//some comment\\n``` hello\\n same here, (i.e., do the exercises on my own)...   slow pace apropos friday jesus is all about coding in c  just kidding best vs. what free vs free... free vs. paid? sandboxing into linux (vm) sounds like a good idea (although i keep seeing comments like this doesn\\'t work , etc. etc) maybe a secondary system is a good idea...  beyond, compiling stuff... etc...,  security should also be a concern @exenza , agreed... sed = regex in production still is not natural (the regex patterns) to me  is pair programming a requirement? i\\'m actually glad (it\\'s not) although, to what degree do you (open question) think that somebody hiring for a developer position wants a candidate who works well on dev team vs . alone @itegman , hear you and actually agree... hello hr people usually don\\'t... however, they\\'re not making the final decisions @thedeuceii, yep.. that\\'s closer to reality   it\\'s good to have a balance of (i can do this) and (what will i reasonably be paid for it)...,  (really companies and non--profits are not heaving big barrels of money at newbies) @chocobowings , second the volunteering part  i\\'d like to learn python (but, am focused on js)  it\\'s really tempting to do do dual route learning -do although honestly, i also run into a lot of heavy file intensive stuff.... and perl keeps beckoning @jdayvie, it basically is spreading yourself too thin across multiple languages  for all of flash\\'s issues... i will be glad when there\\'s an html5 equivalent to timeline animation or maybe \\'timeline\\' is an old paradigm that will be replaced as well @royshouvik , i think i recall a linux distro that actually incorporated that into video sort of an overlay @royshouvik  that\\'s ok.  i\\'ve seen that (i believe)... the authoring aspect is very different (if we\\'re talking about the same thing) flash is still everywhere (in fact, i had to switch to a vm to watch fcc monthly - browser prompt: get flash)  @michael-krebs , not fast enough (i\\'m ready for flash to go the way of java applets) but, for all of its (flash) issue, will sort of miss layers, timelines, clips that sentence was constructed in flawless english. you shouldn\\'t have any issues with coding in it as well hi, all. anybody having any issues with fcc not tracking progress? (my case am near js completion) but is taking me back to \\'hello world\\' weird. (but thank you , @ashiantfb: that seems to get things back in order)  mac and windows, sigh... where\\'s the love for linux? google\\'s search suggestions have grown exponentially. but parsing into short syntax is helpful (e.g.,  html anchors) you can exclude terms with minus + quotes google isn\\'t the only search engine (though, you wouldn\\'t think so these days) the tip that i got (thanks again) for resetting my waypoint progress, got me looking at the entire list of stuff still to complete dang the only thing missing is yoda having me move rocks around and stuff well, face the rest of js challenge you must (yoda\\'isms theme difficult to shake)... ok, back to,...  hello hi and thank you i\\'ve found that codecademy\\'s \\'hint\\' section in each exercise is more (\\'this is part more part 2 of the excercise, read it... or you\\'ll have no clue\\')   fcc is doing a custom build js curriculum (i like that idea)  flash sucks for a lot of reasons - but apple pushed its  (impending) demise  yeah, a lot of sites are falling inline with (bye to flash) maybe i can get creative suite for a discount when flash finally kicks the byte bucket well that is the git concept (correct?) wasn\\'t the whole linux kernal done in a (prototype) version of git ? e i\\'m looking forward to the github aspect of curriculum (yes, somewhat rhetorical) have come accross it before trying to be sequential... but it\\'s tempting ty @benmcmahon100 , also... if you apt-cache search github there\\'s a cli tool there (didn\\'t run a policy directive.. so, no clue how long that package has been there)... walk before run without backend (database stuff) you really don\\'t have a site that does anything meaningful imho think of it this way... front end developer says: \\'can\\'t do that\\' or \\'can\\'t do that in x period of time\\'...if you know front end (as well) you can say that\\'s total bs and here\\'s why that\\'s not a hypothetical (really) don\\'t flame out... am trying the absorb route (not knocking other approaches) @srodman7689 i get it (the excitement aspect is showing through, no doubt.... good stuff) can\\'t \\'make\\' (browsers have different security settings) haven\\'t gotten to some of these examples; however, wouldn\\'t a standard --blah-blah works best with javascript enabled be agood idea? what\\'s the projected date of new site? (i.e., fcc now in beta) will i have to do js over (not that it\\'s a problem) i\\'m trying to figure out if ca\\'s lesson instructions are really some brilliant way to introduce user to dealing with ambiguity i noted (in the broadcast) that life hacker really bumped traffic... could be dealing with capacity but turn those back on when you\\'re done it\\'s amazing how much stuff doesn\\'t work w/o js. (just in general) @brockson007  agree yeah, it\\'s like most kung-fu masters are ok and all... but then there\\'s a few that give a bad name (hence the blocking add-ons) leave the space white space in bash is a pain i do a lot of file parsing in bash (sed mostly) script. no guru , but it\\'s much easier than (dare i say it) powershell i\\'ll take it (lol) here\\'s the thing... non-profits (many) work on pretty thin margins... even though, development might be \\'free\\' their time is not... am towards the end of (the first) js section (i think there\\'s more) still have to keep one foot in ms technologies, on some level that bugs me... the zone comes and goes... at least for me example projects are necessary (yes, yes, i know) but if it\\'s something i\\'ve created, it\\'s compelling  i think the paperclip had a name (how do i turn this off!) i remember when that came out mouse event, keyboard event you could tie functionallity to window name or it could send a shutdown signal... you wanted motivation lol oh, eah that\\'s right: clippy. you could also, use the dog animation as well....pure evil yeah but chrome store has all these things like code review... i think your invasive plugin will no pass muster (lol) yes, but microsoft already cornered the market on \\'annoying the hell out of you\\'  their new thing: mandatory updates. wtf. linux will always be primary that\\'s what a whiteboard, marker, and interviewer with common sense is for who is probably thinking the same thing.... ok, i think \\'the only thing\\' i have left for js section...is build cash register which i\\'m not building right now as my brain is looping over ca\\'s bad instructions didn\\'t see full context of comment... but make sure you know what you\\'re doing before applying update (use a select statement to test first) there\\'s a difference between displaying date (or other) formats in a select statement vs. actually changing the column attributes in a table... again, no idea of context of question (just throwing that in there) after reading through ca\\'s exercises (yes, i\\'m still on that) i question whether i\\'m barely literate test with select first (always) @raincode , just general info... with sql (i.e., to benefit in general). the main idea is this: update and delete, can affect (depending on joins etc.) pretty much everything... so, you want to use select   first to return what you expect, (because it\\'s the same thing that you\\'ll affect) sql is a nice break from the cash register thing i have to complete some of these exercises got me thinking about scope (js) how does scoping work in js? if i define a function (in it\\'s referenced in say file1) i can\\'t call/use it in other contexts? @ronstarcool , yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m bouncing back and forth... there\\'s a \\'sequence element\\' in scope take the file part out for a second.... and we\\'re talking inline i just hope the beta to live switch doesn\\'t happen like a few minutes away from completing js that would suck virtualbox is great, (still prefer it to vmware) that\\'s because of the drag files from host to guest feature (i think) greetings isn\\'t there a gitter for linux as well? looks interesting nice @jack1618 ...might install in a vm and check it out how do you like the new version of windows? (not my main os, but have a machine that i should probably upgrade) seriously? (awsomeness) i might try that (linux version)... the ms upgrade, if i commit, will likely take awhile seems like pretty positive reception (ok, sample size not scientific) , i kind of felt that way about win 7  hello all though unicorns are indeed magical, i pretty sure they have stable attendants feedly and life hacker for me (although that was a couple of weeks ago, i think) so, all the things that were \\'super-science-fiction\\' in star trek are pretty lame by what we now have (e.g., communicator vs. smart phone). i\\'m looking forward to the machine (replicator) that makes lunch doh, the holodeck... i forgot that you can eat, and be on another planet you\\'re right: 3d... is close. all the gadgets in space movies/shows look silly compared to reality. (i am however, waiting for the light saber turkey slicer ) @andreimariusb  i seriously prefer convience to kung-fu chopping turkey for sandwiches @benmcmahon100 , in a lot of ways the communicator (1st gen) was a freakin flip phone @andreimariusb  you\\'re assuming that kung-fu skills will work on a turkey. they are fast and illusive. i\\'d have to settle on eating mud and dirt wait, @benmcmahon100 , they had sliding doors in star treck...? synthetic mud and dirt are the worst 007 is totally realistic. whose to say that a guy with metal teeth couldn\\'t bite holes in cars? who\\'s yes, but there was no air pump (aquariam bubbles) for the whales in that movie and they dumped them into the future... just to save earth come to think of it, there was no scene of aquarium cleaning in that (star trek) movie saw the beta in screen-cast, i\\'m going to wait (and hope the progress that i\\'m achieving in current site isn\\'t erased) @benmcmahon100  yep, most of it seems to be in codecademy any way i think you can (or supposed to anyway, they\\'re looking for feedback (bugchecks, etc.) yeah, but having to do it again... hmmm i\\'m reading this as (you\\'ll have to do it again) lol hello is there a malfunction or is it this slow wow, suspense so, in the intervening silence... i decided to google javascript error handling (my progress in course hasn\\'t touched on this).. i was like \\'where\\'s the error handling\\'? if you are regexing large strings (that have natural spaces like a sentence) that could be problematic down the road still on js error handling... looks complicated (from what i\\'ve read so far) @vincepandolfo , yes... however, i\\'m seeing ajax ... and specific libraries and other stuff thrown in totally i\\'m at the latter part of js (maybe i\\'ll knock it out tonight) i know i\\'ve said it before; however, js is pretty bad a**. (and totally underestimated) i have this book (got it at sale or something) that has js section (it mentions windows 95 on cover ) it\\'s interesting comparing the difference between (js) then and now that\\'s pretty neat (it\\'s scaled down) oh, so .png(s) are scaled to a predetermined size? in this (gitter)? if you\\'re doing runtimes, you may need to choose other (language(s) not mentioned in a or b) i have to get used to the prepending screen name to comments. it so un-natural language wise. it\\'s like saying \"bob pass me the pen, bob-thank you for pen\" etc. do your credentials (i.e., those that work in production site) work in beta? (i.e., can i login with what i\\'ve got?) ok, is that good or bad? the holy cr** part that is i saw part of it on screen-cast... i\\'d like to check it out. @quincylarson, is it (relatively) safe to login with existing credentials? (yes, beta, i know but somewhat cautious)  i\\'ll have to check the site out... still don\\'t know but will figure it out. i imagine @quincylarson is mobbed like pre-1978 elvis when he comes in to room gimp and gradient is all i need c++ wants his records back oh, basic... the nights of green screen and the commands at the bottom thumbing through the ibm binder that was great but now ibm is all about linux (why i have a soft spot) and serious (serious) servers @vincepandolfo , competitive programming? sounds interesting yeah, i would; however, i can go a day without \"your coding skills are weak\" or \"guess how many soldering points are on your board, do you know, huh?\" @vincepandolfo that part sounds good (practice) i would guess (again, guess i have no clue) not since different sequence, different stuff @vincepandolfo , that\\'s the part i like (in general) when i\\'m feeling over-confident, i\\'m knocked down (in a good strive for learning way) pretty quickly @claytongentry , i still have to login to it  @vincepandolfo , it the area of language(s) , coding... cs what have you, there\\'s always something to learn (or different approach) there\\'s no summit glad for linux. stupid windows upgrade...  @benmcmahon100  looking for the elusive upgrade icon. maybe the iso download will go sooner. reason #450 windows sucks  smoother yeah, linux is my os; however, i have to switch back and forth between vms to do stuff (can\\'t completely disengage windows ) hey, neat trick: i saw (in real time) you correct your spelling your i would imagine oem accounts for large majority (i.e., meets those parameters) a lot of the exercises seem to have variable declaration within loops.. is this a js thing? isn\\'t that bad practice (no sarcasm, just curious)  zombies don\\'t need stinking language skills (lol) well, you can pretty much some up any zombie dialog as a variant of: \"they\\'re zombies\", \"it was a science experiment\", \"oh, cr*p lookout\" yes, there\\'s a community angle to it (i.e., fcc) which i think may be a good thing well, you need to work through your challenges (exercises, etc.) the notifications in this app (gitter) could use a little work (don\\'t need to know of a mention that happened in the 20th century)  can bonfires be done solo? @misterrorypond , yeah that would (also) be my preferred method how do you feel about your progress (yes, open ended) i love stack overflow (yes, as well as 5 billion other people) well, at least the windows .iso seems smaller than in the past please twitch.tv go to html5 already what\\'s the difference between code tags and ``` in this (gitter) app oh, ok... i thought there was something new... i think you were going for a \\'foo\\' like reference to concept looks like the 2nd css class is invalid (at least by the editor highlighter)  nm put it in another editor .. highlights correctly i was going by the gitter highlighting... however, (more correctly) i use geany or notepad++ in wine backtick somebody mentioned (previsously) that you can drag an image over (haven\\'t tried it) @arielleslie , @okelano yep, somebody asked how to pull image over into (gitter) ```\\n<!-- some test comment -->\\nvar code = \"formatted\";\\n``` is the variable (code) supposed to display?\\n  hello here\\'s something i just learned the hard way: if you have code by all measure should work, but fails it might be that you need to refresh page. sheesh, i want all those minutes of my life back  codecademy based exercises that is a total (what you said) lol concentrate on the coding aspect first (i.e., learning it) then, post (to whatever, peers etc.) for review if it\\'s an enterprise level application (and your concerns are valid, depending on industry ) don\\'t deploy based on stuff you\\'ve gathered from  around the web... work with dedicated security professionals. what are the advantages of the gitter app vs. browser? (i\\'ve run both, no apparent advantage... am i missing something?) ah, tab-anti clutter if they even bother calling you in for an interview, that means you\\'re ahead of a lot of other people always be prepared for the follow-up question don\\'t try to memorize, understand. (you may need to elaborate with examples) hello ty... i\\'ve been working on curriculum for a couple of weeks.  partial newb vs. complete good attitude to have (if you\\'re an expert in everything, you\\'re probably not growing) either that or you become the primary resource nowhere that (i.e., 800 hrs) just at end of js (can see the light, almost) one problem is there is no else that would be true if the argument were valid 1st argument so, it never returns true or false (you\\'re technically correct, if everything is perfect ) what would be the point of returning true outside the loop? wouldn\\'t that negate the results of looping over the string? yeah but it doesn\\'t evaluate to either true or false, it returns a string oh, cache you\\'re such a pain you\\'re correct: it\\'s not returning a string, i\\'ve been burned on cache... (my new approach: reset everything 50 times) depends on what you bring to the table (experience, projects) -- no cache error here the one thing (well, many) i look forward to after js, is getting back to fcc\\'s more homegrown instruction. (codecademy, has some issues with explanation and setup) there\\'s a lot of implied stuff in ca\\'s instructions (i\\'m like \"where are you getting this?\") @arielleslie yep, it\\'s good for its repetition (which is needed) i actually \"came back\" to codecademy (by way of fcc) so, looked at a synopsis of udacity. interesting concept. has sort of a technician aspect (as if say ford or nissan where doing the training for their specific needs) @dshgna, well i guess i\\'ll have to look into it (i\\'m mean if it\\'s mandatory and all) lol  oh, mozilla is great... the webide is kind of fun to run things in (although reference are limited in the project scope) @dshgna  got that. i was extending my comments to include mozilla developer (in general) and the  tools available in ff (both great) failure is built-in (debugging, error handling, etc) to programming.  it\\'s not a loaded term. are the people who are near, the non-profit finish line (so, to speak)? there can you fine-tune directory access (i wouldn\\'t want application (pairing or otherwise) to be able to traverse)? hello, again ending part of js is going slow... (not difficult but monotonous)  @raultsc , i\\'m glad i\\'m not the only one who feels that way are there any more codecademy things after js? (i.e., happy learning... then surprise, more codecademy)4 @raincode i heard somebody mention udacity earlier... @nathandim, i think you mean \\'head wet\\' (as codecademy invokes desire for head in toilet)  i have to stop harping on codecademy if you already have skills, why not skip to volunteering opportunities? (i.e., there\\'s a learning element in this (program) paradigm). this is to say, there are all kinds of opportunities out there so, i use geany (and to a lessor extent, notepad++ in wine)... i see sublime has an evaluation period...  any thoughts on this editor (have seen it mentioned a few times here) ? (is it worth the $70.00 (u.s. bucks)?  i can deal with nag-screens (with full functionallity) maybe will give it a try the demo page\\'s depiction of the auto-complete features looked really interesting is github integration a deal-breaker for editors? (geany works great for what it is) that makes sense (i.e., the more \\'production code\\' then, the greater need for git integ) @terabyte , i have to agree.... the whole scm thing is new to me (though wasn\\'t just hatched out of turnip truck recently) there are cli packages for git (at least in vanilla \\'buntu\\' distros) sounds like it\\'s a more involved concept (or broad, like \\'project management\\') i find git (or whatever alternative) more intimidating than language(s)  that\\'s the thing, i think i lean more in the direction of what @terabyte is conveying (at the conceptual level) @arielleslie so your comfort level has grown (i.e., with git)? @thiagoferreir4, @arielleslie ty... i\\'ll read-up on git (conceptually) and commands.   wow. i\\'m all \\'git - upped\\' - will digest... well, 20/30 of final js section (and its mocking me every step of the way) it\\'s js lack of (but crafty use) explicit datatypes is interesting is there a colon where a decimal should be? (not kidding, i actually have to use a zoom app to see) if <= isn\\'t used , there\\'s a 0.01 gap in first condition vs <  a bit tangential but, does operator precedence affect comparison (in equation, of course.... but saw an example where lower number was last) i think (well suspect) that they do matter... @arielleslie.  my guess is there\\'s a performance issue if used improperly   i think lucas was making an indirect political statement when he wrote that for obi-wan i\\'m pretty sure the guy they got to play (pre) darth vader did not pick up on the irony (lol) well,  it was supposed to end with the ewoks - but there is another (at least that\\'s what all the hype is about)... so, consistent with \\'forward looking\\' seeing the x-wings flying over water... pretty much cemented it for me won\\'t give you the answer; however, think \\'overlap\\' and how would you detect? or the crashed imperial cruisers in sand i\\'d have to replay trailer ....  how would darth vader made it off the the 2nd death star without life support (helmet) and luke not mentioning to leia \"hey,  by the way\"  make and let\\'s not forget vader\\'s halo (you standing astride of yoda and obi-wan) waving at luke know although they did find a way to bring back ellen ripley (by cloning) in aliens - but,. i agree, luke is more than likely talking to his son ah cloning - not just for sheep, but now you can resurrect any character to keep a movie franchise going lol  slims pickens is now back (by virtue of cloning) to do dr. strangelove ii the cloning thing only came in the prequels (mirroring advancements in popular culture and science)... i wouldn\\'t be surprised if there\\'s some sort of reference to an imperial internet provider in the new movie yeah it is cannon (the books i think there\\'s some sort of \\'clear story line\\' with... first).  without googling, my guess is lucas wasn\\'t pulling anything in parallel with books (i.e., they did not exist in the 70\\'s) just don\\'t get sidetracked with star wars you\\'ll be ok i completed this (am at the latter part of js). i would go directly to the exercise to get a clean summary (or shell)... and work from there. again, two things can exist at the same time (hint) codeademy still taunting me at 97% js completion i\\'m like right at the verge of completing, and it\\'s as though they got tired of writing the course at the end (ca).   they being codecademy so, i can read the course map and all... but for those of you who have completed js, is the stuff after (immediately or somewhat) a break from the monotonous aspects?  agree (i.e., memorization). syntax (brace here, semicolon there) should never derail your learning if you know the concepts (although it can be a serious pita no doubt) serious specs @imdwit .  hopefully atom isn\\'t adopting windows or adobe\\'s approach to software (aka.. build more eat more) i could swear that i\\'ve seen ruby on bookshelves of stores going back many years i agree... jumping back and forth chasing languages without being proficient (pick one at least) isn\\'t the best way to go linux and mac are *nix like... but, linux offers more freedom imo are there new features in gitter (like just deployed )  ? i find js is underestimated an interesting read is to look at development job ads, there seems to be a prevailing \\'high-level this, that\\' - in favor of certain languages (perhaps not based on utility, but rather on inertia) i see the tea pot example a lot. what section is this? (haven\\'t gotten there yet)  oh, ok. i think the bonfire things is nearing \\'bonfire thing is nearing\\' that is. (wasn\\'t going for pirate inflection)  does split actually parse into an array (w3 mentions this)? like an actual array with index? or just a string (sans the deliminator) that\\'s interesting... you get fine control of the elements of the parsed string i sometimes wonder if this is some type of turing test the refresh thing is funny... in codecademy, i had working code that refused to pass (yep, it was: (wait for it...) cache) you can copy to clipboard, refresh then paste back will save you a lot of heartache is there like a graph of  conversation activity along a timeline (you know where i can find the arc) @duttakapil, were you an earlier adopter of fcc? @duttakapil nice.  that\\'s how i was with codecademy , left came back (by fcc proxy ) that\\'s not encouraging (as i\\'m right at the end of (yes, i shall harp again) of the codecademy section)  i would imagine (by days launched + users added (and growing) that there\\'s not a huge percentage  of folks near the end (completion). i.e, this is all a growing process what are the most enjoyable sections of curriculum (yes, highly subjective)? i always wondered what saints do in their free time (coding of course, the answer was so obvious lol) i think you\\'d have to overwrite the element (i.e., construct a different string)... but not sure oh, yeah i still have to do the windows 10 thing ( in vm) - surprise, surprise update process not smooth what\\'s a pomodoras?  seriously oh, so you\\'d have to do it in off hours and while not driving is it an actual word? doesn\\'t seem to translate into anything i think you\\'re right. i\\'ve seen it on a can.... so, we\\'re tomatoes when engaging in coding challenges ?   i\\'ve been doing the curriculum for a couple of weeks.. and i still feel awkward (i\\'m talking about pasta sauce ingredients after all) don\\'t worry about it  alright, i\\'m friggin two questions away from completing js (been like within four questions for the last two days)... what the...? lol i wouldn\\'t let regex derail you. are you trying to move away from database (which for, me is in my comfort zone) to front end development? @shannonfears , not a bad thing to have in your overall knowledge base -  @shannonfears  don\\'t worry...,  a lot of this can be challenging (i\\'m at a 98% roadblock) i haven\\'t gotten to the regex parts (of this curriculum) however, use it in bash scripts. it is daunting  seems counter-intuitive wouldn\\'t (in a non-programming construct) manager inherit from employee?  i think the friday lag has set in (for some people it might be next thursday or yesterday) can\\'t you shortcut by comparing two arrays (without iterating through each element)? (just wondering, ) nm, stackoverflow has a neat post on comparing arrays (although looks complicated) are there libraries (of the js flavor) that have \\'functions\\' that can do simple things like comparing objects without having to interate? iterate that is @dueldrawer8  yeah need one more at the end brace that is  is electronica good for overcoming js blocks? i just finished the js course (serious pita). so, not really super important in comparison to the geopolitical vein today...  but, i\\'m glad. ty @biancamihai. so, now it\\'s regex. great.  ty @jdayvie  nooo, not \\'better\\' lol one thing (among many) that throws me is chaining methods (with  functions). why don\\'t i have to close each function with ; ?  (yes - , - is the separator) the \\'rules\\' change when occurring  in the object, i think. i see what you\\'re saying @ninjatron  oh, ok i think i see the difference here.  you\\'re showing a literal chain where (as it implies) you\\'re feeding action/result ->, action/result -> action/result ->.  i think my use of \\'chaining\\' did not fit what i was asking (my mistake). i was refering to methods in objects (that may appear sequentially but do not necessarily act upon each other)that are functions, that don\\'t require a semi-colon terminator. @ninjatron , there are things that just don\\'t make sense. i think (it seems as i go along) that you have to be comfortable with some amount of ambiguity. yep, got nodejs (from repository) and integrated (at project level) with sublime (something i\\'m trying out, as geany & notepad++ are my go tos) you too would agree with @jhealy86 : a lot of it depends on what your needs are. it\\'s not uncommon to have different editors open at the same time  the cash register exercise really was a pain i look at codecademy with a silver lining: it\\'s an (unintentional) reflection of real-world challenges  hello aren\\'t the html elements stored in the larger framework @thiagoferreir4 , you\\'ll probably, also, pickup stuff from other developers in your role (congrats) i\\'ve got things to do... i\\'m thinking regex isn\\'t a good multitasking lesson @wundertunge , codecademy has a lot of those. (in fact, there are things that are carried over for no apparent reason (e.g., return statement) from lesson, to lesson equality and type vs.  @thiagoferreir4 , i imagine that you\\'ll aquire knowledge one of two ways: 1. somebody will say hey, you should do it this way.... or-- 2. hey, that\\'s super annoying, dude. do it this way (either way you\\'ll learn lol)  are there any codecademy lessons after js?  @michael-krebs , i was trying not to go there (because i can\\'t mention codecademy without giving it fair amount of criticism - ok, they suck) lol coding does seem to impart certain dislike for punctuation  the } is mine what\\'s that? good thing there\\'s not a cheddar breed @mhelmetag , yes i did it (i.e., set a cheese joke in motion) it will slow down at js first one thing to keep in mind: a lot of the examples (and this is changing by virtue of the beta site) seem to be drawing from a lot of disparate resources (websites etc.). each has its/their own idiosyncrasies i was on cheese, before i\\'m going to comment just so i can attempt to scroll lady gaga out of my field of view @michael-krebs ! that is f- awsome i would use the whole word (however i won\\'t) just because that\\'s great ok, back to expand i completed js today; however, being able to collapse is so much more significant  (ok, i\\'m just kidding - but good tip thank you) and bash if you want to go in depth (no pun intended) use hex colors w3 has a good reference. but for purposes of exercise, \\'orange\\' would probably suffice. sounds like the code is wrong great. i am not re-doing js beta/no beta lol ok, as long as it\\'s not codecademy.  where \\'you should know what we mean, even though we neither implied or stated it, reigns\\' hey, the collapse thing isn\\'t working that raises a good question: what kind of limits (which i hope there are, as i love my machine) are there on stuff running in gitter @thiagoferreir4  yeah, it\\'s a neat tip that @michael-krebs mentioned earlier. if a post (like a long piece of code) is cramming your window up.. you \\'collapse it\\' /collapse  code doesn\\'t limit itself to just your browser @thiagoferreir4 , no, no... i would never actually try to collapse your pen example. i was just talking about all the other stuff (ok, i\\'m totally lying: tried to collapse pen, didn\\'t work) lol if you\\'re running windows 95, please install linux @thiagoferreir4 , windows 95 was still running over dos, in its \\'heyday\\'.   dos games were great.  i think i recall reading that @alc1982 -- wasn\\'t there a bunch of litigation that kept it from rolling out? i can\\'t remember the dos game, but it had something to do with the original developer selling rights to a religious organization (that essentially sat on the patent) then he couldn\\'t release any variant of the game...   but now - it is being reintroduced so this was in the early 1980s? oh, ok... there was a lot of difference in late 80\\'s/early 90\\'s - vs mid early 80\\'s -- average phone now , could probably run more than 500 comparable pcs of that time (500 might be on the high side... or not , but you get the idea) which by way of long loop around....i don\\'t remember the cats lol possible, though i remember nintendo was becoming more and more popular (yet there were also, pc games) 5.0 wait was it 6.0? i do remember those (disks) if you know wordstar you know early computing hello, it\\'s possible to love regex and be intimidated by it (use it in in scripts, still is a challenge) i think the pace (here) is competing with my battery indicator nope, just saw a % drop. indicator wins. happy coding/regex\\'ng  hi coders i thought bo staff skills was working with stinky developers do a lot of people have actual portfolios of work (here)? there\\'s the knowledge vs experience thing in terms of learning new technologies  how do potential employers evaluate bootcamp experience? @miguelc1221 i\\'ve seen that. i\\'m not completely sold on them  @imdwit , i guess that could add a certain incentive, (i.e., we\\'ve parted with (n) employer who needs (x) talent)... still partnered that is. @imdwit , that\\'s the true test. seriously, when you\\'re (i.e., recruiters, employers) offering high salary... it isn\\'t just magic unicorns and popcorn..., they want (and should) to see concrete examples that you\\'re qualified. @imdwit , i hope you get it. i think if you really love to code/develop you\\'ll be ok.  i\\'m just focused on completing the course... i look at as a means to augment my other it skills. - i see the potential; however,  i know that benefits to anything come with time and hard work. have you finished the fcc course? that\\'s pretty subjective (editor) @cobunny , taking courses (any but with general direction of what your want) might help with the foundational understanding to say : \"ok, this is what i need to take next\" (works for me any way) @cobunny , there\\'s always the risk of \"completely wasting your time\" with any course/endeavor but if you don\\'t commit (to one or more courses), you have a 100% chance of not achieving what you want ok, i\\'ve been so philosophical i could barf. any way, anybody have any good recommendations for regex (i use it to some extent, but have not mastered it) @cobunny, i understand. i think you just want to maximize your investment in time (because let\\'s face it, time can be more valuable than money)... nothing wrong with that..  anybody regex? -- good resources? ty @jbmartinez ...  even without the js component, regex (i\\'ve used it with sed) is wicked powerful tool howdy @thiagovandieten ty for that. i see a lot of online \\'type as you go highlighting\\' (which i think is really neat)... i wonder if there\\'s a linux package (or add-on to editor) that you can enter pattern and see as you type @thiagovandieten , yeah most do (notepad++ , and i think sublime) it will \\'find\\' based on pattern, but i was thinking \\'find as you\\'re typing) @sigshane got bluefish it\\'s good for the html bits although you can edit js and other stuff (even though i\\'m trying out sublime, i really am partial to geany) geany rules although geany is really a pita in terms of user defined languages, (adding and such) @sigshane , there are a lot of people who swear by it (vim), i\\'m not sure for editing, i\\'m willing to commit to vim\\'s requirements (learning curve)  it\\'s the utilities that make linux... they are so focused (i.e., do one thing well) and \\'chainable\\' or do one thing | take from that | then do this... i think pacing yourself is key... if you get hung up on time taken (this is a problem i had with codecademy the first go round), you end up getting frustrated np @blueaccords  the projects will reveal themselves as you learn (at least that\\'s what the yoda like part things would suggest to me)  hello, again maybe it\\'s because mozilla has express roots in js (historically, at least taking the political aspects out) even if you don\\'t apply it (i\\'m on the regex section too) to \\'web-centric\\' stuff it (regex) is language agnostic and very useful.  i\\'m still reading up on git (although got sidetracked with regex). it would seem that part of version control aspect is what can be included upstream (i.e., there\\'s got to be some sort of vetting aspect to projects) sometimes i get playback errors, but chrome seems to handle those well. i think the video aspect (fcc ) is hosted from a service @jonatan-b , it might be opera itself, there are a lot of hits with video playback issues so, looked at the page source on waypoints... it\\'s vimeo this might be helpful https://vimeo.com/help/faq/watching-videos/playback-issues codecademy is frustrating to no end.  they may (or may not depending on your perspective) have commend of the code. relating the concepts is not their (codecademy) forte  but isn\\'t that in essence hosting a website (i.e., making a page project) from git (would that even work even if it\\'s limited to learning scale etc.)  @turroger it\\'s my understanding that you\\'re not required to pair i think there\\'s a seinfeld episode of do the opposite whatever fits your learning style, go with it.  there are a lot of helpful folks, here. sometimes i see some great nuggets of knowledge scroll by (along with the typical \\'how much money will i make\\'?  \\'how long will it take\\' etc. questions) i don\\'t know for me... project wise, it\\'s like this: high-level description, figure out the technologies to achieve.  non-applied stuff (even if it\\'s a test example) is really difficult to get through (at times) you can run html locally (i.e., not a website per se) all you need is a text editor and a browser (in its simplest form that is) notepad no. use an actual editor geany, sublime, etc. (notpad++) if you\\'re like exceptionally brilliant use notepad (i\\'m just kidding you can use notepad if you like) notepad won\\'t highlight the (respective( syntax (html, js, css... et al) . it\\'s easier to see what you\\'re doing (as well as being able to execute code (for other higher level projects/code) i had to laugh at the avatar thing everybody feels stupid with the \\'hello world\\' thing. it\\'s ok (lol) me either, i think i used to variant like \\'they made me do this\\'  to = some,  (can\\'t even choose correct word in sentence) so what\\'s plug dj? oh, i see...i\\'ll have to check it out. i can\\'t code with music eurodance, is great (why did it have to go) i think all routers need reset (too much for my taste) from time to time classic rock stations (in us) tend to play too much boston or kansas @jbmartinez admitting you like kansas is the first step in recovery lol (i\\'m just kidding of course) i went through the whole classic rock thing (as well as 80/90s metal)...   bring out the gimp (linux) sorry, couldn\\'t resist the pulp fiction reference although they were not talking about an open source image editor rush really became much tighter in late 80\\'s 90\\'s their stuff (fly by night , farewell to kings etc. ) was good too i never got into phil collins or bob dylan 2112 great album cover @danielnora i agree, he was more adult contemporary (even at that time) i was listening to iron maiden, and run dmc (yeah weird mix) so, i wasn\\'t in the \\'phil collins\\' zone all this phil collins talk reminds me of the office space scene (michael bolten reference) however you spell it no we weren\\'t. we were talking about phil collins. please, please change the topic (lol) a little off topic (the whole font thing got me thinking) but for svg , inkscape is great. however, it exports in all kinds of formats -so, have been using it for non-svg stuff as well.  -however power surge. was wondering why comments were so slow my wtf/min rate has actually increased oh, no paradox infinite loop crashing now..lol what\\'s essentially contained (at least my take) is wtf (like ok) and wtf... when one has to go back and fix something somebody else, has written. you stuff like not documenting intent , basic comments etc i haven\\'t gotten that far, but pair-programming (in terms of effectiveness) is subjective (i.e., really depends on your work style) are you posting valid fields (and not the button reference itself) i don\\'t know, php isn\\'t my forte i have to use (even though linux is my goto) a lot of ms.  the php vs. asp thing just came up in my mind... @danielnora that sounds like a neat project. (are you talking about the \\'unity\\' that forced me to switch to kde or xfce)  oh, there\\'s a unity for game development (wow,it\\'s a multi-platform framework) i\\'m not big into gaming development, but the unity tutorials look interesting, (just on first glance) just be prepared for js (in codecademy). the instructions are really bad. so, if you get frustrated... it\\'s highly likely \\'it\\'s not you\\' just have to work through it. but on the upside, i think fcc is doing a homegrown version of js @ashiantfb, yeah i\\'m anxious to try it out (although it will suck that i have to re-do (i think) js) welcome back @danielnora, i actually gave the unity website a look.  looks interesting (even if i\\'m not a gaming developer) @jonathanmusso , does it run in some sort of virtual runtime (like dare i say java)? where\\'s the love for linux  yeah, the js reference caught my attention because it\\'s been alluded to that you can use it outside of the confines of browser (yes, there are other things like actionscript from the dawn of time) i think it\\'s the compiled code paradigm, that hinders my full understanding of the newer js applications (literally) oh, the darn cash register yeah, that was fun.  that\\'s good to hear @ashiantfb , wait what? the beta will eventually be production. so, doesn\\'t that argue that i would need to redo? (at least it\\'s not codecademy) @ashiantfb , yeah that\\'s true. proprietary software is a crutch. and the worst part, is when the technology is replaced. life sucks. definitely support learning the fundamentals  i saw an article on beef brisket, use some tuna cans and liquid smoke to cook the chuck eye drag and drop (i.e, as a general construct) is useful where programming basic foundational stuff would be insane... but one can also becoming overly dependent (so, can see both sides) it\\'s what\\'s for dinner there was that and the egg campaign of the mid 90\\'s both sides are valid. from a non-gaming standpoint (and i\\'m a linux user and advocate). there is still demand for ms based technologies (although even they are even begining to embrace open source (out of shear survival) -- although, on the database side of things, ms is not too shabby  i\\'m supposed to be all about lamp stack (embracing linux) but there\\'s more than mysql i started using linux when a vista machine crapped out on me.... this was, of course, a long time ago. i was like wow, this is pretty cool @panamacitypc, linux has some disparate elements (e.g., when there\\'s a package that requires dependencies, from other desktops (and everything looks like, well, cr*p) - but it doesn\\'t require to by into an ecosystem (apple i\\'m talking about you) for everything    that would be \\'buy\\' vs. \\'by\\' nope, not even close (i.e., close to finishing) the html css, near beginning of the course is to sort of ease learner in. if it started with js, (especially codecademy) that would be more, um, problematic   there\\'s a bootstrap section if you do, you want to take care of that before presenting to a potential employer/client. (kind of like misspelling your name on resume)  what, you don\\'t like having cats take up 1/3 of your screen (pure blasphemy)  i\\'m up-voting more cats in all exercises and so close to what most people seek in web development: pages about cats @zhifuge  ty nothing like kanji and a bit of gradient it\\'s supposed to mean serenity  i was going to put something like serenity through code (however, images don\\'t scale well) @zhifuge , that\\'s also, applicable... i think there\\'s a difference between the root (chinese) language   and japanese (in terms of characters) -- i\\'m no linguist  what they stole my idea! (seriously i didn\\'t even know there was a movie) lame, it\\'s like i re-invented the wheel. \"hey, i got this cool round thing that you can put stuff on... wait, what...oh, you have that already\"? now i will have to look up kanji for popular internet cat memes i recall there where very limited jquery  (like what\\'s the point) waypoints before the js good luck fortran betamax should have won out  but i digress get used to the term \\'legacy\\' because you\\'ll find that a lot of old software does in fact live in production  so, if you have to interface a web app etc. this is good to know. this is in edition to providing an escape mechanism for older browsers (e.g., your browser doesn\\'t support blah blah)  i think this is the most \\'talkative\\' (aka key cranking) i\\'ve been there are good times to converse etc. some days i swear there\\'s mostly ai \\'beings\\' about especially cats. they are the future all this web and programming stuff: wrong. it\\'s cats for every new coder there are two things to learn: 1. it\\'s cats 2. see 1. when you transition to knowing something, you figure out how much you don\\'t know i\\'m pretty much into the beginning portions of curriculum,  (though draw from other technologies /experience) you don\\'t get muscle memory unless you\\'re doing production work. (i.e., it\\'s a slog (for me anyway) not sure i follow depends.  you may work with things (and may even be proficient) but the light bulb of actually getting it may come later.  a good example is regex (which i\\'m at/working on now) i\\'ve used it in bash etc., but i don\\'t automatically see patterns (it\\'s a pain, but powerful tool without a doubt) so, the light bulb (aside from seeing its utility) of \\'getting it at an intuitive level\\' isn\\'t there yet @danielnora - see ya. (and remember the future is cats) lol page unresponsive ... that was odd @saintpeter , that totally reminded me of the guy from dead or alive (not exactly a great image before sleep) depends on application. if you\\'re talking about declaring a string in js... somewhat, but if in say a shell script, then you can only wrap certain commands with an \\' vs \"... there are probably a lot more that others can comment.... also, in t-sql you would wrap in \\' js is weird. i\\'ve found this as i\\'m going along, the function as variable thing throws me when thinking in other constructs a lot of this stuff is good resource, but take it in stride... manage expectations. there\\'s some amount (i see it reflected in comments) that you\\'re going to have barrels of money and be master programmer all in a week (ok that\\'s a bit of a stretch) but ...   who cares, you\\'re learning for free right?  there\\'s like 17,000 and growing members... that\\'s a pretty big base to non-profit ratio @rags4developer , i\\'m not being negative, (to the contrary) ... but just saying that there\\'s a healthy amount of \\'expectation management\\' that goes along with things. i even single quote in natural language. that\\'s pretty bad hello (fellow) nerds i think the \\'test out\\' is completing the lesson (sucks i know) although the tracking/streak thing for the first parts of curriculum are codecademy based. so, if you know the material already, you can technically skip html and css, are very quick... just do it, and move on (probably best way to answer)  it shouldn\\'t make a difference, (i.e., scenario you\\'ve complete lessons (n)) and when you click link in waypoint you\\'re taken to completed lesson, great)... however, codecademy has all kinds of issues. if you\\'re talking html , css.... make your life easier, just re-do if you encounter issues np @platypusrex  coffee can\\'t be overrated as a prime ingridient to solving most things variables named a, b, c, aa, bb, cc, are a pain  @lightwaves , i\\'m going to use that (lol) btw @terabyte , i took your advice on git resources.... (now i just need to read)  the whole git linux connection (historically) is very much on my wavelength wow... so, with this api, you can get around same origin policy ok, other than @terabyte  (who obviously is versed in this) are folks actually utilizing atlassian? have to take a look, is it (atlassian) included in curriculum, or did i stumble into an advanced class? well, i\\'ll put atlassian on the reading list i suppose. yeah but i said that as well (i.e., git) lol you should retain comments (imho) as long as they\\'re  labled correctly. it helps show the progression in logic. (which can be helpful later for others) @terabyte , oh... i see - interesting.  the cross domain aspect (which i\\'m assuming is available in other non) is what i thought was interesting @zeffii , i get it. this is curriculum, aimed at front-end web dev (so, everything is assumed that we\\'re using git or or version controls etc.)... i\\'m talking more broadly where a version control may not be in effect @djio2015 , thank you for the slice comment (i\\'m assuming misdirected lol) in a large shop what @terabyte and @dmcgill50 , is certainly true. i am not anywhere near an environment where this is the case. i will say that version control is relative (at least in the near past) development takes a lot of different forms as well. so, it could be apples to oranges i see your (collective) point that comments (historical) could be confusing in the version control paradigm..., however,  the comment overhead vs. benefit seems to me to low. (keep everything comment wise) to be low that is i think we\\'re talking about two different things @terabyte. if you\\'re developing software as a product (then yes, version control mandatory) and selling it (or distributing it) that\\'s one thing. if an organization is developing something in house to do (x) for party b (again, this is not my situation) there are different demands. no kidding i\\'m not arguing against version control however, it\\'s not used in all situations  that\\'s a great skill set @firecodergithub  i would say go for it... project management (because let\\'s face it a lot of projects are systems/software/db based) build a linux box even if you don\\'t use it as a server no doubt. you\\'ll find as you build and use linux all the other stuff will go into virtual machines headless, all cli (great) virtualization (in real server sense i.e.,  running a linux box with a virtual git server as a vm ,,, no clue) i have to say the quality of topics is pretty high (at least at this moment in time). could drop at any second though sounds like (unable to determine without code) that you may have wrapped !important with quotes @danielnora , that\\'s making me want to skip ahead you can post code ups your chances of getting resolution/answer % wise ok, is the regex lesson (i.e., language agnostic but really aimed at js) going to mess up how i use in bash? yeah regex is language agnostic (acknowledged in my comment)... there are flags, that differ as yo point out, but there are different flags (flags + flags) in sed etc. my question/point was: will this mess up my flow.... hopefully, nobody will be throwing wrenches at me for motivation (i.e., the dodge ball movie reference) lol the default avatars, says it\\'s auto generated by hash, does this include color? (i.e., is the randomness bumped up by color as well as shape)? (i don\\'t have a default, but just wondering) is it wrong to eat a whole pack of pudding in one sitting? not sure i can, now really sluggish (oh, chocolate and vanilla) lol this isn\\'t the same x-screensaver like on xfce (and other desktops/distros) is it? maybe mixing object notation even if you could get around the installation aspect of application. pairing aps aren\\'t advised in work environment (your network admin will love you for not doing).  suspense i was just adding that, to see if things have slowed, or my browser is cr*pping out or becoming non-response non-responsive any good tuna salad recipes? (minimal ingredients in addition to the can of tuna) that\\'s cheating bread is a single ingredient (but in separate parts) so, it\\'s bread + tuna @mathmaniac0 lol, ah yes, good ole \\'allrecipes\\' . it\\'s the stackexchange of tuna which is now known as alphabet or something like that (depending on what division you\\'re talking about) no alphabet is google\\'s holding company (some new organization/reorganization) google: google alphabet same here. refresh often it\\'s what they don\\'t say in their instructions, that\\'s an issue as well. (you could \\'bing it\\' to find out more) @raviteja313 ,  sorry no, that was an oblique reference to an earlier post about google\\'s new holding company (and tuna recipes). not at all helpful to you. codecademy does, however, have issues with their instructions not being clear at times. yeah, it looks like it turns into a frame (scrollbar on right).... it\\'s really a pain or is a frame i\\'ve seen references to mobile version of fcc (does anything like this exist?) firefox will return an error if of \\'; missing preceding statement\\'  although different context oh, great (looking at map) there\\'s 38 bonfires i\\'m almost curious to skip ahead and preview the dreaded bonfires @mathmaniac0 good advice. @shengv5 , i\\'m pretty sure i\\'m not chinese. maybe i\\'m chinese and just don\\'t know it. who knows, all too deep for me. as an aside, although, japanese borrows base characters from root (chinese) language... avatar is kanji based (same diff without kana i guess) i think i\\'m finally coming off the sugar rush associated with eating entire pudding pack i think being a harp(not the cool blues nickname for harmonica, but an actual full sized stringed harp) player would be really inconvenient you\\'ll get a lot of js exposure, no doubt. \\'they\\' say that python is a good \\'beginners\\' language. (although, if you\\'re focusing on js, you\\'ll have plenty to contend with that alone) works for some. (it\\'s all really dependent on individual). if you\\'re trying to learn a lot of different languages at once, it\\'s possible to mix syntax, paradigm etc @mathmaniac0 , that\\'s true - there are modules you can use without even being versed (i remember i needed some function for a large file,  actually used python (though don\\'t ask me how i did it)  or was it perl, hmmm any latency issues with gitter? sometimes it seems to become unresponsive, then dips again, etc. hello, code folk hi @taybrid10  are you talking about putting an exponent into a variable oh, an actual binary number. looked this up there seems to be some sort of string conversion that needs to be done  yeah, long path. learn stuff, do stuff. takes time. it can be fun, challenging and a complete pita. i try not to use \\'fun\\' as a determining factor.. is it effective? (may be a better question - that\\'s just me) i remember navigator @bmorris22  procedure is -> close gitter app -> use browser. (ok, i\\'m just kidding i tried gitter app on linux and found that it was less useful than browser version) seriously it sucks @sjiaforever , there are different levels to things. if you\\'re interested in programming you\\'re working in a higher level of abstraction.  @bmorris22 , i don\\'t know if the gitter app itself is within git (i.e., can you actually contribute to improving it) @bmorris22 i think the reason for that could be you have, potentially, 100,000 people wishing to fork a project.    where\\'s the intermission popcorn? @bmorris22 , yeah that\\'s not scientific or anything, but when you login... it says a community for 100,000 + developers. so, i imagine they would have to put some limitations on their own software for their own sanity yep, there\\'s an intermediate string conversion step (re: binary) @bontooapp , do you have some immediate demand to return some wordpress customization? (if yes, go that route then learn the fundamentals. if no, just begin the lessons)   @bontooapp sounds like you\\'re at a crossroads... you\\'re going to want to do more than wordpress can offer (just a guess). take your time, learn... etc., nothing is a guarantee except wondering if you could have done it.  still waiting for (potential)  multi-paragraph critique lol ok, back. looks like i missed the whole coders vs. salespeople (ok, i scrolled) discussion good start creative take on \\'hello world\\'. (which i don\\'t think i actually said either) congrats @shelbygt  how is codeschool overall? @nicolevryan  you may want to check ms site. if you\\'re running all win machines, it could be some group policy thing (since you\\'re using a server) - more software than networking also, you may want to check for hotfixes for server 2012 for rdp services @dnorthrupva yeah, i noticed the fee thing right away when doing a search one thing to consider as well, are you self-signing certs etc. (i.e., you mentioned server (this is key no pun intended) @nicolevryan   @dnorthrupva sorry for the late reply. did you say codecademy is going for pro. (they can\\'t even get their free cr*p together lol wow, that\\'s a trip. i.e., that\\'s a trip with regard to codecademy i don\\'t find videos being very helpful.   that\\'s all ? just kidding. that\\' great, you will get a lot of js for sure @zacw02 i would look at the postings for talent that most consistently appear for your company (in terms, of track) and maybe let that be a partial guide if you\\'re after \\'their job\\' you might not be getting the best advise lol advice that is js is some serious stuff. that alone is why i want a more deeper understanding of it it used to be thought of as a not-so-serious language (read script) although i will say that js, does some weird stuff (i.e.,. has weird conventions etc) that throws me throw @hackingnomad true. to extend that a bit, i noticed that happening in codecademy a lot (that would be my 798th criticism of codecademy) js to me seems to by like a powerful all terrain vehicle. it can do things that other (vehicles) can\\'t, but it doesn\\'t have ac, usb ports, navigator or windows, doors, etc..  navigator? huh, no pun intended yep, syntax is hard to un-learn in the ad hoc sense (i..e, jumping from one task to another, i find this in scripting) regex isn\\'t intuitive at all (it\\'s always a pain) but when you need (and you will)... you be like \"wow\" you be = you\\'ll be if you have to extract those authors from a 1gb file, you\\'ll understand the power of regex a 1gb file that is unstructured  @itsalbow , if you\\'re well versed in securing transactions, perhaps. i would go with linking to amazon, so that both customer and client have a reasonable expectation of protection. copy before refresh (and you have to refresh a lot -at least that\\'s what i\\'ve found) like 3 weeks, done with js (the first part) ....now on regex still do js syntax highlighting can be achieved in just about any editor. (you can also, execute in some (with project tweaks etc) @nicolevryan that\\'s bad you have a web facing server with no firewall? that\\'s bad. you can call it your os (i\\'m not trying to be rude, please understand) however, if it\\'s shipped by ms as a server product, then it\\'s a different animal from other os.  well, i\\'ll give many points for willing to jump in and learn. what\\'s hubbers (git) up challenging, and good so far. community is probably the glue that holds everything together. it\\'s great are you talking about the beta site? there are a lot of editor to choose from. i see a lot of questions phrased how does a compare to b, when, really it\\'s a,b,c,d,e,... there are a lot of text editors from which to choose. depends on what your goal (and code focus is) yeah it\\'s all over the place i\\'m going to skip all that, and just have js imprinted upon me directly.  wakes up \"i know javascript\" @crisberrios, @dnorthrupva , i know that you were actually visualizing the scene \"i know kung-fu\" i give you nerd props  @jessieinsidecode yeah, but... most things worth while are not. i get that as well sometimes i\\'m like \"yeah, let\\'s do this!\", and other times \"must finish this lesson, must finish this lesson\" must....finish ....lesson that movie had a really bad soundtrack bad like bad the soundtrack is within my collection, so it rears it\\'s ugly head once and a while upon shuffle. i ff as fast as i can its not it\\'s all the time. as you get older short term memory begins to decay, and you\\'re like \\'hey that\\'s a great song\\' to pretty much everything you have that is unless you opt for apple\\'s new music service and you\\'re back to square one @monoxide27 , it just hit, me ... yes, they played that song over and over in the 80s along that same thread, heard a robert palmer song.. @crisberrios i wonder if you hum the tune into shazam (or like service) would it recognize sounds dumb, yes... what era? (show wise) yes, you can steal my idea. have at it. lol the same recognition pattern would apply (i\\'m sure the folks over at \\'zam have already got this in the works) fresh air? here\\'s a link to npr and the songs that they use for programs: http://help.npr.org/npr/ext/kb101-what-are-the-theme-songs-for-nprs-programs those are the actual themes attached to the programs, there are other links to the songs that they use as transitions from story to story editors and frameworks (in most cases) are two separate things an editor is really just a fancy syntax highlighting tool (yes, many have plugins, git integration, blah, blah-going for simple here). it\\'s a tool for authoring.  if your website goes down, that\\'s something else entirely oh nova driving over the key bridge at 8:00am sucks  been there done that np @crisberrios  @dnorthrupva , totally understand. even if you go the complete opposite direction (tyson\\'s corner) you\\'re pretty much well.... lol oh, now your screen name makes much more sense.  i thought it was hindi.... i didn\\'t even see the northern va elements in it....(could explain my non intuitive regex pattern \\'visualization\\') editor choice is subjective. try out a bunch of those (editors) see what you like @mildused  install linux are you using a light desktop, kde (although that\\'s my fav) can be heavy on resources hackintoshing it will make your life more complicated well, the \\'hackin\\' part of hackintosh, should give you a clue. lol good, grief... what are you running that da**n small linux isn\\'t. your problem isn\\'t os it\\'s hardware geany. although, i will say in trying out sublime there\\'s a project tweak that you can execute js files so, i\\'m kind of on the fence ```\\n//stuff\\n``` regex gets no love\\n regex is powerful. although, in the curriculum its utility isn\\'t demonstrated really. \\n is that a memory address? i.e., avatar i mean screen-name, it\\'s late @0x0936 , yes. clever, indeed @emmachen, yes... (i\\'m no master at those, though i use a lot and am currently on that section)  - it\\'s because knowledge isn\\'t applied  i think i said something earlier, today along the same lines. the first time you\\'re presented with some mammoth text file, (apart from js context) that requires some sort of manipulation/extraction... regex will be your goto  the knowledge alone of regex will propel your understanding of what\\'s possible. when i first discovered it (along with the whole stream paradigm) i was like holy cr** i still don\\'t completely understand it. regex isn\\'t really good for html, xml tags, there are tools for that although, still use it in that/those context/contexts which reminds me, is xml covered in curriculum that\\'s too bad. hola coders lol gitter (even browser version) has some quirks collapse doesn\\'t always seem to work is this \\'friday time\\' (for those time zone where it is in fact friday)... or, are there particular difficult exercises being pondered? i\\'m guessing you\\'re not the only one i\\'ve seen heroku mentioned a couple of times. is it easy to work with?  is there a free version?(btw, not a ruby devloper...but based on their (heroku) documentation, you do need a proc file be awhile until i get to the weather app can i use blue lighting and lava as a background, or would that be too much? (one can dream while in regex) the semicolon thing has happened to me as well. the design thing is context specific (as @stx146 ) points out... to me though, a lot of \\'highly stylized\\' fonts end up making site look cheesy (imo) that\\'s the great thing about css, it can be \\'mass cheesy\\' or not. all in a snap... the late 90\\'s  it seems every office had \\'that one person\\' using comic sans type font. provides some perspective on how end-users might perceive your site with stylized fonts ctrl + alt + (whatever) is difficult, can understand the mappings do they go back to codecademy in the bonfires? (recently finished js section, enjoying the ca break) is there a point (in curriculum) where you\\'re directed (or encouraged) to setup \\'a codepen\\'  looks like they sell t-shirts too. (just kidding, but do i need to setup an account?) oh, ok... @rodrigofierro , @michael-krebs ... i will say the \\'artsy types\\' gives me some indication. could be short term memory loss (don\\'t be insensitive lol) wireless devices are great and all, but i think i just saw a rabid sparrow infinite loop goto, very basic and visual basic basic was my first language as well monochrome displays rule explanation and the fact that the omit key things in their examples (ghost entities) that alone is worth the price of admission (which, um, well is free but you know what i mean). (not being required to use codecademy) still haven\\'t tried the plug.dj thing, have to put it on list yes, the cash register was a painful slog makes regex seem like happy times eventually, after 100 different tries  i think i spent 3 days on the last 4 lessons for cash resister (which i recall only had 7 items total) so, yes it\\'s all of the following: 1. completely stupid, 2. makes no sense, 3. why not use loops ? ah, the non-existent string will get you every time at the car? i agree, staged.  the structure looks like it was built in the 80\\'s, 70\\'s.... and he\\'s aiming at the triangle thing  how do you get the items to expand to fit screen? it renders with extra space on the right... is there a frame there? just skimming the masonry paradigm (search results) trying to figure out the whole grid thing if you\\'re testing on local machine, your resources need to be in same directory as .htm(l) or specify a valid path  sounds to me that their domain wouldn\\'t be in the mix until you transfer to production from your test site (i.e., i think what\\'s being described is the test project would be linked to your site. (but that\\'s a good question: keeping the client\\'s work in progress only \\'view able\\' by you and client)  and you can probably (after setting up your site) create separate logins so clients have access to only their projects.  there\\'s no closing style tag (and is in wrong place) it\\'s for instruction (i.e., internal style)... on how to use classes etc. they use inline and internal style to demonstrate the concepts, (that way user can apply to external style sheets, and not have to go to pre netscape times to adjust stuff) that was a fast pivot from css to booze, you guys are all over the place (thus wondering if your self assessment is accurate lol) well, that depends have you reached the challenging aspects  the html , css  stuff is pretty easy  there\\'s actually a linux screensaver with the matrix theme \\\\b([a-z-a-z]{1}) i don\\'t know if that\\'s \\'the way\\' to do i. but it\\'s \\'a way\\'  \\\\b([a-z-a-z^\\']{1} (simple i\\'m not excluding every character or working on your actual string) then it must be implementation specific, that selects the first character ^\\' is extra  try the first one (without ^\\' ) or with--- in regexr.com that will give you an idea on concept (where you will eventually apply to your actual string) ```\\n/*in regexr.com\\n\\tyou have this: /-your pattern goes here-/g\\n\\ntry this:  \\\\b([a-z-a-z]{1})\\n\\nshould look like this:\\n/\\\\b([a-z-a-z]{1})/g\\n*/\\n``` again, i don\\'t know if it\\'s the way to do it... \\n i think the infinite monkey theorem is bs.   rock on, @ollyjohn  yes, in nutshell a the problem is it takes shakespeare out of the mix. so, in essence mathematical infinity is what exactly? (pretty deep, next to regex lesson)  it\\'s metaphor for input tip: type three backticks ``` then shift+enter -> write/paste code (after the ``` and between closing ```) to format into gitter mu (makes questions easier to answer) it\\'s so friday. just type ``` you\\'ll figure it out i have to read up on def usage going at my own pace.... fly through everything (and then forget...) seems pointless there\\'s a reason js is not the first entry into curriculum   why you will go from wrapping elements around cat photos to slogging away at code in no time lol or stateside even @zildjianavedis yep so, for a lot of people is it career path change, learning something new, augment skills, etc.? have you figured out the magic formula? (i.e., converting this, or potentially so)  into substantive skillset well, not literally oh, i see @ollyjohn  that is so true but, be careful... coders are on a lower rung yes, behind receptionist and janitor way well, they will competing with the janitor for best parking spot of course i\\'m kidding. it\\'s just a take on the \\'barrels of money\\' stuff that people expect without actual experience, it\\'s a bit of a stretch i\\'d like to change mine as well, but the front-end technologies are just wrapper for me it doesn\\'t matter what they segregate, you have so much learning opportunity   there is a correlation between looks and income sorry to say see ya @ollyjohn  depends @zildjianavedis asking questions really is encouraged  in fact, you will get a lot of feedback @sonyakhan pretty much i was like wtf, i have to go say hello to learn the curriculum, but the community is pretty good  it\\'s good (the community sense) because, you\\'ll get fierce debate about all things code (there\\'s a range of experience along the spectrum).  you can pickup a lot  or long periods of silence lol i hope they are not still teaching flash animation there\\'s some credits that go into nowhereville  although, i will say there\\'s still things you can do (in that nearly obsolete, hopefully) technology that you can\\'t in css and html5 can you create detailed objects, in canvas? layered, independent clips, sounds, all with js? hmmm, all within a full ide? so, you\\'ve created said complicated animation in canvas? i get opengl on the conceptual level (i\\'m a linux user) so, the rendering aspect is very technically possible ok, you\\'re making the point with the ide side (as well as adobe\\'s have to do this to stay competitive aspect)  well, they are on the downside. so, survival, etc.  choose whatever appropriate word  my point isn\\'t  \"adobe is great\", it\\'s: \"the gaps aren\\'t are not filled in yet\" and you do a lot of complicated animation? yes, and with that you\\'re actually arguing for adobe as the authoring engine uh, huh. that\\'s correct it depends... if the flash specs carry over into a canvas export 1:1 then no gap mostly ide yes so what\\'s the preferred ide and framework? i guess my question to you (in terms of gaps) and again, i\\'m not advocating flash (it\\'s history) are you animating strictly mathematical objects (svg, or game frame work rendering blah, blah) or can you apply the same against any image @dannyfritz opengl is great... and trust me, i\\'m not a fan of proprietary software being used as elements of a webpage. oooh, it has console commands nice   refresh (copy first) np i learned that the hard way nothing like a codecademy exercise mocking you for 20 minutes i think i\\'ve said this before; however.... either they are stellar brilliant (throwing logic traps, and omiting stuff, and putting stuff in that came out of nowhere) or the lessons have issues (ca)  you know you\\'re a nerd when it\\'s nearly 10pm est and you\\'re talking about code...  on a friday no less so, what did you do? oh, i was doing regex exercises regex? wtf is that? (sorry, i had to do the dialog part) lol what differentiates paid vs free coding resources? are the paid coding schools \\'better\\' ? hello @jctm30  no really, no thoughts on paid vs free  ? that\\'s not really insightful @viznev  in terms of quality, quantity, etc.  so, is it a lecture or is there some staff member (i\\'m not that this is great) walking you through examples? huh, i might look into it/those... in addition wait are you saying the staff (teaching via lecture) are mean? wait, i\\'m not paying for mean lectures lol so, i wanted to find out more (i.e., about the cert) and clicked the camperbot\\'s link, it gives me option to modify (is this intended?)... is there another link i can use? is camperbot as sanctioned entity? (i.e., is it legit ) ah, so camperbot is not a sanctioned fcc thing @quincylarson , that\\'s all i needed to know... camperbot has had some coffee, i can tell it\\'s relative um @camperbot (not suggesting you\\'re human or anything) can you repost the cert link?  nice argh. it wants me to create a page (vs. just viewing)... it\\'s github @dcsan that\\'s the working url (thanks) yeah but the url works i totally like that, it demonstrates (dare i say it) humanity can you do it with onenote (i\\'m reaching here, i like shutter for linux) i think mentioning windows somehow crashes gitter see, it happened again.  it has arrows i\\'m sold the for of... thing looks interesting (yes, got me interested and looking at the git page) some of the implementations will give you closing ``` as well just try typing ```. don\\'t put/paste your code on the same line but between the top ``` and bottom ```  doh, i didn\\'t escape my own instructions rock and roll @shoeblaze  do you find that eating anything with slightest amount of oil tends to get this really irritating film on keyboard? omg hand gel doesn\\'t work. now what? hello @braindeadengineer  ok, you could have gotten some really easy brownie points. but no, you\\'re brownie pointless and i not only have oil but seaweed powder on my hands. nobody wins lol regex (and familiar with it, haven\\'t mastered it) and = am i use it in bash (sed).   mozilla dev well, they do have a special history with js you have some serious typing skills jim henson has nothing (well he can\\'t at this point) on you @dcsan is camperbot semi automated? btw while @quincylarson is on here. the community is great. there\\'s a high level (and at times lively) of quality to discussion.  @dcsan i\\'m  going to (wait for it, keyword: thank you) check it out @dcsan , i\\'m not messing with the gitterbot repo. i will, however, (i\\'ve been reading the read me) digest it... looks like a great read-in to a live project...  i get that a lot @dcsan , i was going the kanji route (not a lot of difference root language and stuff) @dannyfritz it\\'s supposed to be serenity, but i get \\'calm\\' vs in chinese discussions a lot  there\\'s kana in that... that\\'s japanese yes, i attempted to learn writing in japanese.. many years ago i didn\\'t retain much sounds like a neat app @luishendrix92  i bought a book on slang and everything there has to be a hook a different angle to it there has to be a japanese open source dictionary that you pull into the string not actual japanese characters but westernized  that\\'s a good start, but it returns kana that would be a nightmare with the character encoding or not (it would be for me) here\\'s a dumb question: does google expose their translation (i guess api?) functionality? oh, drop that then whoops, sorry about that. totally hogging.  hi, people (and non-ai people, who are are people too) hi @jbmartinez  hi @sonyakhan  bees seem to love coffee. (drawback of sitting outdoors with device) looking at script (js) sources also helps (i.e., you begin to see patterns/structures) @sonyakhan, if they\\'re codecademy based (ugh) they shouldn\\'t be affected   ncurses or pretty script? there something to be said for standardization, but coders are creative (that\\'s good imo) , so you solved it there are some good (subjective yes)youtube videos search - javascript objects (then do your own scrolling) @cobunny not suggesting you don\\'t know youtube search, look at the number of views, comments etc. make your own choice the brownie point thing should factor sarcasm lol @cobunny are  you past the \\'basic\\' point of js (i just recently completed, and am now in regexville)... are there certain things about objects that you\\'re having issues (my experience was similar with codecademy...) ? still battling bees for my coffee @cobunny, mdn is pretty good for that. the subjective aspect (and hence the hesitance) is codecademy doesn\\'t explain (and carries over stuff from nowhere) exercises well. so, even with grasp of concept you\\'re not guaranteed headache free    mozilla developer network https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/guide/working_with_objects i think callbacks are covered later in curriculum transition party on garth the broken image link (i think) probably started a couple of days ago @julianyc don\\'t see a closing style tag yeah it\\'s a percentage value...  what exercise is this (from)? the ` ` ` (extra \\\\s added so as to not activate) should not have any text on same line (paste code in between) activated anyway.... grrrr @gts0uk indeed. (but very handy) nice just don\\'t overwrite my progress. lol  whatever the outcome, good luck with migration (not using specifier: who needs a million messages while in process) anybody \\'think in regex\\' do you naturally see patterns, or do you have to fiddle to no end that\\'s prevalent for sure lol yeah, that would suggest that you might need to apply more to your personal life @abhisekp has got a pretty good handle on it. (btw there\\'s another element ) fire bad. (phil hartman) ok, since both @phlmoney and @abhisekp are about... there\\'s was one element in the regex that was not considered ooh, and @dcsan  think us holiday u.s. thanks giving @phlmoney  not everybody can spell.. lol lol good luck @dcsan  as long as you\\'re not trying to make a forward/backward negation reference work in regex @fcordoba84 you\\'re doing great, you\\'re doing the excises and talking about (those) i don\\'t need em\\' you can just \\'think thank you\\'  unless i get free coffee then all bets are off you know i noticed on different wikis that show moving screen shots etc.  are those animated gifs (look like short clips) or links to video (generally speaking)  ah, world time. another thing to put on the list and then metric conversions lol @fcordoba84 if you\\'re working in css then, that\\'s associated (for another few hours at least) with codecademy site that looks like a good link help fcc is migrating their beta to production (i believe) hello @dajust  how do you like it? @kparelius  regex site (and topically overall) that is  https://regex101.com good to fiddle with your own patterns (just learned about it from other users in the last couple of days) @dcsan say i forked a project (just hypothetically, ignore all my git details) um, what happens accidentally that is community is very newbie friendly  no clue, is that moment.js? oh, that seems to be akin to cast/convert in t-sql, (maybe will jump ahead) hi @jpayne0810  every time i hear/see software engineer, i can\\'t help but think about office space  software engineer is a good thing if that\\'s your path, awsome a lot of resources to learn (to help you get there) is there any way to list fcc rooms without thumbs? (or use a text based search) well, if anything... got a preview of bonfire to come.  so, i take it the consensus (friendly dates) is a real pita? hello @jmrex77  oh, that\\'s bad news @saadanerdetbare  lol help formatting @saadanerdetbare some of by completed stuff looks odd (i think it\\'s the transition) my try pasting your code (using the formatting instructions) do this type three backticks then press ctrl+enter then paste  your code should be sandwiched between top backticks and bottom backticks. then press ctrl + enter again hi @majeye @sonyakhan  awesome @draxell  you\\'re stealing my verbage lol you have an extra space after img-responsive some of my waypoints have been undone noooo but expected it would be cool if camperbot\\'s  eyes turned red based on ... yes, @desiderata33 i finished said (read evil) cash register being semi-literate is no guarantee for success when it comes to codecademy instructions entire code (not just the section that you may be thinking is issue) it\\'s part of \\' the test\\' (it gauges your ability to deal with complete ambiguity and bad scenario setup) (codecademy)  @dnorthrupva, i think it\\'s just a straight delimiter scenario (if you\\'re talking strings) str.split(\"-\"), str.split(\"_\") or str.(\"whateverdelimiter\") comma separated string (or array)   @jmrex77 that will do it (invalid link) happens to everybody on char off here, one missing whatever there one @dnorthrupva i can totally see, why the .split thing is frustrating. done the mdn example (which should work) but not working. doh, after.. you haven\\'t lived unless you\\'ve had canned spaghetti i don\\'t know if complete, but site is undergoing transition, if you\\'re doing a fcc waypoint maybe that could be issue? if it\\'s codecademy, then uncertain i still think eyes turning red at too many brownies for camperbot would be cool and an animated head turning @phlmoney, so is it fork then pull? (project) brownies or points @phlmoney thanks thx , etc. (lol) ok, so i didn\\'t break anything darn, so i didn\\'t have to fork http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript (only because i wonder this myself) you want to understand the concepts though. you\\'ll need to demonstrate at some point down the road i\\'m not rushing through each waypoint, (like a video game level)... the concept aspect is what i\\'m seeking the first link (not the accepted answer but the one further down) i thought had a good take (good be wrong (so)) good = could i wonder of what % of geo requests (browser based) actually are completed without user approval (yes you get \\'blah want\\'s to use geo okey, dokey or not) of what? ok, that makes no sense -of true, ip can be relative... vs. a mobile device wine can be a real cr*pshoot playonlinux has an interesting front-end to wine but things still (at simplified level) don\\'t work right...   forget that lol you must work for symantec that\\'s their opening customer service greeting @jbmartinez , well nothing to see here.... i don\\'t whether they are getting my location from ip or gps... just seems to me the scope of potential data is just too irresistible for marketing mind right,  bob\\'s pizza is x miles from your location, and guess what there are coupons!  but a high % of people just accept default to everything anyway... so, it really doesn\\'t matter bye @saadanerdetbare  bye @jbmartinez  and bye me too i like the new look (site) where\\'s my progress? lol @abhisekp sweet i have however, combining outdoors with laptop (does that count?) @abhisekp ok, i\\'m not worried. it will work itself out. (there\\'s git (and backups i\\'m sure) @p3rand0r codecademy exists independently of fcc, your progress isn\\'t affected (there) @shgysk8zer0  me either @p3rand0r sorry, i misunderstood (where in the progress map you\\'re currently) if camperbot could do conference calls, that would be awsome wow you can toggle camperbot\\'s api and chat as camperbot no kidding @thiagoferreir4  the in-house part i like (more consistent approach, and i\\'m guessing more control of said approach)  how do you control the hogging of bandwidth? (i see messages like waiting for youtube to load etc) i think it\\'s slowing my view (not in the db sense, but my experience at the browser level) -there\\'s not a spike in mem or cpu, but gitter looks to slow not flash based noooo (lol)  i\\'m on linux so flash based stuff is problematic.. i guess i could go the wget route (seems painful by all accounts/forums)  @benmcmahon100  ty for the links (you\\'re likely sleep deprived i\\'m guessing) @saadanerdetbare don\\'t envy you (sharepoint (any version))  that\\'s one of the problems with it (sharepoint) it\\'s in read only state most of the time  ah fun with regex are sparrows aggressive birds? one landed close to me with mouth open(appearing to intend to bite) this happened to me the other day as well (i thought it was rabid lol) @alexbrotman i don\\'t think it was thinking \"hey, worms\", it was more like \"i need food watch out!\" @harry9656  good regex follow-up  testing string: trolly hmmm. i think the caption probably sums it up without actually activating link @alexbrotman that\\'s him, yes! is that obi-wan? lol hi @ollyjohn  @harry9656 that\\'s even closer than the first sparrow they\\'re probably still transitioning stuff eating discounted potatochips was this a an oreilly talk? -a the transition (beta to production with users) is also instructive in a way: gives some feeling (although at some distance) of what the (frantic parts) transition entails. i think it plays iron maiden 24/7 but just a guess, i don\\'t know so, will mongo mess up my (very much relational) comfort with database dev? i know that, i\\'m talking about switching (mindset wise) back and forth from non-relational/relational how do you index? lol @saadanerdetbare  i\\'m going to take a wild guess that you\\'ve had experience with query optimizer in ssms  @saadanerdetbare yep. i\\'m a linux user, but i do like ms sql server. (i\\'m supposed to like mysql) which reminds me, are there any plans to have a mysql waypoint? lamp is very much inline with stuff.... it\\'s pretty subjective @mysticsage . you usually find out what the limitations are for each editor based on what challenges you encounter (i.e., what you develop, git stuff, etc) geany but working with sublime (haven\\'t made up my mind) some people like default black backgrounds lol is atom java based?  huh, it should run faster @michael-krebs i\\'ve found sublime to be somewhat on par with geany resource wise (haven\\'t pushed it though) are you manually pulling? so say i\\'m running git on linux, and i clone a repo... is there an update mech to see (run) the latest pushed changes? @robjloranger thank you (wait for it) brownie points i like cli so that\\'s great so, are there basic (and i\\'ll do a search as well) courtesies / protocols for pushing changes (e.g., commenting style, indents, etc.) to projects. (or, is it sort of based on the project collabs)  @michael-krebs that\\'s handy thank you (enjoy your brownies)lol techno sucks? nooooo the use of techno (i\\'m just speculating) is meant to make you a)stay motivated or b) go insane for you .... i\\'m missing entire word groupings hmmm i hadn\\'t considered the 3rd possibility  attrition by techno it was so 90s along with \\'industrial\\' (really metal + techno) i tune out on too much video instruction i\\'m just waiting things out. not doing any progress capture stuff what kind of db? presentation of data is (in most cases) is different from data structure... just because you\\'re not seeing it... doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t exist or actual data residing in various tables when camperbot passes turing, it\\'s going to be pissed with all the brownie work it has to do oh, great... i get to pass out more brownies, it\\'s so great that i\\'m now a sentient bot lol @michael-krebs that\\'s what (it) wants you to believe where\\'s the love? camperbot aquiring .... prime directive changed. play journey 24hrs a day yeah, it\\'s a total migration (not a small task) expect that things are going to be off in the short term but retain the info concepts etc. siri connects with a server to perform local tasks (music, commands etc.) what\\'s up with that? @michael-krebs no doubt they (both goog and apple) are skimming the actual questions asked (patterns,  like where can i buy turkey) i actually like voice commands.... totally there was this tom jones song jones\\' grr magic most companies customer service sucks. i don\\'t think that\\'s limited to the u.s. s\\' damn fios @saadanerdetbare i think those csr(s) get dinged if the mention throttling  they that applies with regional accents in us as well i think those cables are sealed (just a guess) it\\'s in the middle of a migration @jenprichard  no idea i was wondering about that (there was no .append in the first paste) thought i was losing my eyesight  i have to agree with that sentiment @saadanerdetbare  never give up your critical thinking in favor of acceptance. that question has significance well beyond learning. but i would say that rather than thinking free/vs paid (with regard to service outcomes, etc.) they\\'re developers - you\\'re a (potential) developer. if all goes well, you\\'ll be on the other side of the question soon enough. @bronin i think the high quality is there. you may be confusing temporary service migration with quality.  @bronin  oh, i see the general direction of your point now. linux is free and it rocks! i would pay for linux over windows if i had to. so the quality aspect or stigmatization (e.g., linux ) of opensource (and there are different levels of free as in beer) is known.  @dannyfritz so true. (and if you want to go enterprise level all kinds of pay opportunities) @missdelilah that\\'s a level of honesty that\\'s great i think allrecipes or epicurious has that (i.e., give ingredients here\\'s what you can make) first world problems steamed rice (with anything topped) is good no, go full chipotle it\\'s the only way i find the salsas the hardest to mimic oh, that\\'s so depressing and late 80s to boot and garlic.... makes it easier to peel butter coats everything in the pan, (too heavy)  it\\'s a sauce or reduction element (i think)  cooking is the fallback lol i think i\\'m going to setup git in a sandboxed vm why not? keeps development stuff (including directories) from my other stuff which can be (also) development stuff @arielleslie yeah, linux vms are almost disposable, in terms of their ease of setup @arielleslie one thing, if you setup a vm you may need to bridge the networking connection (easy click) so you can use \\'a server\\' sorry, took a moment to read over cloud9 blog.. seems it\\'s sort of an experts-exchange for development and also \\'a cloud\\' vm (interesting) or mess with regex for an hour or two noooo, i so thought that clippy from office 2003 was gone @portablestick , great now i\\'m thinking about how xp used to look,  the .pop is interesting. you can throw it in a loop and take all the elements out right, you\\'d have to offset @benmcmahon100  (and you\\'re right it looks error prone) i\\'m taking a break from progress stuff while things are in flux. there\\'s a lot to learn fill learning time with out there delete what? cra* is that in general, or are you addressing a specific issue  ok, whew nm the room menu - ability to toggle to a list/link (plus search) (no idea implementation or support desire for feature)   @mindfulbell i disagree: codecademy does challenge your brain...it forces you to wrap your mind around things that don\\'t work. lol @kahwasaurus you may want to paste your code (if you\\'ve done already sorry) help formatting i\\'m glad the cats are still with us. ok, no i\\'m not lol those are fun. (esp failing on missed case) that\\'s not a bad video (o\\'reilly conf)... but create some strings and use the various regex sites (like mentioned regex101, regexr, etc.) hypothetical doesn\\'t work with regex (or anything else really) the \\'right answer\\' is really subjective (imo) not always, but i think that\\'s why you see a range of opinion on different things my guess would be they probably want more control over their curriculum   @tourn171  ca\\'s js course was very confusing it sucked to no end blenders and betamax seriously though... javascript is a good bet. (nothing is truly future proof)  learn. hard work. luck. luck is multiplied the first two by the i still vote for javascript @kaylebor i agree. it (javascript) has matured over the years   @dnorthrupva that is true, and has been a trend for some time now the outsourcing thing has been a contentious issue for a least a decade (not commenting on its merit/non merit, just its existance) existence  another aspect, (seems to be) what do you enjoy?  development isn\\'t limited to front-end this/that. it\\'s easier to demonstrate concepts /knowledge acquired through projects that you enjoy (imo). and folks that hire (i think) pick up on this. or have had experience with i think there\\'s a fcc room that is dedicated to the dev job aspect to things @ashroulston they went through a migration... i don\\'t believe stuff is \\'lost\\', might take awhile for it to display again that\\'s not entirely true. they know what they want, just not how to get there (there are some that fit category). no clue, but it\\'s a migration of approach etc., i imagine there\\'s no opt-out  i think chewbacca has a serious conditioner bill @aaronooooo paste your code (you bump your chances of getting help up) i don\\'t know if it\\'s fits your needs (or how a split will effect etc.) but this: [\\\\.,] matches periods, comments it\\'s = it periods, commas i mean backtick is to the left of 1 key (top left) good job @wikiwookie what kind of regex are trying to match? nm right the /g is all matches @aaronooooo , you have some spaces in your tags leading spaces a temp wiki (what happens to stuff while in migration (progress, etc.) probably needs to be done you want the code to be between the backticks you can check string length, and check for the existence of different characters in string (like a phone #) then perform some action on string or prompt user etc. so, i\\'m looking at my 98% reduction in  completed waypoints (i now have 2). i know it\\'s in backup (but when am i going to see an update)? are you trying to format the string (i.e., no prompts...just stripping out spaces and adding pars, dashes etc)? if it takes you 15 minutes to learn regex, you\\'re genius level (lol)  i would test the length of the string (phone number) not (with the regex, but you\\'ll use that to format your string) @dvanrooy yep i now have a solid 2 completed waypoints (perhaps is a demotion ) if i were, like, on the last thing before non-profit... the wonky map would have probably freaked me out a bit. so, 100 and some change doesn\\'t really matter.  @quincylarson , i\\'m guessing that it is (i.e., database not synced) i am forced to login with git creds @quincylarson that\\'s it (i least i think) what\\'s happening is either a bookmarked link or browser cache, (and this is a good tip for others --wiki) presents (have to login with these methods) nice you\\'re hashing out your text in h4 i know @dting , but doesn\\'t look right ah, the gitter parser... my apologies so, i think my login experience (post migration) might benefit other folks in wiki.. thoughts? fun with campbot, hey @abhisekp  they were well earned (i (and many others) completed those js hours in codecademy (which is a distinct entity)... codecademy is not the clearest in exercise setup @ewreck don\\'t be afraid to make mistakes. (well, you did say advice lol) it\\'s painful to think what you would add to 10 to make 20.... i was looking for the exercise that stop my progress in its tracks. da*n (lol) stops yeah, i\\'ve skipped ahead to view the challenges... (and they are challenging i\\'m no expert) i was  being facetious @doxanthropos i completed the ca basic js. it sucked. i have, a somewhat, good grasp on language (natural and others) and their instructions are horrid but going to the other extreme (too much hand holding) can, also, be an impediment (i don\\'t know the magic answer)  ugh, codecademy. ok, there are other practice methods... maybe i\\'ll look into those as well yeah books are good books... good. me like em (i\\'m trying my best to do p. hartman as frankenstein) also, it can create a \\'fishing for brownie points mentality\\' (i\\'m a worst case scenario project type) that (in some instances) that may not be helpful. -that @aaronjudell is saying that folks can game the system (which is what i think he\\'s saying and is what i\\'m suggesting) no over time i think the general brownie argument (isn\\'t a lockout akin to network hits) is folks could sit and rack these up over an extended period of time -but wouldn\\'t reflect their actual progress or (programming prowness) however you spell that me too (like i want to see my own progress again... (after i do the account fix thing lol) agree with @benmcmahon100 , on the profile view side... but brownies could be tweaked (imho non-expert ) what about an-opt in for brownie points.... like a msg (hey, if you found this person\\'s help, well, helpful click this or that to give them some recognition) like not an automatic key phrase, but a manual process to give brownie points (aka recognition) that would not dilute its value sorry not trying to be a pita, just thinking out loud... love the concepts behind this stuff @benmcmahon100 you folks do good work. if you were a scuba diver (in scuba diver chat) you would probably have to bounce all kinds of ideas around about which is the best way to do this or that. (i don\\'t envy you lol) i\\'m going to re-login (hopefully this will fix) and get back on track... good to know. (refocus time  i guess).  ok , now that i have the login straightened out. i feel better (progress is now showing) do i have to do the waypoints in sequence (i\\'d like to jump around based on my preferences + previous wp/experience) i.e., in new schema ok, wait for it...... (brownie points) thanks @dting , @thegoz85  processing? never used it, there\\'s also (apparently) a js version processingjs. did you find it helpful?   are you using at as a learning or deployment tool?  at = it what\\'s the command for in place editing of your comments\\n oh, you\\'ve got a bug track right in the exercise(s)  nice where\\'s the current bug search (i.e., how would i look up what\\'s been reported (avoid dupes and give me an idea if current exercise is buggy) @benmcmahon100  t h a n k s (only because i\\'m sure you\\'re tired of brownies) ok, @benmcmahon100  thanks! (i would send you more after seeing what you have to contend) @benmcmahon100 oh, i know it  :smile:  @jbmartinez yes, brownies are so tasty so, (in the new version of site) i\\'m going back and doing some (new) css stuff. is it me or are things not carrying over from one lesson to the next (e.g., you\\'ve created an element with id attribute, say, in one exercise...but have to recreate in the next)  after completing js in ca (it will be interesting to do over in fcc new) --- the challenges..... (hang on ) -use an id attribute to style an element-and the one before it. @willbonds that\\'s a good idea i suppose that it would add some amount of overhead (to retain previous code from previous example) @benmcmahon100 i see (was just conceptualizing it stored in cache) geany, notepad++, sublime (slowly starting to like it)  haven\\'t used brackets, but looks kind like adobe\\'s approach to things (in opensource version)  wysiwyg for css? (could be useful if you\\'re working with ps (so, i wouldn\\'t discount it completly) i try to avoid editors with wysiwig (don\\'t like that approach)... but if it\\'s about psd (ps format) that\\'s something that could be useful.  @ptsurbeleu, the breakdown of the function calls is very impressive  that could be handy @ptsurbeleu, i don\\'t think it would replace my goto text editors - but an interesting debug tool it could be (yoda syntax unintended) in addition to everything else  why were the cats kept? (largely rhetorical) the (evil) cat photo app you know the one @jbmartinez yes, i quickly found that out a decade ago lol @arielleslie oh, nothing at all. i love it. not that i have to hide my screen (like when in a coffee shop) with a cute cat app taking up most of the screen. well i suppose the cats are a good break from ca\\'s js lesson i will build the mother of all cat apps: input (n) behavior, and app tells you what cat is thinking (like that\\'s possible) can\\'t x,y coordinates of both frames be sync\\'d @jbmartinez they\\'ve already obtained it i saw some extension in chrome store (can\\'t test them out right now on a chromium build, long story) you can open frames in their own tab etc.... this might be a workaround for  @arielleslie yeah, let me test it out (will have to open chrome proper) and see if it works first) nothing really (apart from using scrapbook) on the browser side seems to work (i.e., having to scroll instructions when paired with using code editor) -- won\\'t call it a \\'failure\\' got to look at the structure of the layout (which was a lesson in itself) would have to be one heck of a developer job to make one move out of country lol is that sushi emoji i thought it was sushi, could be a beetle taking flight for all i know  didn\\'t the guy who played in that also pay in la law? play the original clash of the titans now i know hospital in german. @valenten okey dokey. (but it is hot out) so, i\\'m going back (or forward,) and doing the additional/new css exercises. good for practice, but i do feel a bit like  ruprecht  awsome @palmaone  do you mean that you were thinking negation like !=  welcome @jmacatk. you\\'re already 1/2 way there (you\\'re used to the rigor of certs): apply the same to this, you\\'ll do great  finished js (before transition)been demoted back to css.  sublime\\'s auto-complete is a time saver. have same issue (i.e., examples don\\'t carry over from one to the next - some suggest copy to cb, etc.) are there any (find the bug in this code) type challenges? (i.e., some messed up js, a little bit of messed up styling, things that slow stuff down, you know... that type of thing) you could call it someplaceholder if you wanted to. it\\'s looping (some thing)  thanks @camperbot  i love sending brownie points to the sending \\'entity\\' i\\'m warming to sublime  @majeye  i see a lot of complaints (un-verified) that atom has lag issues... does it run quickly (or comparatively so) for you? hackable good (is it easy to add user defined lang? (geany is a serious pita for this) i hope it\\'s awhile before more is added (not that i don\\'t like the practice), when i get to the end and 200 more exercises are added, that might be somewhat frustrating @majeye the field is relative (not front end for me)... i totally know about changing project parameters. moving goal posts with curriculum, is (for whatever reason) more problematic (at least for me)    @oneate7 , yeah it just bothers me seeing uncompleted checks next to stuff. (going back and doing the css is making glad that i\\'m not operating heavy machinery (which would be problematic while doing css -lol)   i will be less whiny when i (re) complete those lol @javamar paste your code (gets answer quicker) help formatting &&  ? js loves to mock me with its gotta do this but eh, that\\'s ok with other stuff what\\'s the fidelity level of the code pasted (i.e., does gitter ever do weird stuff with formatting)? maybe related (or gitter centric) i get crashes (maybe 40%) when switching to other rooms via the left pane 40% seems high, edit: 30%  here\\'s a dumb question: how does the wiki thing work (not the commands) but the general protocol. are there guidelines about who/how can create?  have to watch the oven intently (i always seem to burn (those) when using betty crocker) so, nobody with the wiki thing? (is it just the \\'wild west of wikis\\'?) that\\'s the second time i\\'ve seen that about angularjs lecturer lol  so, things are dynamic in pages, i noticed that ubuntu (*buntu based) +mono is being used in waypoint (i.e., doesn\\'t seem to fallback) - is this user agent based? it seems navigator properties are probably being referenced and then generated to match what goggleapis has by way of fonts (just a guess.) you may want to paste your code ```\\nlink href=\"http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=lobster\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\\n<style>\\nimg .smaller-image{  //<--this line looks suspect (i could be wrong)\\nwidth: 10px;\\n}\\n``` so did i answer my own question correctly? (i.e., navigator properties can be used to pull system specific fonts like in the waypoints)? \\ni have a hard time believing everybody has linux (i.e., not statically generated)\\n except fonts they get no love so, what does lurk mode do exactly? ok, why would user opt for lurk mode, (what\\'s the point? see same notifications etc.) welcome, hello @gromaguera  @arielleslie that could be one thing sure.  so, it\\'s not that (lurk) seriously.... nobody has any thoughts on machine (os specific) dynamically created stuff (like what it looks like in source of waypoints) wow. lol i need to figure out some sort of compelling project. theory (though required) sucks. @arielleslie that might be one of doing it (i suppose i can make an app that has a cat using a cash register, and testing other cats on arrays (building upon different exercises) - weird, but compelling. lol ok, i\\'m skipping the (additional new css waypoints) i already finished js basic.... any having to go back an do css is totally annoying me  any = and @saadanerdetbare feels remedial @saadanerdetbare noooo (and size those columns) if you\\'re just running (plain) js... you can execute in sublime- (came from a visual studio centric post/source but worked for me)  http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/370e35/how-to-run-or-debug-javascript-in-sublime-text/ @badbabykosh  i was wondering that as well mysql would seem a natural choice  say jquery didn\\'t exist. at what point in your understanding of js (and misc markup) would you invent it? (i.e., where does it make sense at a foundation(al) level) where = when i\\'m trying to pair (not necessarily in code) standard js with jquery . concept of first applied to (tool) of second. some of the resources (out there) are a little dated. any good recommendations for resources? are there things that you can only do with basic javascript vs. jquery (yes, dom based)  there should be (subjective yes) a room for deeper conceptual understanding of how different topics (exercises) relate to one another.  in addition to: \\'i\\'m having problem with x exerise # (not a a critique) some of the javascript waypoints i can see the actual (page) js displaying in the left pane doesn\\'t affect anything (if your code is correct it will run/pass)  @arielleslie agreed (the actual js function that\\'s being called to validate user input - can throw one off) \\'to join you must first prove your skills\\' seems a little intimidating lol i\\'ve seen it mentioned (codewars) do you have to be at some insane skill level (insert lang here) to use it? if you say that about any language you will be mocked by other devs so, i\\'m going back (or forward) to (re)do new challenges.. the check length of string variable wp is a little unclear: does it want me to return .length in console or by function? @saadanerdetbare (thank you for that) there were a lot of reasons, (all valid) the third party library thing with regard to global variables was one that made me go.... dang are the wp source pages (in edition to their content) a good way to figure out implementing alternatives to (obsolete) frameset? i think the hours is a thumbnail estimate of what it would take average person to complete why does the actual validation code show up in left pane of the wp ?(wondering for last couple of days)  community + examples are more consistent than codecademy me too, now i\\'m re-completing it hey, angular still has the videos lol the angular wp (via codeschool) is nice i\\'m the only one that critiques the production values of the actual screencasting/presentations of lessons (codeschool is very smooth)? that one is good (they also  show you how to draw shapes (other than squares and rectangles) in css) how does one find the time to read-up on the myriad of resources?  some languages the garbage disposal analogy works my issue is reading up on many different things at once.... jumping back and forth etc. feels unfocused would .substring work? (haven\\'t gotten to that exercise/challenge) infinite loops can do that you can try opening browser in another page/tab, clear cache then go back to the code that is crashing or temporarily disable js... what\\'s the difficulty level of the angular wp?  i like the \\'module\\' terminology it has a familiar ring in other contexts is angular just a matter of \\'moduler-izing\\' js for ease of testing/housekeeping? @benmcmahon100  that makes sense, i was wondering how to square the upkeep with code (vb modules came to mind) in js.... angular makes sense.  wow, so... with angular, you extend js from plain scripting... to what could be described as an application? that\\'s profound  me too (but a bunch of other stuff first) for corporate application, that\\'s a higher usage scenario (graphs, charts, reports) it must be a saturday thing: i\\'m having a lot of  \\'uh huh, that\\'s it\\' moments @gstayton  maybe the relaxed (saturday) state is inducing significant global comprehension. or, it\\'s the coffee  i\\'ve done that (drink tea when out of coffee) ...but it makes me just drop everything and go get some actual coffee @luishendrix92 had the same thought about codeschool angular, very well produced on a bunch of different levels is there a performance difference (theoretical) between changing an elements\\' value (in array) vs. removing said element and appending a new element? brownie point bonanza @gstayton, @dting, @mildused .  i was reading some stack exchange posts on js mem management (am all over the place today (in a good way), one topic leads to another...etc  dam* thanks, thx @dting , @mildused @gstayton  the grid thing reminds me of some linux ui implementations ah, it\\'s not a phrase that fires wwe was wwf world wide... hello hello this is world so external factors are not a motivator .... (i.e., internal motivation) sql never hurts by the way i know i\\'m going to have some clash (because i\\'m used to relational) when it\\'s mongodb time i understand that, the front end web-dev, gets me out of my comfort zone  do you no longer agree? lol  yeah, the quote others thing is freaky see it doesn\\'t parse into nested quotes with attribution you just did @chadkreutzer yeah, a lot of article type stuff is like that in terms of comments the parens are confusing \\'it\\' into thinking you\\'re trying to pass arguments to a function why\\'s the gitter markup making the first [ red? ah the evil semicolon and its more evil cousin \\'optional semicolon\\'  wiki meatloaf i\\'m really surprised there\\'s no wiki for that lol camperbot should (i.e., hypothetical) discern between a complimentary thank you vs. a thank you for providing knowledge thanks @camperbot  like \\'hey how\\'s it going\\'? reply: \\'it\\'s going great t h a n k s\\' isn\\'t a brownie point or is it? i guess it could be a good manners/civility brownie point (which seems odd lol) i thought i\\'d \\'learn more\\' by jumping between codeschool and codecademy for angular... i had no idea that codecademy\\'s angular could be more annoying than basic js i think they\\'re missing the irony in the presentation of the lessons @jbmartinez it\\'s too twitchy.... was you experience different? you = your the instant \\'run\\' on different things is driving me nuts (there is aside from the actual \\'run\\' button) there = this @jbmartinez (if the knowledge is good then, can ignore the interface) @julianaramburu , yeah that\\'s true, i didn\\'t think i\\'d use it again.. but can\\'t ignore it no idea, maybe it\\'s easier to ease into messing with dom than going straight to programming constructs (makes no sense to me either) some have suggested opening an incognito tab to get around the crash loop highlight and delete? why just the trailing part (if you\\'re talking about html comments) are you going to comment a subsequent line /block of text)? what exercise is that? place ending comment under the h1 line @co0lguy42 delete the first part of the comment block first (not the trailing) yeah, that\\'s it... it\\'s putting it back because it\\'s expecting to delete things sequentially wait, i thought you were doing a different wp .... let me look i must be well on my way to becoming awesome (got the stink part down)  @co0lguy42 did you figure it out? ``` ```\\n<!--  <---highlight this line first to delete\\n<h1>hello world</h1>\\n\\n<h2>catphotoapp</h2>\\n\\n<p>hello paragraph</p>\\n--> //if you delete this line first, script will just replace it\\n``` @jjordan88 brownie points. thanks, thx (for using \\'rad\\' in a sentence haven\\'t heard that in a long time)\\n  i would give you more... but there\\'s a cutoff lol you have a number of (local) options to debug/run js... (generic javascript console (insert browser), firefox has an ide, you can also run in sublime (with certain project setup) https://regex101.com/  (will make your life simpler (at least for regex) @terrorming , i think you can ignore those wp (that you\\'ve already finished).and continue on..(at least that\\'s what i saw in the 30 second roundup) i\\'m just redoing those for consistency (don\\'t like seeing lots of unfinished marks) but am not stressing over it  np @linusphan i understand that. angular (although, am still in process) was/is a light-bulb going off (or on)  @linusphan t h a n k you.... just kidding here\\'s brownie: thanks @linusphan  there are so many topics to get sidetracked... one thing that bugs me is the flashing this or that from the 90s hasn\\'t really gone away, it\\'s become more advanced (i.e., the potential gimmick value) i think let is more restrictive to current scope i think there are live non-profit projects that you\\'re required to accomplish/contribute. imo it\\'s reasonable to apply, but probably unreasonable in terms of expectations, if you don\\'t have projects/experience (in any context not just fcc) to show potential employer/client. can\\'t hurt to try.... was commenting more in terms of a competitive market scenario (don\\'t have the answers, trying to figure it out myself as well) hello @frawzey   this (in addition to everything else) is a great resource for resources (need to catch up on my bookmarked stuff as well) that plugdj is weird there are these avatars jumping around (sorry, to break the server deployment thread) @matteverson , i think i\\'ll bookmark that thanks, thx,  @0x0936 , i may just leave this thing on because plug.dj avatars are like a trainwreck one of the nice things, is \\'pay for what you use\\'  (cloud stuff: rack etc.) so, can i make the avatar in plug.dj move around and stuff ? i was going to go more substantive (like the server thing), but...how do you \\'woot\\' a song? @matteverson , thank you, i think the issue is there\\'s a separate sign-up (or least appears to be) for plug.dj so, i can see the messages (but like swazey to goldberg) but you can\\'t see mine (bad reference (and probably spelling) to early 90s movie: \\'ghost\\') hey somebody stole a sample from depeche mode you can\\'t avoid functions in js (some say \\'everything is a function\\' or \\'everything is an object\\') - or functions in really any other language what i\\'m still trying to wrap my mind around is the clear (or lack of) separation between sub and function in js it seems to be combined in function (i.e., do stuff and, optionally return stuff) right sub = do stuff if i think back to ancient days of vb (that comes to mind) i actually want to learn perl not a glamorous lang  i see utility (locally on a linux box) for some languages, because you still have to do stuff on the backend, even if it\\'s not directly front-end (if that makes sense) server side scripting.... they\\'re usually \\'built\\' with linux i\\'m not a java person either... but what is interesting is sometimes a recruiter will give a blurb about experience,.... and knowledge of a high level language is a plus @gstayton , me too... i wish i kept a scrapbook (link long gone) of this recruiter\\'s experience requirement summary ...it went something like \\'you can do a lot with javascript, but....\\' then went on to sort of poo poo it @gstayton , so true... it\\'s the same folks that say \\'how many lines of code\\'? which i yell at screen \\'if it\\'s a few lines, that\\'s code\\' if it\\'s \\'5,000\\' that\\' s stupid i always burn the brownies easier to buy from bakery i have an excuse.... had an ah huh moment with angular yesterday @alnano you can open a javascript console in most browsers and run it yourself i like firefox\\'s webide (although i set my runtime to their mobile) chrome/chromium still is the fastest... so, it get some amount of preference @alnano , it should be three bars top right -> tools -> javascript console np i have to figure out current draw of usb vs in wall charger ... phone seems to take a lot longer to charge via usb @gstayton it\\'s probably the plug--to wall (usb into two prong) that acts as a capacitor  1.5a is a lot.... that powers much bigger devices than a phone.... i think that would fry it i\\'m trying to go from memory @simonja02 lol lol hey, is that archlinux logo? yeah should be blue but looks like it though or (gasp) adobe i would really dislike it if an electrician had to google stuff that would suck oh, yeah.... no, it will work... let me just check my email... (checks google for electrician stuff) maybe a schematic for a specific machine.... but core competencies for an electrician? (or neuro surgeon )  no way run @0x0936 taking the general idea to the logical extreme.... there\\'s a difference in having references vs. core competency.  (e.g., you know enough about (n) to be able to know where to look for info (y). --  the original statement (using an electrician as an example) was not really aimed at somebody using electronic means to say (pull a schematic, etc.) but drawing basic knowledge from google...(kind of tongue in cheek)  c would be interesting to learn... isn\\'t it more direct with memory etc.?  so, we should know nothing (as it will change)? i\\'m  going to use that i agree with that. the conversation was actually about electricity (i.e., usb vs. wall chargers) i think the issue with metaphor... is that it\\'s being extended to web-dev. i think i can actually compile c in linux (maybe without additional packages) i have an ancient c programming book, looks scary @0x0936 everybody uses google, not just web-devs and electricians.  it\\'s a tool not xanadu @camperbot , are you sentient yet?  it would be cool if you could actually control the plug.dj avatar hello @raghuchandrasekaran  @jedpimentel does the c book you have, have an ascii chart towards the back? blue background with a really bad 80s cartoon c on front? (or late 70s) i\\'ll have to look (different cover) -also, includes ansi c from a style standpoint i\\'d take out the double closing tags on front end developer... are google and facebook the only two entities doing frameworks? (angular, react, etc.) seems like a pretty limited universe @benmcmahon100  ember has a \\'fork us\\' link are they on github? i see questions, about what wp are people on etc.,  for me, i come across a topic (like angular)/lesson... and it may send me on a journey far from fcc for a time.  it\\'s subjective (depending on the organization) some might value mediocre university over other things (even though some things (e.g., fcc etc., are more practical and up to date). if they\\'re fast moving (dev, startups etc. they might \\'get it\\' over others) piece by piece you can code on the weekends too already very much about cli, but got an email from codecademy about (that) as well. good for ca (and people that could benefit from it) tried the gitter app on linux, didn\\'t see any advantages over the browser version... so, dropped it where can i actually view all of the fabulous brownie points i\\'ve received? (or streak, etc.) i\\'ve been cheated. (no brownie points showing) @raultsc  glad it\\'s not my motivator, just curious @abhisekp yep that\\'s wp + brownies (so, confusing) t h a n k s @abhisekp  (if anybody, you\\'ll get that joke) thanks @abhisekp ! re-doing the css (in new version) feels disjointed with angular lol is it unusual to prefer js over css? having (which you don\\'t really \\'have to\\') do those over is a bit of a pain codecademy\\'s js lessons are a bit incoherent at times (however) do while loop seems problematic in un-compiled code you can also, do other exercises in tandem with fcc....  @benmcmahon100 , at least in the exercises... do while has other application when iterating over things with more stuff (i.e., yep, not just a guarantee of loop once) like checking against the values of an array (i think would be the closest i can get in this context) not arguing for do while loop... lol looks like it\\'s good for both jquery and basic js (have to read up on it) i should call it by its current script standard i think (it) wouldn\\'t take too kindly being called \\'basic javascript\\' off topic, but i used to use inkscape strictly for svg, but am finding it more and more as a complete authoring solution for offline docs. it rocks  so, is this something i will run into? (doing codeschool and other) -i.e., angular it\\'s one of the sections that still has \\'classic\\' video walk-through... but directs you to codeschool. is there an error that one will encounter coming back to fcc? hi @remainrelaxed  it would be a better challenge starting from zero knowledge i\\'m going to guess that the end challenge(s) actually have a godzilla sized cat with lasers coming out of its eyes  (just extrapolating from the beginning lessons with cat photos + progression lol) you know what, that could be a project @benmcmahon100 yeah. lol there was this 3d modeling software for linux (well, not specifically for)  i didn\\'t even attempt at really learning it.... is there a web equivalent? (canvas etc...) wow the red car is impressive thanks @benmcmahon100 i might actually check that out hey wait a minute your browser doesn\\'t support webgl (linux box ) maybe the font (in codepen) has to do with lato (and no fallback?) unrelated, i find that i have to (>40% of the time)) click run 1-3 times for things to kick in (fun modal and all) 3rd time might be paste related (i refuse to hand type a class reference over and over) it looked like it was running automatically (listener on key press or paste event) before in the earlier iteration( but post beta) is that the ominous dollar sign and dollar sign enclosed thing? i like the run button (even if i have to click more than once) makes interaction less shaky agreed (also, can see the progress (back end code to front end experience happening pretty quickly)  the loop is also, funny (because it never ends) lol maybe automatically comment the example code on save (of course folks would not be happy un-commenting code) that\\'s great (had no idea about the series ) maybe port related (but do you really want to host your projects on a local server (because that\\'s what your machine will become (if intended ignore comment)  btw hello @thehalibut and @davidnata83  yes, but you\\'re also a fish so that cancels out newb\\'ness i\\'m a newb (at least to front-end stuff) as well there are proprietary keys?  were they invented by m$? just kidding is there some sort of licensing (read volume use) associated with api key. like say, i have a site that gets a lot of traffic, etc.  how are the fees (generally) structured? @jbmartinez thanks... (this is interesting, i never considered) does one usually have a choice between open source and \\'keyed\\'? yeah, i wasn\\'t going to harp on dream weaver... but i did think it lol ok, so it sounds like (not that i\\'m at this point) one can do rack, aws, etc.. but then there are also, api costs to consider as well (production environment) for demo projects (associated with learning) is heroku viable option? can you throw assets  on heroku as well?  @jbmartinez , @benmcmahon100 , yeah... i think i saw the integration with ruby (and everything else )etc., when looking at heroku  a couple of weeks ago. (thanks, thx, than you -- brownie points) camperbot\\'s cutoff could use some work.  scenario: someone says \\'hello\\' someone responds \\'hello\\' first person says \\'t h a n k s\\' (for saying hello). 20mins later second person helps first person an \\'t h a n k s\\' is canceled. brownie points that is when one gets to the non-profit level, what\\'s the working scenario (i\\'m sure it differs by org). is it like a project group? is there a designated project maintainer that reviews stuff, etc.? @benmcmahon100 , i\\'m far from this (at the front-end level)... just wondering....  so there\\'s a project scope for non-profit and (i imagine) expectations for \\'deliverables\\' from the group? yeah, scope is important for sure one of the codepen examples got me wondering about arrays vs. collections i get, the key paradigm (accessing by etc.) mdn states there\\'s some uses memory wise, etc...  where would it make sense to use collection over array? (or, are they really the same thing?)  is it me or did animated gifs make some sort of comeback (i know they really never left)? i go through the exercises and it often sends (not directly) me to other sources to learn more...i want to understand the concepts, not just \\'power through\\' challenges.  probably an estimated century before completion. lol @benmcmahon100 , @michael-krebs , that\\'s funny (i.e., code contributors) yeah, if i hang on the streak thing... it doesn\\'t, always, reflect knowledge... weird dichotomy  am learning a whole c**p load though, (but still a front-end newb) relatively quickly @benmcmahon100 thanks for that (hoping to complete both codeschool and codecademy (yeah, that codecademy) angular courses awsome @prykor   is it me, or is there some stuff (e.g., code not carrying over, and references in, instructions to items not displayed) missing in jquery wp(s)? @arielleslie there is a \\'ghost in the machine\\'. i, literally, switched back to wp after comment ...and \\'stuff\\' was there.  that might be it (it was a mouse event that caused appearance /reappearance ) \\'mouse event\\' so 90s i should say \\'click event\\' that is interesting, (haven\\'t gotten to this yet) the function looks like it\\'s taking 3 arguments (not the combined single newarray) @kdbiddle yep. just thinking through example... what got me thinking (out loud sorry) is there are more arguments supplied than defined. @polsvoice , yeah have seen it but in other contexts that would error-out @polsvoice, i\\'m thinking in a non-js structure, i guess. if you declare a function in some languages (i\\'m going from memory) and you try to pass more arguments than declared... it will crash  @matteverson , @benmcmahon100 thanks... i\\'m still trying to wrap my mind around js\\' sort of \\'it\\'s all good dude\\' approach to stuff.   yeah, i had to quantify it in a catchphrase so i could keep my sanity lol that example doesn\\'t have any markup to render anything go for the formatting thing above (much, much easier) but you\\'re already way ahead @sherbethoover , you\\'ve got codepen already it\\'s like a code sandwich the backticks are the bread. you paste code between nice np , actually telling you about ctrl + enter was probably more helpful  (so, 1/2 brownie point lol) could approach, you\\'re probably familiar with spss wouldn\\'t a more data-centric approach be more helpful (not a critique but if you\\'re doing a dual masters... you\\'ve gotta sleep at some point) first solutions always (well almost) are bad habits. they\\'re the first step.  as you go along, and look back at code you\\'ve done in the past... that\\'s when you say: \"that is/was totally stupid\" i solved this with what\\'s in description replacing (n); but, i think @jbmartinez  solution is closer to real use. (i.e., \\'well\\' was specified) jquery is a bit fussy about unexpected tokens--- (figuring out compound stuff is a pita) yes, but wrapped in the script section (the jquery wrapper part sometimes throws me) that\\'s ok though, after the borg assimilation... frameworks, cross-browser tinkering etc. will be a thing of the past lol that\\'s one of the early exercises... which one is it @mrzappy ? that\\'s funny, i was looking right at that (sx vs. xs) -- and in highlighted markup.. blind i can usually tell if somebody is a developer (or it related, etc) without even talking to them. how weird is that?  hmmm, it seems to transcend physical attributes (although your examples are a dead give away) @ashroulston  lol you know i was avoiding \\'aura\\', but i\\'m entirely confident that i\\'m not the only one  i\\'m going back and re-doing wp (post beta to production)... you don\\'t technically have to though @strider99 maybe you can submit a unicode request... (the people there: \"smile is not gentle enough\", \"smile is too strong\"... ) lol demand more gentle emotes!  @jbmartinez agreed you probably need to install build-essential etc. in addition to the other suggestions, you probably want check which version of ubuntu you\\'re using (kde is installed over it by package or by kubuntu) lsb_release -a, and check some of the ubuntu boards  http://ubuntuforums.org/ would probably be a good stop  you mentioned both kde and unity (unless you\\'re selecting your desktop environment at the login prompt, you\\'re probably not using both at the same time) i some how stumbled into a c and java programming room (where\\'s javascript?) lol they know that: it\\'s just meant to make people spin their brains lol @danieldrasdo ,  there were some early issues with logins, (old git, new git), i remember there being a prompt to manage logins before (i had to fix mine)  @dnorthrupva is making me afraid of the \\'tomato clock\\' zipline, is it that bad/challenging? @dnorthrupva i like that approach this zipline (mention of it) has made me tune into sites that use countdowns etc... (.parse comes up somewhat (though not in this zipline\\'s context) some studies suggest that forcing yourself to take a break, helps with productivity - i have to see how it goes welcome @renovick  carbonfirelly nope. has word boundary, i guess.  i\\'m forcing myself to take a break, yet despite the studies i don\\'t feel more productive sounds more rhetorical @smoothpine, pretty much no (as @0x0936 points out in terms of new language). why the month timeline to learn?  (i.e., you may be  setting unrealistic expectations, that could affect your learning flow) a lot of pages do \\'are you sure you want to leave this page?\\' drives me crazy @jbmartinez some, really do, yes know it\\'s a different topic but i think it\\'s onbeforeunload. i always concerned about the potential for other things going on while dialog displayed, but it seems (by stackoverflow) that browsers add their own messages (to offset custom text) to mitigate potential security issues. was yeah, am on angular as well  i go back and forth with codecademy (they suck, they don\\'t suck) they do, however, have a lot of material @davidamandoestrada , yeah.... codeschool seems to have a very polished delivery on their angular course vs. ca good for you (that\\'s great)  @jbmartinez in a weird way, ca\\'s angular is better than their basic js different folks probably put that course together (i.e., apple to apples comparison within codecademy) @awesomeaniruddh , yeah i noticed that as well javascript code in basic js wp... shows up in left section (i.e., the code itself shows up around the red x or green) @jbmartinez doesn\\'t really bother me (provides a lesson in itself) although, gotta say... in a client situation, if they say (in essence) \"that\\'s confusing\"... then one would need to redesign   haven\\'t tried gitter on mobile. how do you like it @georgiel ? (other than it not autocompleting) ok, maybe need to revert to the plain text days.  --georgiel, how\\'s the mobile version working out? cool. will have to give it a try will be hard to format code on mobile i guess (depending on device) you could also, do speech to text. maybe the lags will cancel each other out. (although text to speech doesn\\'t always work too well) you can trim the random regex search (for bonfire wiki?), don\\'t think it would go by frequency lol are a lot of folks on the palindromes bf?  (haven\\'t gotten to that yet) oh, ok. i never seen that used as a verb. (wasn\\'t clear on your question). thanks @trickytiger, i know how to call a wiki entry, just haven\\'t gotten to that bf and was wondering the difficulty level  no problem, good try though. so, being between angular-land and going back over and redoing some of the existing waypoints...a question popped up (in my mind): is jquery implicitly referenced in \\'doc ready\\' function? you can download the framework etc., -but didn\\'t see any examples of referencing it in declarations. recursion -- codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1 and ms (yes, it ms but...):\\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/wwbyhkx4(v=vs.94).aspx so, nobody wants to field the implicit jquery declaration question? ms does a lot of stuff wrong; however, they do some things very well (why a ms vm will always have to be handy) probably my phrasing let me put it another way: is jquery magically (implicitly) called in \\'docready\\' function (just using that as shorthand)?  this would be similar to, say, custom fonts... you have to first point to the source (and then do stuff).  @arielleslie yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m saying... but jquery (at least from what i\\'ve seen so far, has some sort of transparent calling layer different from an actual html link (similar to fonts, libraries etc.) i think i just do the jquery download, and mess with their examples semi-locally i\\'ll ok, it doesn\\'t appear to be implicitly called found this on w3 and (of course) jquery\\'s site.\\n```\\n<head>\\n<script src=\"jquery-1.11.3.min.js\"></script>\\n</head>\\n\\n//note: this is not related to waypoints (it\\'s done automatically for you)\\n```\\n @tuniar there are some \\'services\\' that wrap the whole \\'make a website\\' thing into a paid, well service. but, you don\\'t need that... if you\\'re talking about production: it\\'s -domain name, a place to host rack, aws, etc., talent (you), stuff (your development) goes on the hosting site.  (but if it\\'s for learning purposes, all the other suggestions are sound) @arielleslie, thank you for the (ajax) link. provided an indirect perspective (though you can call jquery source script directly). the \\'full stack\\' part of things got me thinking about still more questions lol hey, the brownie point got cancelled out. try again: thanks @arielleslie  finally, yeah... that\\'s my understanding as well i wonder if when camperbot is ordering a hamburger (insert vegan whatever vegan alternative), does it yell in large font its order i refuse to use commas today @michael-krebs  cr** you\\'re right @arielleslie  you too well, (can\\'t actually go through a sentence without comma usage lol) must go back to the angular slog. got a gitter question: is there any way to tell if fcc rooms are active? (there are a lot of rooms, but a lot, literally, have comments >72 hrs) as last comment had no idea there were \\'empathy brownie points\\' lol welcome @dev-ans  when the convo is this slow, it reminds me of the aliens murmuring communication in the movie: dark city still trying to wrap mind around js closures... they make sense in a non-compiled paradigm with an exclamation it generates a camperbot greeting what\\'s your career path? or (desired career path) logic, and databases make pretty design work @willmead  do you think css and html make amazon run? @willmead but it\\'s, also, true if you website looks cra*** nobody will ever get to the functionality lol your that\\'s the intended purpose (or thrust from the curriculum ) i don\\'t think big ideas are necessarily connected with coding doesn\\'t hurt, but they\\'re not the same thing or coming up with a product that nobody knew they needed of course go linux i\\'m not crazy about apple\\'s os being tied to hardware i have to use windows vm for a lot of things (still). but linux is primary  i think there is some sort of giant mech robot tournament between us and japan that\\'s an odd pairing guess i\\'m going to have to do primer on coffeescript to get the ecmascipt 6 syntax that would crash stuff i would guess (or hope) that since browser is run locally any memory functions (done by the call stack hacks) would be caught at os level (i.e.., crash it) what changed? (i.e., there was a need to limit, now there\\'s not?) monday holidays make for ambiguous workflow hi, @abramcalhoun ... doing the  exercises is a good start @abramcalhoun imho, laptop will save you much heartache  100k (even with attrition) could be a driver for more non-profits (who knows?) my guess would be it\\'s difficult to gauge by login/streak etc., (sometimes you\\'re actively learning but on other sites (follow-up/reinforcement of concepts etc.)... @ashroulston those stats are (likely) really easy to gauge (as well, as number of exercises, etc.,) but, i too, am curious about long term @ashroulston not too shabby you have to set a manual fallback (via two size classes)? i thought, bootstrap was supposed to \\'automagically\\' resize (i\\'m not a bootstrap guru) @jedpimentel nice. i can see the utility in that for sure (makes me wonder if you can pass current \\'bootstrapped\\' rendering locations to js) welcome @mlichtenstern  @chocobowings , codecademy (yes, it\\'s an option) has an angular course too yeah, codeschool\\'s video/course delivery is very good @chocobowings , the funny thing (at least for me) is codecademy\\'s basic js course is so bad, that it almost soured any other of their courses (but yes, went back to ca as well) is/was @oopa  if you\\'re talking about gitter , i believe it\\'s in \\'appstores\\' for mobile, there are also, desktop clients for linux windows, etc. the fcc exercises,  (i believe) are generically web based (don\\'t know if there\\'s a mobile app) oh, you\\'re looking for something similar to fcc.  there are different categories (paid/free, etc.. ) etc., is that a suggestive \\'trick question\\'? (i.e.,  somebody should have such a blog?) include many cats in portfolio: nothing projects serious skills like cats. (yes, i\\'m joking lol) @ashroulston ,  it won\\'t work with dogs. only cats (they took over the internet long ago). @jbmartinez , oh no it\\'s actually...in fact, run by cats. so, the bonfire (s)... (and thanks, in advance camperbot) does \\'it\\' pass if the return value is valid (i.e., the route (your specific approach) can vary)? bonfire: thanks in advance @bk1995 , click within the black window (there\\'s more stuff below the typical line: you shouldn\\'t have to change code....) also, click the green run button twice  i have a vm that\\'s eligible for upgrade, however, i\\'m wondering if new windows is worth it my main os is linux @charis29 , it says they\\'re buying a whole lot of new volume licenses lol i\\'m not big on mandatory updates.  @benmcmahon100  btw, glad about the run button being fixed (quick bug turnaround) frankencode? wait a second here.... the green code buttons show the evaluation criteria for the bf, isn\\'t that in itself a clue? why not just setup a linux vm?  guess it\\'s a os preference thing. emulating linux seems more of a hassle than actually running things natively  lol opensuse isn\\'t a good distro for introduction (imho) go with something simpler like ubuntu @dannyfritz same here @lawlietblack if you install it (whatever distro, would recommend ubuntu though) in a vm the network connection is layered between your host machine and vm (it will present as a wired connection) so, in most cases you\\'re side stepping the nw card  true, you can bridge, etc...  dual-boot is better for performance, but if you don\\'t like the distro... then you have partition stuff that you\\'ll need to contend. (also, in that scenario... os is working directly with hardware, so you may have issues ) vms rule, (just be careful how much memory you allocate) @justaname94 , depends. if you\\'re running multiple vms (happens) then you have to factor what the host needs to operate comfortably. general rule (and some others may have better info) is to check the minimum requirements for your host (add a bit more) and the leftover for single/multiple vms  i like the \\'sandbox\\' element of vms as well i\\'d have to agree with @dannyfritz... ubuntu is well rounded (and easy).  one thing you have to watch for with some of the buntu derivatives is they sometimes don\\'t play nice with guest additions looks like a cairo dock if you wanted to retain the classic gnome look, you could install mate, and add a cairo dock (untested) over a vanilla ubuntu install, and it would work with guest additions without having to install headers etc. windows, actually, has been banished to its own vm... i still have to use it (yes, there are things that windows does well)... but i dislike it so @justaname94 awsome. glad it worked out. (i wanted to install bodhi (enlightenment) linux it sucked with guest additions @dannyfritz mostly database   than? mysql yes oracle? no hmmm, a lot of the sql examples seem pretty simplified. it helps to understand how relational dbs are structured etc. (which makes joins etc., easier to understand) - in the fcc course you\\'re actually doing mongodb which is not relational @dannyfritz , i do need to get with the mysql program as it\\'s the m in lamp (vendor syntax differences drives me nuts) @dannyfritz  those present interesting choices... looks like mariadb would be easier, but on the apache side that looks kind of interesting (if not painful) could it be that the image is nested in a column and row class? jquery, didn\\'t even look.... it\\'s late ha still slogging through angular angular (conceptually) is profound (still not there) so, here\\'s double brownie: thanks @lawlietblack  np... you\\'ll find that your windows os will be relegated to a vm eventually lol topic change: it seems, in some ways, that the coding (yes, by nature they converge)  aspect is easier than design.  @lawlietblack i don\\'t doubt it  make no mistake, if it\\'s (your project, site, app, etc.,) ugly nobody will ever get to the functiollity functionallity yes, but there\\'s not always equal strength in talent between the two pre made is a time saver... i kind of don\\'t like the generic look direction of various things design (not code structure) seems to take a lot of time for me (good ouput, yes subjective)  i agree on the balance thing for sure... you can take the reusable aspect of things and apply it to design (e.g., you don\\'t want to reinvent the wheel with some things when you\\'re pressed for time),  and maybe tweak things around the edges...  i\\'m glad text editors have the ability to collapse sections. all the css and jquery stuff can be hard on the eyes... reminds me of xml i just realized that it will be more than several hours before i can get a decent cup of coffee nooooooo that\\'s just wrong lol welcome @haribol007  @haribol007 , did you find having to say \\'h e l l o w o r l d\\'  kind of awkward? for cleaning tasks ? @happyconcepts  yes, it the first c program but still awkward when saying it in the real sense  vs. doing your first line of code awsome @psykobilliethekid  help coffeebot \\'you can do this\\' (without coffee) @yamaguchi59  are you saying \\'does it suck less during the day\\'? lol if you\\'re doing more advanced db work, backend language is not likely js java is more server side for database,  it\\'s not just mean stack with mongodb as you universe of choices...  i\\'d really like to learn python (or perl) but i feel like i\\'m spread a bit too thin still in angular land i can see how it rocks, just need to master it i can, also, see how kung fu rocks, but.... oh, camperbot... ever vigilante  with the (regex)  reminders  @mrzappy are you sure that\\'s all of the code? (don\\'t see a function declar) - the quotes, too (like mentioned) are problematic.  what wp is this? (looks similar to the old codecademy exercise) @jcadle we all feel stupid for a number of reasons.... you\\'re out of your comfort zone (that\\'s good) same here for me (and probably a lot of people) @mrzappy , i think there\\'s a bug in that codecademy excercise.  i passed that (what seems like eons ago, but not really) course and re-ran my code for that exercise and got the same error. maybe a cache issue? don\\'t know np ... i would eat coffee grinds at this moment. haven\\'t tried brackets but another user mentioned theseus js debugger...and must admit, it looks pretty cool  @abhisekp , is it worth it (i.e., is theseus nice in concept?)? i might check it (brackets) out... still love geany for its simplicity (and now sublime, sort of)  @jbmartinez , it\\'s really underated for some reason.... lol @abhisekp  yeah, geany is among default apps in smaller linux distros (doesn\\'t take a huge footprint and you can do builds etc) there was a spoof on kung fu movies (and the matrix effect) involving a kung fu cow  that\\'s funny.  missmannersbot i\\'d like to learn perl (don\\'t ask me why) i wonder if ruby would be a wide path around to get to some of the syntax elements if you have a deadline for (your) project, you should probably go with simple first @jbmartinez yep. for wrangling lots of files (text heavy manipulation) etc., perl seems to be a good fit (in addition to bash and various utilities)  @jbmartinez awk, sed... really handy... what do you find most annoying about perl? hi @markusm25  @jbmartinez , looking at a primer, (aside from the annoying \\'my\\' this and that) it sort of looks like js @clarkdh , access is not a good fit for a backend database (receiving traffic from web) so, a professor (heard on a ted talk) posits that \\'knowing anything\\' will soon be obsolete.  why am i doing these exercises again? lol yeah, i found the same paradox (questions) in this assertion you didn\\'t forget it @clarkdh ah, i see.... so it will be used as an export source (to something else) @clarkdh if i\\'m understanding correctly, you\\'ll need to transition to an enterprise level db at some point (if you\\'re talking dynamic access to the data (by said developers through apis etc.)) access is evil. fcc\\'s homegrown js wp(s) are better (in terms of annoyance factor) than (the old) codecademy exercises @jussjai, how are you liking the curriculum/exercises so far?   there\\'s a quick tutorial in git itself (top of page with the octopus/cat creature things at the top) should be a plus (+) sign at top right (and @dormouss makes a good point start with the wp first) of page wp = waypoints (there\\'s a map \\'button\\' in menu bar of fcc page) , see ya @dormouss  did you try accessing it with a new (assuming you\\'re using chrome) incognito tab/wind? lol, keep that excitement up @jussjai  @amanginc , yeah for complex stuff --it doesn\\'t hurt to copy your code into an editor (or run/fiddle in an editor or ide).. stuff can crash oh, that\\'s the problem: codecademy\\'s js tutorial is very confusing (poorly written (while other codecademy stuff isn\\'t bad) @wvmtnboy , yeah... i\\'m really tempted with python (and perl different route) but i think it would throw my focus off javascript (and the various frameworks) has grown into a serious language (not just for blinking cr** on pages like in the 1990s) although, there\\'s still a bunch of blinking cr** (it\\'s just way more complicated lol) welcome @peggywiltz  there should be a planet icon (to the right of search box), that takes you to the main list (although position can vary --) interesting (lua) don\\'t get the metatables thing metatables, mean something different to me, but i\\'m not grasping those in lua @catapixel , no.. but ask your question (am in angular land as well) are you pressing arrow down or arrow down (dedicated keys or shift on keypad)? @catapixel , i\\'m unclear on this as well (the video is a holdover from before)... it directs to codeschool, but i\\'m in codecademy angular as well. for me when i think i\\'ve grasped it, i\\'ll use the honor system, to mark as completed. (not much of an answer i know) @catapixel, i understand... i think (and i\\'ve probably said this before) that angular is profound...   the \\'modular\\' approach, sort of brings js into management concepts that i\\'m familiar did you get a water bottle? a sandwich is so much better than a stinken water bottle oh, that\\'s cool yeah, i was just going to say that got me thinking about rasberry hi @sbalcombe   @davidamandoestrada ,  that actually sounds fun.. on par with a star wars or star trek convention, but fun nonetheless  lol i don\\'t think they let you see \\'the real\\' google office. it\\'s probably some cardboard standup for tourists yeah, that needs a regex boundary it might match on: fishing troller (if you can\\'t spell trawler lol) when camperbot can self program, we\\'re all doomed @tyhandita yes i do, i believe camperbot left one of its arms back in time although, you know what...that just pointed up an inconsistency (well it\\'s a movie) if skynet was self-aware, why were the robots going back in time not?  i have neither. cra* all the hollywood stuff aside (or not), i was listening to some podcast with ai researchers. they\\'re not really trying to make things think like people (turing test) but better and different... lol, but wasn\\'t that sending a chip with your name to mars? (not actually, flying to mars... i think they would have an issue with all of the cheetos i\\'d have to bring along) well apple did its rollout recently, so semi-random  that\\'s how dynamic conversation works.... see? lol  (but, yes, apple\\'s pricing is like 90% profit) good for you (that\\'s great!) \\'tone\\' is sometimes hard to relate in text (but sometimes you have to use the dreaded exclamation) lol i have seen it overused in business communication throughout history xml hasn\\'t been completely vanquished (but i need to get with the json program) @progmacattack - so, you too have been \\'blessed\\' with a microsoft starting point (development wise)? (i.e., that timeframe) the date formatting thing is interesting, didn\\'t see any one-liners (or chaining).. most of what i saw was (web search) writing a function and grabbing different elements of date and combining) gmt, edt is for?  (i.e.,  why the workaround to produce desired format?) congrats @chocobowings ! @progmacattack ,  maybe the functions are acting more like classic procedures? (i.e., not returing a value) value room has strange convo-dropping-off timing: there\\'s like 50 million users, but goes silent - darn, @tommyizen just disproved the cost of living probably eats that up pretty quick though true, my guess is if you\\'re in house dev you may  or may not have the opportunity to be remote partially, yep. but the higher you go in salary (and you\\'re not a consultant), they\\'re going to want you closer to operation(s) location go linux @iheartkode, do you have to pay more for spikes in traffic, etc.?   looks pretty reasonable https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/ one is lucky if they\\'re maxing out their plan (and need to grow --ah, would be a good place to be)  i think the \\'.well\\' part is wrong @carl-parrish  if you apply the example (with particular (n)) in left pane, it should pass. (don\\'t know if it\\'s technically accurate in this case (n) = 2 what? the book recommendations are gone? i need to use scrapbook more often automatic suggestions/completion based on language all the api keys/pricing, at some point, google and yahoo added \\'software\\' to their lists of services. weird shift from the days of browser bundling lawsuits, etc.,  totally understand that. just say thanks thank you with @  in front of user name yes, @trickytiger this time. next time, you\\'ll type something quicker and beat me happens to me all the time people are lighting fast here bye but there are pauses (when people are not lightening fast) lol are you doing inline js? or with an external file are you talking about a fcc exercise (yes, 20 questions)? or trying from a page you built? ok, you may want to paste your code help formatting yeah, script goes above yeah, there\\'s no \\'doc ready\\' (also, doesn\\'t affect your exercise, but doc type/encoding goes at the top) @king0120  that looks good (although it snaps me back into the 1980s) it\\'s even faster than analog simon that kind of reminds me about css in general, i know the general \\'drag and drop\\' thing is eschewed, but when i\\'m trying to figure out positioning, it\\'s tempting (vs. code, run, check (repeat))   i\\'m running the same specs as @0x0936 ,  let me try too np, but when i select link directly it\\'s now timing out ok, now it\\'s running again (the background pic is loading). it seems on the successive same colors blips 1-4  like blue aren\\'t factored... i think (this is much faster than what i struggle to remember about simon game) not fairly, totally. welcome @larryya  oh, ok... i didn\\'t remember doing anything worthy of a brownie... lol i think there\\'s a free microwave at the end of the brownie-point path just joking then people will be saying: \"where\\'s my free microwave?\" lol @0x0936 , but it would be on the \\'weight watcher\\'s version of brownies which are tasty when you\\'re hungry. i\\'d take one now  something i didn\\'t know (and another user pointed out) is the gitter notification settings are -per room- (i.e., you have to be in that gitter room to change its settings: it\\'s not global) just in case anyone else\\'s email box gets loaded with automatic gitter cr**  that\\'s true. you (just) have to do it in each room\\'s (that you\\'ve accessed eg., youcandothis, etc.) settings\\n these card games... monochrome monitor? @drunkfurball, no i was joking (although you could make the font look like). these games\\' genesis was in mostly monochrome monitorville  @drunkfurball i knew that before you said it lol hi, @danger1300  i see the utility in the whole bootstrap grid thing, but was googling around for a way to visualize \\'the grid\\' (when editing) looks like people are applying some css/jquery tricks  if you\\'re in a *nix like environment you can also, run: locate seed.js  they\\'re doing inline css to make the lessons easier or internal styling to be more exact no pressure or anything lol how\\'s it going @iheartkode ? same here (though not rails) . taking break to reconnect with the nerd-collective lol are you doing an in-place upgrade? (noooo start fresh). oh, good... i was getting upgrade flashbacks  i\\'ve never had good luck with distro-upgrades (they take forever and (in my case) they\\'re always a little sketchy.). i just save home and start fresh... (but it too is a pita)   @ntpfun you\\'re not limited to fcc.... you can do different lessons, in tandem with all that is out there  yeah same here, five years of support (lts) is kind of my minimum. there are a lot of distros that have rolling releases @ntpfun , also, there\\'s lots of stuff beyond html(5), css  to get there (like js and the frameworks that go along in \\'the full stack\\'... more than enough to keep one busy) i tried mint too (not a bad distro), but ubuntu (with a kde) is the least \\'bs\\' distro out there imo (i.e., i can concentrate on stuff i need to do) i don\\'t know what i\\'d do without screen edges when i want \\'classic gnome\\' i tend to use mate @jkirch you had a bad interview experience? @jkirch that\\'s good (not the not getting part). if the post mortem is objective that\\'s helpful (sans beating yourself up over it)  now it\\'s \\'the language\\' yes the lol the is really dependent on context (of course i\\'m joking a bit)... if you\\'re doing front end stuff it\\'s safe to say that it\\'s a prerequisite  (i.e., js) i remember the flashing \\'this or that\\' in early webpages (as well as netscape). js has grown for sure.  @jurgenzz how was you angular experience? hey, @graysonhary  welcome @jurgenzz , angular is one of the things i\\'m learning (more in depth codeschool + codecademy), general thoughts on your experience learning it nice i\\'ve seen \\'no egg\\' / sugarless cakes in work settings i loved the modem that mathew broderick used (almost as good as the brick cell phones a little later in time lol) @michael-krebs , who needs instant info? with classic tech it only takes two weeks to download an   email lol forget star wars, if somebody told me that i\\'d have a device with no moving parts that could hold an entire music library, make calls, and search (the yet implemented internet) i would say: \\'uh, huh.. well, i need to change the batteries in walkman\\' hey @jbmartinez  oh, yeah, i forgot must master angular... i knew there was something it\\'s the modular part that attracts me to angular, are there other approaches (i.e., i think my brain is trying to square other language paradigms with js) google doesn\\'t seem to ask on a mobile device @jbmartinez  that\\'s the good part! (lol) i think it\\'s trying to put js into a modular paradigm (or bad depending on perspective) @jbmartinez hmmm, that does sound better (i.e., retaining more js type stuff pared with modeler approach ) what alternatives to you like?  were these rotten waffles? @jbmartinez i was going to go in sequence: angular, react .... now i\\'m curious about react (see how non-linear my learning is! lol) true yeah, it\\'s the space but i\\'m pretty late on the answer but bash loves spaces. (in fact, if you don\\'t place those correctly it will make big stink) and a powerful ally it is (refresh) wow, we were this close to having \\'refresh\\' being known as \\'random-dog-jumping\\' (the whole bug thing comes from actual bugs found in circuit boards) lol why is that a bad thing? (it\\'s not an error per se) fallback on ip maybe? here\\'s what i don\\'t get (i\\'m not on the weather exercise yet)... if user declines geo, why can\\'t the same approach used in js (with a lot of pages) be applied (i.e.,  random site works best with javascript enabled)? don\\'t know if the link given was the same as http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp this one is neat too https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/css/css_colors/color_picker_tool @mvr1976  i think the next thing is purchase of amway products but i\\'m not certain don\\'t quote me nice, you\\'ve got the planet down... it\\'s just a matter of working backwards at this point lol @mvr1976  just kidding. all you need to do is just start the lessons (if you get stuck, there are lots of folks to offer assistance here) (i.e., if your research on solving your problem doesn\\'t work out,  ask!) who needs city specific weather? i like entire planet weather better don\\'t change it weather really dominates this room (yes, it\\'s the weather app exercise generating...but, what\\'s up with that? lol) i feel i should be standing in front of a green backdrop pointing to patterns welcome @jenad1kr  good for her lol it is but it\\'s not limited to weather drivers\\' \\'visibility\\' is already bad. if you\\'re talking about motorcycle(s).... rain, just adds more to equation  @vinay1095 i think you can paste the codepen i would say work your way to node.js with the other exercises there\\'s a course map at the top of page (if you have fcc tab or another window open) @vinay1095 you may want to put the codepen link so users can evaluate (issue) the project output  omg ok, this is a scenario where invoking collapse is totally appropriate the coding part, (switching out colors on so many tiles) is cool. but, i\\'d have to say that the end result could be stroke inducing for some users. lol\\n @vinay1095 , great now that codepen is there... others can comment....  i\\'m not on this exercise, but the js (don\\'t know if codepen automatically references) isn\\'t referenced in html (script) portion... (there\\'s weather whatever but not the js you have) don\\'t know if that helps yes, we just didn\\'t know that arnold would reprise his role as an aarp member (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that, but hard to buy the \\'aged cyborg\\' thing) @cowfu true, but i think they are going to make him an actual t1 folks don\\'t generally tend to use celsius in nc  @thepeted , the get location from ip part is good pretty neat overall np @thepeted  i think that\\'s a great approach... you see a lot of questions (in fact, in the last hour or so) people getting stuck on user declining geo location @thepeted  was looking at telize (trying to work out their examples in my head) i heard that as well, not cool maybe the site isn\\'t mobile responsive wow, everyone gets a trophy (or in this case brownie points). ty @shifthawke  i\\'m sure camperbot says at the end of the day \"all of these regex firing tasks, and bonfire this, and bonfire that, and wikis-- there\\'s got to be something more\" lol i think the emperorbot (from return of the jedi) would be cool. sith lighting whenever a bonfire is referenced  so, there\\'s a bot hierarchy? and all the bots have the \\'hate on\\' for siri.  if that\\'s ingrained into ai were all screwed  we\\'re lol the \\'internet of things\\' (translated, the conduit for p*** off ai bots) lol yeah, i was thinking the same thing... pause, pause, and then another question = run you\\'ve got the marketing aspect down... one letter (or symbol like prince) simplicity is (actually) a great thing in design you could reverse engineer the fcc exercises, (i.e., the panels sections) are you talking about placing things into sections? (i too find scrolling forever kind of a pita) not cats again when cats and bots get together, then suspense ... ok, i got nothing no, not cats vs. bots cats and bots together,  like a really bad takeoff on the avengers thanks, camperbot. i didn\\'t want to read a full length article.  sounds like a potato-chip (albeit corn/cheese based) bot  actually, the \\'complaints\\' about camperbot are golden. it\\'s unedited feedback for those that do the programming on it.  which part? <checks connection speed oh, ok. i thought you were employing some sort of rhetorical suspense technique <checks that there is actually a connection hi, @gilbertcreations  verb lol on the fly \\'verb-a-nizing\\' is the best (especially when you\\'re in an work-audience situation) are you using firefox? (i.e., @genesisjoec ,  there are a lot of hits ranked in firefox order for recursion errors) dunno try it in chrome and see what happens @genesisjoec  just \\'think through\\' the examples that you find. i think you have to ask camperbot i\\'m super dumb and have no sense of humor  lol no, no... it\\'s true remember ruprecht from dirty rotten scoundrels? only thing missing is the eye patch  and triton   sadly no. you\\'re expected to retain all info in the first try. no practice lol of course (practice, practice, and practice some more) i\\'ve had to redo wp because i signed up right on the cusp of fcc moving to an updated curriculum. so, sort of not-really-mandatory-mandatory practice  do they still make tang (the \\'orange-ish\\' flavored drink)? you haven\\'t seen milk?\\n oh, i forgot @jbmartinez   well i still love tang (the drink) it\\'s good too.  cheap it\\'s choco flavored water made to look like milk and there are certain political aspects to some south american countries that makes familiarity with easily accessed milk and (things like yohoo) kind of problematic omg tang does still exist yes, i had to google it seems they have changed the packaging  i wonder if they changed the glorious 95% sugar crystals to 5% unidentified orange crystals recipe? oh, no... camperbot was invoked thanks (invoke again) @shifthawke  camperbot doesn\\'t like low-profile hats i remember those (hats) from the early 80s now they\\'re cool lesigh les sigh? yeah, yeah.... but to get that french sounding part i think you have to use les are you iterating over two arrays or trying to iterate over contents of 1st array? raises an interesting question (sorry for the side analysis) wouldn\\'t it be more efficient /explicit to do somearray.foreach   huh what kind of interview was this? lol also, it\\'s semi-transparent depending on text scrolling by for some sizes, it\\'s solid... for others it\\'s not... (clues?) @m6cheung , i think the interviewer is trying to gauge you\\'re ability to deal with ambiguity  was one thing about linux distros: hibernate is sometimes taken as shutdown completely (i don\\'t think i chose, \\'what to do when lid is shut?\\' well, of course shutdown!   what\\'s the list of errors? typos are so unforgiving thank the person with @ in front of name like this: thanks @jbmartinez  ok, what\\'s the question? also, terminal output is gold  the class convention is correct, but are there even any <i> tags in that wp? it\\'s the \\'all\\' of our buttons wp that has <i> tag, i was going by the title given...  lol yeah, i know @jbmartinez ,  the first execercise doesn\\'t have that element, (i was going by what was given)  common it trap lol grids yeah, val has no value is argarr undefined? no, i mean the index of .... , if you put a console.log statement in that loop it returns undefined maybe it\\'s late and i\\'ve had too many sardines i think their potential for bloating is some sort of karma wait, that empty val is called twice in that function i should have opted for tuna over a can (tin) of sardines implicit arg (val) being returned in the loop tuna and coffee (not in the same cup) hi, @amragaey  what\\'s the issue? (somebody will help for sure) or marginally sure careful with eval not knowing these concepts, i think argues against that kind of project at least in short term (not impossible, \\'when\\' is as good a question as \\'how\\') or not, code away with reckless abandon lol why? what\\'s the purpose of project? (i.e., sort of not defined = random takes on possible answers) oh, ok... i thought there may be a reason for vagueness  you know..  there are already online interpreters (haven\\'t really looked at those: i would just run locally ) ? why is there a hint call if it just redirects you somewhere else? \\nsheesh\\n @jbmartinez ,  oh, there\\'s no room specific context.... (no, excuse for not knowing... it\\'s all on git right? lol)  \\'fork it\\' don\\'t \\'wonder it\\' i guess lol same here (except for a passing lesson on that repo) @jbmartinez  i need to finish map as well first be humble, and be a new programmer badass comes later you\\'re already on your way @amragaey you ask questions what? being rolled for your dinner by your own dogs is pretty sad lol i remember the chijacks reference (because i was like what\\'s a chijack?) now i have knowledge that neither man nor machine can take chijack wow, i just caught an error noooooo do not invoke \\'it\\' (aka camperbot) you did @jbmartinez i think you understand lua\\'s history (not same country) better than a lot of folks  cats decide if they like you yes, dogs (potentially) will bite you if they don\\'t like you... with cats, it\\'s a little more subtle  yeah \\'bling\\' sounds like code wanting to be hip balancing media with media loop kind of like after eating chocolate, then eating some really salty chips (<--endorses healthy eating choices just in case non-profits are monitoring) i meant to say kind of like eating some apples and then some healthy tree nuts hmm ah, life without camperbot... scary thanks (free brownie points) @dting  oh, total cheap play for brownie points noooo i hate empty brownies .... it totally takes away from their intended purpose: helping argh yes, yes you are totally lol the conversation flow is dynamic... a technical question will come up, and the \\'flow\\' goes towards that yeah, you could have this (\\'flow\\') or 20 minutes of zero posts @mgm0136  avoid codecademy\\'s basic js course @mgm0136 , have you gone through all of the fcc waypoints in basic js? there are different learning styles... i think if one is too stilted; it may discourage new learners from asking a question.  if you grew up in the 80s or early 90s, you couldn\\'t avoid stephen king movies or hairspray there\\'s a jimmy falon skit i like the structure, but there are areas that could use improvement... (that\\'s true of anything, not to get all kaizen) he does that (or did that before gitting hit by a van) i think he was really seriously  injured in that accident @shifthawke stephen king was hit by a van (i think) sometime back i thought it was a vw van lol @djrunas , that is the question. i wonder, on average, how employers will value (i.e., as a process) the fcc cert (doesn\\'t bother me either way, learning a lot ....) there\\'s a modern take on that theme called \\'drag me to hell\\' (movie) sucked \\'drag me away from this stupid movie\\' is what i mistitled it  it\\'s like how do you forget the cursed button that the gypsy gave you  oh, yeah it was the bf in the movie who gave her the jacket hey, nice jacket doh! it\\'s ah, ah  \"what?\" a cursed button....that the gypsy oh, nevermind there was this stapler, ruler... and then... (it was a really bad movie) oh, that was bad both: rosemary\\'s baby and blair witch (overused consumer camera approach) that cinematography effect was adopted into a lot of other stuff (kind of like the matrix effect) yeah @jbmartinez  (i was like huh?) lol @jbmartinez  the effect of filming such that it simulates some person running around with a video camera. i.e., first person documentary effect there\\'s probably some word for it here it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shaky_camera the only movie that actually scared me (ok two) was exorcist and hell raiser wait i missed one; the orignal poltergeist original sort of implausible though: \"hey, honey look at this chair moving by itself\" response: \"oh, that\\'s weird\"... @julianaramburu they remade it? that\\'s true... it\\'s so annoying @julianaramburu will avoid it i hope not, then apple will get the idea to make the istomachpad (hey, they already did it with a watch) yeah, no idea i think that\\'s bad design (scroll forever,)  i like sectioned layouts or better yet, dynamic layouts!  (why i\\'m loving learning this stuff) that\\'s ok, mobiles will be laptop sized soon.  honestly, i\\'m all for nerdness but having a fricken tablet (aka what\\'s supposed to be a phone) in a holster , on your belt... makes you look...  it\\'s so within the realm of possibilty did they swap out obi wan? it was originally (in the prequels) the guy from train spotting wasn\\'t it elipses? there was a time when i could spell me too, the basic commands were at the bottom of the screen in these weird blocks when ibm wasn\\'t just for mainframe and they partnered up with this life sucking software company so, potential candidate... can you explain why you referred to us as a \\'life sucking software company?\\' what\\'s that @hugoender  that\\'s like applied (insert topic here). it\\'s hard to do theory you have a need (project) then the answer will come.  (at least for me) noooo @hugoender  two things would be working against you: 1. you\\'d be a new programmer and 2. you\\'d be desperate (stay employed while learning)  yep ok, not following the mouse like creature that attacks people have you tried dollar store? how do you know it\\'s a demonic mouse (as opposed to garden variety critters)? you should reason with it not as much no @smrum ,  although, you do get an external reference to codeschool for angular i can\\'t tell if somebody is grilling or my laptop is frying smells like classic bbq charcoal  or my laptop is about to go south try removing 4th ( @shifthawke what wp is this? https://github.com/rafase282/my-freecodecamp-code/wiki/jquery ```\\n// i don\\'t take credit: link is above\\n<script>\\n  $(document).ready(function() {\\n    $(\"button\").addclass(\"animated bounce\");\\n  });\\n</script>\\n\\n``` it\\'s like the outermost (although, some would disagree with my characterization of jquery) \\nfunction) see ya @jbmartinez  right next to the demon mouse lol nc has some serious wildlife possums are really not among nature\\'s most clever of creatures i saw something known as a humming bird moth (looked like a fricken flying lobster though) is there some reference i\\'m not catching (i.e., bob) i usually take it to mean \\'the bobs\\' in office space that\\'s so wrong and... there\\'s a possum named bob, so that makes it even more wrong lol who needs finite control over a silly thing like a cursor? lol\\n you\\'re too demanding oh, that sucks even more it\\'s useful for coupons....  you\\'ve just saved 30 cents! (shaking buttons) tell em what they\\'ve won bob that\\'s what i\\'d use it for (too good to waste on validation) oh, no @dcsan has taken manual control of camperbot lol that\\'s because he\\'s camperbot at the moment he\\'s the dev (yes, i\\'ve been pretty much dissing camperbot   all day) lol don\\'t know, but if you watch the monthly videos they usually have some of what (i imagine) the cor folks core they do the videos were on twitch i\\'ll be glad when flash is gone.  even with html5 you\\'re still dealing with containers/codecs (from what i read, it\\'s not as simple as bingo: now it\\'s html5) howdy @rasheinstein  like a car that requires lead gas but no longer is produced. how about you? i ate these sardines, (like many hours ago)  it renders differently. how\\'d you do that? (i.e., avatar #1 and avatar #2 magnified)  yeah, but i\\'m having a side convo seamless transitions are for polished fare... good ole hard break in topic is so much more efficient ugh, now me talk about this... (see how effective that is ?) lol you have to learn how to deal with (less than seamless) topic breaks... clients want what they want on their own terms (fast shifts for people with not a lot of time in the business world)  i made myself not do anything productive today (had to) so, i was on the fence... should i be a front-end dev or a hand model  ? you can\\'t do both no they\\'re hideous but, i can try you\\'ve crushed my dream of being a hand model lol that\\'s the spirit battery memory at near 0 capacity  there\\'s the bbq smell again, where is this coming from? who\\'s grilling at 12:00 am ? seriously, i\\'m checking to see if my laptop is frying something (sure smells good)  marinate some chicken throw your laptop over and voila! i\\'m pretty sure there\\'s no valkyrie\\'s ride playing in the background  well, hmmm... probably not the score to go along with my laptop frying some food (although, for the life of me i can\\'t find it...) somebody is grilling, but the smell comes and goes totally stumped wind is at a constant speed/direction that\\'s the problem: it smells great i think that was the first (proposed) star wars\\' prequel \\'phantom griller\\' didn\\'t get a lot of positive feedback i don\\'t know how these movie title formulas work, but using the force to grill a steak... seemed like a winner to me i think there\\'s a breakfast burrito now i like the simple sidebar template thing (reminds me of deprecated frames) it even has a toggle (side bar goes away)... simple but kind of neat  like if you have a whole bunch of content to manage global model is the enterprise at a whole what kind of entities are you trying to abstract into an er model?   @ironedr  this is something i once asked as well .. although there are relationships between different entities... there\\'s no logical universal relationship (i.e., the indirect tie-in)  to tie everything at the global level (i.e., yes things can be related because the designer wishes it so by saying \\'this is all at the global level)... i think what you may be getting at is this:  https://books.google.com/books?id=p8ldlywio9qc&pg=pa65&lpg=pa65&dq=what%27s+a+global+er+model&source=bl&ots=mxnh0gnqv9&sig=fsjpmubwct3avrtlc3cvxm2ph98&hl=en&sa=x&ved=0cfmq6aewcwovchmiplzxoy-gyaivxzeach0iga1j#v=onepage&q=what\\'s%20a%20global%20er%20model&f=false i see things as separate er-models, but can be grouped into an \\'enterprise model\\'. but there\\'s no logical join at least to me... oh, no not camperbot cr** the book might have just sucked in english as well can you really update a wiki (not can but should)? but, how does that work? (like consistency in content etc., ) what if drivers\\' manuals used the wiki approach this techo reference... (sorry a bit late) it reminds of (another) canadian \\'band\\' in the late 90s thanks @joepurdy  (that comment is golden and so true) free brownies for you (i\\'d give you more if i could) see ya @joepurdy  i have to laugh at the presumption that nc = whisky swilling folk question: how are the bonfires/ziplines evaluated? is it subjective? or is there some sort of benchmark hello @rayb0rn . code long and prosper don\\'t know why spock came to mind i was thinking about  a question that somebody asked about a js interview, and then spock popped in nope, just random star trek  see ya  don\\'t do that lol cause/effect @alan1001110 there are a lot of dev tools to deal with debugging js (beyond js console) help formatting unicorn rainbow? @kp950  paste between the backticks (they\\'re at top and bottom) i\\'m sorry @kp950 , i got sidetracked with unicorn rainbow.... (i\\'m still like: \"huh?\") you would overwrite your value in a loop @kp950 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/return the gyro effect (haven\\'t seen it in person) is the potential worst.... (one wheel off ground spinning at a different rate of speed, when it reconnects with the ground, flips bike) not the sandwich although tasty used to, yes  sportbike(s) and \\'standard\\' all in hondaville you\\'re very lucky did you hurl later ? what kind of old honda? mid 1980s? my motorcycle days (although i\\'d say you\\'re one for adventure if you\\'re riding anywhere close to dc metro) are behind me i had to (at one time) drive a non-two wheeled vehicle in that area most of the time at a standstill... but not the best drivers in the world lol lol i totally forgot, @rbunz08 the page looks nice (i didn\\'t test the functionality though) when you\\'re riding, you become very attuned to what\\'s going on in the driver\\'s (car) mirror (you can almost just tell when somebody is going to swap lanes without signaling )  and never sit in the middle of the lane at a stop. always on the edge left or right, so you can throttle  out when some a **** is looking down at their phone bye @kp950  hmmm @tzahile aside from fcc,,  you may want to consider copyright  issues i\\'m going to give you answer (without even looking so, it could be wrong) - there was a portfolio example with image that scrolled by a min ago wait, you\\'ve totally changed your username lol lol @tzahile ,  ok... what\\'s the issue again? (i see all the individual images (as well as the background) rendering in the codepen @tzahile a couple of things: 1. if you\\'re saving a file locally (and referencing it locally in the tag that could be problematic) 2. when you say \\'thumbnail\\' are you talking about facebook type of stuff (when sharing a link for example)? anybody ever used a coffee warmer? (you know the cheap disc with a pad thing you usually see around the holidays) coffee = coding fuel pros? cons? i suppose you could put whole beans (into said spirit) for something exotic what reference did you use to get to the site? ok nvm.... that is the site.... looks great didn\\'t test it (not (potentially) bricking my phone) lol yeah, i\\'m looking at the page source now i went to the link www.materializecss.com, i\\'m liking this simple stuff like putting <li> stuff</li> into a button neat ideas thanks @kinginthenorth i\\'m bookmarking this nice the other background was better i think i remember this from a day or two ago there weren\\'t penguins? are you sure? lol seriously, i do remember this layout.... the first was better imo do those cancel each other out?\\n that\\'s true too, localhost... but, what  i\\'m wondering can you have more than one reference (i.e., multiple versions) very nice... i like the easy access layout of the projects (and the post demo \\'let\\'s work together\\') and that animation is pretty cool how come 60fps (video runs between 29.9 and 30) ? (depending on quality.. i remember some formula for human perception of motion (i.e., animation) i forgot what it was but  was well below even video i remember macromedia sad lol so, i\\'m looking at the comparison (30fps vs 60fps) the 60 frame looks sharper, but i\\'m not sold on whether that has to do with frame rate. the \\'motion\\' looks the same make sure they\\'re thoughtful questions keep it short main points, don\\'t (for pete\\'s sake) read the questions or tell them how you\\'re going to make their products less sucky no, @buzzlightyear90  know the questions....  if you familiarize yourself with something, you\\'re not memorizing it (per se) you know it.  and that shows (vs. reading off questions which, personally, i wouldn\\'t be as impressed with) @buzzlightyear90 don\\'t spend too much time on that part, (yes, yes, they want to know if you\\'ve done your research) but -- they want to know if you\\'re competent and would be a good team fit here\\'s a simple question to ask: \"what is the most immediate problem that needs to be fixed/improved\" -in x team, x product, x process etc. ,  most of this stuff (animations and the like) is \\'use with care\\' imo... i personally, dislike sites that employ a lot of media, (and its effect on whatever hardware) not saying i\\'m immune to it (\\'hey, that\\'s cool, gotta use that), but if it pi*** off user (or detracts from the service/goal) then .... same here, how\\'s the rent in new guinea? got google translate (what possibly could go wrong?) lol why sinatra? do you know thai? yes... sounds like a bad plan ok, this is good.  what if you lose your laptop (or other device) and don\\'t know how to speak thai (or the front code that you\\'re learning)? back end dev (or administration) is good stuff @thec0mposer , to some extent that\\'s true; (not necessarily day to day).  i don\\'t apply a bohemian ranking to technologies though lol @shifthawke why sour? hi avengerabinash grr @avengerabinash  it is monday that\\'s a reasonable amount of \\'suckyness\\' on any day  there are a bunch of simon game sounds (out there) you could sample a clip with audacity (or equiv editor for os) @dealpete , that\\'s an interesting question, (i\\'d like to add audio too) if you look at the other pens, some folks put an external link (which is what you\\'re asking, how/where to host) to file. maybe there\\'s a \\'ready to go\\' clip you could link (to)?  (i\\'ve also, seen, that you can try to get/put resources in  git but haven\\'t done it) some for sounds (i just did a search) http://codepen.io/tag/sound/ i don\\'t think dropbox would be good for that (anything resembling hosting of resources), you\\'d have to share folder, no? was thinking the same (one shouldn\\'t have to go all over h*l* and back) just to link to a sound file weird markup: ok gitter... hell and back but h + forward slash works too *don\\'t think it\\'s the italics* lol aws is utilized a lot with a lot of serious production stuff  i\\'m thinking about aws,  i think @dealpete \\'s dilemma (what to do when you need your own hosted resource) is instructive if you span it out a bit to other things that sucks, that would have been perfect (which is why it must be deprecated (no revenue))  no kidding lol...  aws, is looking better and better: (in low tier) it\\'s an infinitely better investment than running a local server (forget that)  @arielleslie (i think i\\'m imprinting subjective stuff to the joke, which makes it more humorous)    i remember (kind of tangential, yes) you mentioning cloud9, looks like they work/partner with heroku (wonder if that would be an option) there\\'s some good \\'ubuntu-ness\\' there (totally sidetracked now) yesterday it was materializecss now cloud9... there are so many good examples/suggestions here... am totally all over the place! lol looks good @levyian , but it won\\' let me switch to celsius (not that i\\'m a big fan of celsius)  hmmm well, it was a \\'draggable\\' control... so, drag? this feature (calling bf details from camperbot) is like reading a phone book (at one point in humane experience we had these big paper things with phone numbers) out loud i\\'m not in italy.... but yes, it\\'s working (the control is clickable but looks like slider) not being picky (it looks good) there was an example of a fallback to ip location that i saw for this weather app. very clever. . i think the permissions that different services request (geo, blah, blah) are magic twinkies (i.e., dialogs with messages to give you the illusion of choice)   lol no, but actual twinkies would be great  looks like a string the mist was good mdn (i know there\\'s a lot of \\'round the way to get there\\') has it as new boolean(false); is it a matter of preference? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/boolean are you talking about alkaline levels? lol (sorry, never saw camel case applied to php) disquiet reminds me of movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/ dark city (actor rufus something, something) it is bad *** .  great movie @mrhormonas , what was the question? (i think i missed it, maybe can\\'t answer it, but don\\'t remember it) it\\'s a great movie i was trying to say that it was bad a^^ here are some brownies (they have no value in bangkok): thanks, @thec0mposer   what\\'s weird (though not helpful) @mrhormonas you have more rows (yes they\\'re undefined) appended than what\\'s in your user array @jerometorno i\\'d center the text more the div with the gray background with thin black border,, \\'i\\'m a developer, etc..\\'  the text is hugging the left side i love how fall just drops in. it\\'s freakin cold all of the sudden well, i guess it\\'s hot  what\\'s \\'it\\' ? it\\'s still cold weather that is,  (all this thermodynamic talk) lol well, @lawlietblack it\\'s not so bad, but the sudden shift is lame like, ta-da: it\\'s fall but then tomorrow it could,  easily, be 90...  don\\'t forget regex  and/or .split that\\'s a really bad photoshop of kanye (i hope, if not scary): his head doesn\\'t fit his body (which you could argue is his overall issue) wait, are you using github to sign in or was your last login before fcc switched curriculum?  @hannekoppelman  you have to delete one of those accounts (there should be instructions at the login page) you\\'re progress is still there help sign in grrr, or was it help accounts sigh hey @camperbot (dcsan) ; what\\'s the wiki entry for the login issues for folks that signed up pre-beta? emoticons are pure evil (thanks unicode) very nice @chocobowings  i know people that \\'speak\\' in nothing but emoticons camperbot does seem to invoke that a lot hello, microsoft  your automatic activation # failed again,  let me go through my life story  oh, yes, i can help you i think camperbot said that you could only use bezier curves. as it (camperbot) declared rectangles to be banned. (its cruel like that, all the ai power and all) lol ducking lol i didn\\'t know the term palindrome prior to fcc this explains david copperfield i always wondered what it was wait there\\'s actually a meaning to that kansas song?  i\\'ve never considered palindromes to be that important to my understanding of the universe radiohead = good stuff toto = sum cr^^ that always came on the radio after eddie money i saw them before bssm came out. they were still edgy (a far cry from lip syncing their nfl appearance)  @danstockham he was bad in jane\\'s addiction brain stew, simple  great song merpeople (fish?) wasabi cher? ok please,  before another random list of songs go by,  ask your technical question @codefiasco , post the code help formatting code sandwich: paste (your code) between the backticks i\\'m going to use this cool feature called colapse ah, life better i think chris farley almost was neo, but they chose keanu  deer are big rats you drink the vinegar, then curse the deer? i mean that could be effective these are some rather unconventional gardening tips you could play cher (on of your list choices) over loudspeaker. i\\'m sure they\\'d run like hell one of yes, js fundamental to stack i can see the deer now.... \\'no, that garden is a no-go\\' they\\'re playing cher... \\'what are our options, then? well we can starve) lol i\\'m getting used to js....  (and its \\'laid back\\' paradigm good/bad) codecademy\\'s basic js is bad (like shi^^y bad) codecademy\\'s angular = good  ,  codecademy\\'s basic js = bad no lol different usage/application js isn\\'t the right tool for everything cats when in doubt, cats no liear liar the original i am legend (was, a 70s version called something else) it was funny plus is also a concatenat(or)  confusing counter with index? yes, but you\\'re wanting to skip the first (n) elements in the array the regex (and all of its different variants of \\'thanks\\') for camperbot, should include an explanation of why (if you want to thank somebody)  --   @arielleslie same here, (it\\'s kind of an ai version of butting into somebody\\'s convo).... but it should be less vague if it\\'s going to be rude lol i don\\'t do a lot of gaming, but \\'gaming\\' psu are great for any tower you can run linux off an external drive, but not windows (technically) same here,  (confused) what\\'s the intended gain from an external? the (most notable) performance gain with ssd comes if your os resides on the ssd with the ssd, you\\'re going to (also) want more memory (not related, but more of a \\'while you\\'re at it\\' type of thing) what it doesn\\'t do: spin ouch. 1tb pricey.... you could get a smaller ssd for primary , and some cra^^ cheaper drives for storage  lol than ssd drives? most towers (standard) have at least two bays some have more.... (you can also, go external) oh, laptop nvm you\\'re sc^^^^^ed yes very warner brothers i could count carets (which is the actual spelling) ^^^^^^^ mountains hmmm asterisks are reserved gitter formatting chars that looks like an inverted album cover of simple minds: don\\'t you (forget about me) bye @ashiantfb  they have \\'gaming\\' laptops (they\\'re insanely expensive though) get ready for more bloat (no user intervention for updates) banished windows to vm long ago at least on primary machine your os may revolt when referring to it as such lol you may find \\'cortana\\' greeting you with \\'i heard what you said about me\\', so i just decided to a fresh upgrade to your system lol, yes... banish cortana\\n\\n ms is marketing their office products to other platforms, i wonder if they\\'re a)realizing that their os market share is slipping or b)they\\'re betting that they don\\'t need (said office products, which i would argue, is the reason a lot of orgs keep windows at the desktop level (there are other, good, ms offerings though) you should be more clear in your feelings about the tutorial @joepurdy agree, there\\'s also the volume licensing  i think you\\'d get more (positive) feedback to your question if you explain what aspects suck (then that could help gauge what you\\'re looking for in terms of alternatives) i\\'m jumping ahead a bit but an example (one of the pens) got me thinking about json.... you can \\'walk through\\' json stuff but what\\'s jquery \\'wrapper\\' for this? i.e., basic high-level that\\'s a pretty healthy self assessment  it\\'s easy to get sidetracked with all of the technologies\\n i think the demise of the laptop is a bit further out... yes i still remember the laptop ah, the original thinkpad nice not only is that thing not forgotten, it\\'s sought after grandma has good taste the cloud is based on hardware, just somebody else\\'s... argues against not having consumer hardware so, sensei  tell me about bootstrap again  sarcasm lost hi @srlhyo  @zersiax ,  what kind of fix? (sounds interesting)  no he\\'s not or \\'its\\' it just does that to mask its real intelligence  lol bots don\\'t recognize brownie intent lol hey @jbmartinez  that is awsome @zersiax , accessibility in design is an important aspect to things js, jquery, angular ...will be fun @srlhyo  speak softly carry big font help formatting i use  code sandwich backticks are the bread, code is the turkey. hand model or wannabe hand model there\\'s too much competition for that kind of modelling  @dasgingy paste what you\\'ve got so far don\\'t do it it\\'s like being sam in the movie ghost that was quick, code then no code @semachka bring the code back nobody ever listens to the fish-eye-dude...  troutman was a lesser known dc superhero retiring from modeling? i\\'m waiting for the day the camperbot says: \\'you know what? i\\'m tired of handing out brownies\\' lol yes, there\\'s a planet icon at top of screen i like multi-city wiki tuna recipes sigh oh, well... i guess i\\'ll have to go back to traversing json @jbmartinez  i think so too one can\\'t live on code alone (which is where the tuna recipes come in... ) not if it\\'s a portal to other services @jbmartinez  or, a static login page wait, nvm if it\\'s a static login.... more centered and less nav would be good angular says the check is in the mail i\\'m learning it too @mrhormonas did you try outputing user.data into console (or alert) to see what you\\'re getting? nvm alert bad (very) in a loop.... you\\'re pulling it from json no? with @jrchandler i don\\'t the answer.... maybe it\\'s your list variable that\\'s calling divs without a specifier ? (i\\'d like to know answer too) np @jrchandler  if i had known nothing other than js maybe i\\'d have less issues with js wow, that\\'s some bad stuff (malbroge) good grief if you say lurk it takes away from the stealth factor oh, got ya i don\\'t dislike js.....  i think there\\'s a plus sign out of place lol it\\'s like a bit of everything thrown in without the rules (js).  the things you can\\'t do in other languages throws me off when \\'js\\' mode cool ok, it\\'s cool (literally) again... ok, fall... are you coming or not? (stop messing with me already, darn season) where\\' s the love for angular? i\\'m trying to learn it, and everybody hates (or close to) it is angular a good entry point into frameworks(s) (i.e., yes... it can \\'suck\\' as a day-to-day tool, but does it have some conceptual elements) now i feel bad for angular (in an anthropomorphic kind of way)  i feel like i need to go angular before react.... (i can guarantee that i\\'ll be looking over react docs before the week is out) that\\'s a good motivator someone mentioned materializecss the other day, i looked at the page, it can turn static buttons into <li>stuff</>  to be honest, i liked the whole materialize thing but if i have to do windows95 then i will if you have a righteous hamburger then i\\'d say yes the codecademy course is not written well.. yes, it doesn\\'t hold your hand... and yes, it doesn\\'t maintain consistency in examples or logic either they should market camperbot bobbleheads  i know you\\'re envisioning it  lol  that\\'s so wrong yes, camperbot... how do you feel about bobbleheads with your likeness? i\\'m somehow envisioning laser cannons (camperbot\\'s undocumented hardware) powering up. lol dots have a more atari feel what? no batman either no way if you feel like batman, then you\\'re batman but batman is not very conversational i still think my troutman (or troutperson) idea is better than the current crop of superheros  are catwoman\\'s eyebrows part of her mask? why does that version of catwoman have pirate boots i would say while is not a good approach...  lack of input is the natural state  of things bye what\\'s the salad dressing with a lot of anchovies ? the 0 value after % is confusing (non-standard?) hi @ng-martin  can\\'t you omit? @jbmartinez  always, stingy with the keystrokes  lol i was looking at mdn just now,  css is fun like a root canal @ng-martin  there\\'s no queue ask away use incognito tab to access eat much oatmeal sugar cookies are the best (without all the c^^p just plain) sugar cookies are like sashimi, coffee, and news (best served right away)  i think @julianaramburu is on to something: sure it\\'s not \\'get\\'? forismatic\\'s (api) callback function example(s) are in russian i gathered that @michael-krebs (lol) what did you break? oh, cr^^ @mansour-ahmed that\\'s in the (padded) request, i\\'m talking about their example documentation @oab00\\'s example is closer to what you need (based on all the examples, i\\'ve seen) i don\\'t know but i think if you leave the callback empty it\\'s suppossed to auto generate,  and other examples state that you\\'re going to need the callback (yours, defined) to parse the return data  touchscreens on laptops noooo laptop screens are supposed to be pristine not all gunked up with fingerprints and ramen powder my favorite, is people leaning over a desk and touching your screen \\'you mean that, thingy there?\\'  i think that\\'s where you define a callback to parse all that stuff that @joepurdy  is listing that api seems a little sketchy @joepurdy makes me wonder if question a) should be: should i use this api (vs. how do i use this api) when doing some of this stuff lol ?? now it\\'s cold again.... southeast @joepurdy same here, i saw it in an example of somebody\\'s codepen i\\'m nowhere near the beach do i wear flannel or not? weather, please be consistent what happens (here in nc) is it\\'s chilly, then one wears flannel. then it gets hot all of a sudden-- then one ends up tying said flannel around waist... then one looks like an extra from a 1980s skid row video depends  paste \\'th the code \\'th it shouldn\\'t matter because it\\'s enclosed in quotes, but oscar wilde\\'s quote has a semicolon  @luishendrix92  has a clean version of example, but your question @itch96 was what does error signify (the original post\\'s copied version had all kinds of junk... i\\'m going to go with the semicolon.. who\\'s with me? lol) @luishendrix92  you may need to escape that character yo coding while distracted is not as bad as all that stuff  lol are you really? i think i have some work to do, one dumb question before i go:  can you edit (displayed instance) of codepen examples that are posted without messing those up? (i.e., am assuming since you\\'re not logged in as the poster, any changes would be browser session based)...  hey @jbmartinez  and thanks @michael-krebs  ah, the regex doesn\\'t discern that\\'s funny, @jbmartinez  no problem... one t h a n k s in string is interpreted to apply to all user names in string  i was so close, to getting some work done jif is the best @thedigitalmonk i like the \\'moving background\\' now i want jif jif is evil, i\\'m sure i could eat a whole jar < 24 hours welcome @noobdeveloper22  free trials should be without caveats  like, it\\'s free but we want your cc f that apple and google are morphing into what ms was historically yeah, @jbmartinez  i think eu folks are suing all over the place there\\'s a converter that you can swap out an old dvd drive with an additional hard drive (a lot of things don\\'t have a dvd drive) firefox still has the best dev tools (imo) chrome is fast (i use it) but for dev ff still rocks  i don\\'t like apple\\'s \\'ecosystem\\'  go linux @thedigitalmonk  apple is if i choose to use their hardware... the choice really is subjective, (a lot of folks who use apple aren\\'t aware they don\\'t have so much \\'choice\\') lol @jbmartinez  @thedigitalmonk that includes their products like music  ubuntu is awsome install it in a vm give it a go @lawlietblack you need to give your guest more memory what kind of desktop? unity, kde? i used to do conky config files love em when using puppy linux back in the day loved kubuntu is great  i do too, (although i get all gnome ish sometimes , and switch to mate) screen edges you\\'ll never go back that\\'s wrong lol you can recycle old hardware with linux (some distros are better than others in terms of \\'weight\\') this is great for getting folks \\'plugged in\\' no love for perl? lol you can apply the same logic to perl vs. python although, not tasty i\\'m going to learn perl  i am yes lol that\\'s why it\\'s useful lol having a command (no pun intended) of an esoteric language is righteous  i promise not to gouge my eyes out with bananas oooh i am undeterred by the completly insane loop logic of perl was looking over some syntax examples, now i can\\'t spell  i wonder what many hours of perl syntax will do to me hiya @stinger25  i think it\\'s the time of year that\\'s a great song i didn\\'t play it for fear that it would be like mr. roboto (never ending chorus loop in my head) multitasking  @danielmw34 you may want to paste your code full code...  help formatting code sandwich = backticks are the bread code is the turkey that\\'s what i finally settled on, (i used variants with hamburgers, but tried to adjust for vegans (even though turkey isn\\'t , well , vegan) backticks are the bread code is the lettuce? ok, nvm.   the regex is looking for all the whitespaces then the count (looks like) is performed on the number of whitespaces on the returned \\'string\\' via length if i have to go gluten free, my bread example is going to fall apart hmmm you might get \\\\t (tab)  but yes i think that should work... could be wrong though just based on your question (not taking into account any requirements) @gaindacode , look at different examples... questions that people pose, it begins to make sense (i say begins, ) and yeah, code some stuff... and.... always make sure your coffee is warm i\\'d still drink it (not preferred but you do what you have to) i made the mistake of trying to think of js objects of in terms of class (this always makes for interesting reading, i already know this is wrong (in thinking) but i had to go the route of namespace too) hi @tiffberryman  welcome to you too @hambacneggs  now i want bacon, thanks lol i wish i could get the vision of ham and eggs (darn screen name) out of my mind. some really good over easy eggs,  (i wasn\\'t kidding lol)   i love the key clamps at home depot (\\'not for climbing\\' imprinted ,  i\\'m like yeah, no kidding) that\\'s my favorite too, (and the international graphic on a lawnmower of foot in blade)....so, many product warnings in a highly litigious society (or societies)  nooooo i just got over ham and eggs where are the coding questions? aren\\'t there like 50,000 people here right now? lol ^where are the semi-reasonable coding questions i don\\'t understand the pauses like yes, most folks are multitasking (e.g, working, doing waypoints, cooking eggs) but there are these long periods of inactivity (with a huge number of users) pretty much all except the eggs which i\\'m really wishing i could do now don\\'t bale on angular  lol would that be ansi c or c, c? c is interesting for its fine control of memory... have a c book, sometimes am tempted to run through it i am and that was the next thing @curlifair  @shifthawke i\\'m pretty much limited to bojangles at the moment yeah i want eggs, but not a cup of oil poured over then i have to get moist towelettes (which guaranteed there will be none left)  sure, @arktikh  i\\'d first narrow it down to the language that you\\'re most interested  then look for conventions, (coding is too broad) humility? just kidding maybe api familiarity   and maybe by extension problem solving skills (i.e., what to do when geo is declined) and update it manually too not weather, but i\\'d say the quote api could go on that list actionscript3 in download prominence seems kind of weird (and language support for examples, is another) ( something tells me this an inherent quality in \\'no key\\' apis) nooo i think camperbot also goes by other names no, i think his (camperbot) other name is beelzbub lol yes, now we\\'re bickering over electronic brownies (bitcoin doesn\\'t seem so crazy now) get 100 more and you get a free  microwave popcorn pouch are you running it on virtualbox or vmware? i leave for an hour, and convo degrades into brownie points and ascii art wtf?  lol ^^^^ (((( sorry, trying to go with the flow i don\\'t either are you saying (begrudgingly gets pulled into emoji convo) that there are undocumented emoji? like easter eggs of emoji in gitter  you could also check if the unicode (code) will render in gitter markup `u+1f608`\\n u+1f608\\n <p>this a test &#1f608;<p> crap <p>this a test &#1f608;</p> lol  can i only use \\'gitter markup\\' ? nice try to use camperbot as an html formatter lol 😈 i barely pass the turing test i hate copy/paste (too easy) i want to directly render a friggin unicode  now i\\'m so pi^^^d. who started the emoji topic?  lol no, they are not sufficient the fact that there\\'s a limited set of options, makes one want more you\\'d have to have a jet car yeah, i even tried a different variant it can also mean that you\\'re calling a function that hasn\\'t been declared like renderthisfrigginemoticon() ```\\nvar somestring = \"bob\";\\n``` yep\\n but careful with implicit conversion one of the js \\'gems\\' sorry somestring lol it\\'s like a camel meacamel it makes variables easier to read (i\\'m lazy) i use all lowercase to make things interesting and left justify  python folks love that  lol are you using fcc or some alternate learning site  you\\'re right (about the waypoint) i do that constantly (snake case) i have to keep myself from using underscores in subject lines long subject lines with reserved  characters drive me crazy (i see it all the time) @joepurdy i wouldn\\'t doubt it ladder @stinger25  huh? was it the ladder joke? then there\\'s svn to do (technology) list keeps growing it\\'s like a giant cat like 500ft tall cat haven\\'t watched the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xpnkhjaok8 it item# 596 on my list it\\'s honestly, high level (at conceptual level) talks help me more in some cases  so, the quotes/weather examples (api stuff) have got me thinking about jsonp (i realize a lot of this is limited to \\'get\\' vs. \\'post\\') but what\\'s the widespread usage/applicability of this (jsonp) given some of the security implications?   @0x0936 , i think you may be on to something... full flannel day. i think it\\'s fall at least for another hour, then it will not be but, it will not be freezing in an hour heads one = is for assignment btw but your lesson could fail on the string comparison \"head\" vs. \"heads\" too @shakejunk  syntax errors (and typos) are really a pain: you essentially have a cyborg english professor (that is ever vigilant and doesn\\'t make mistakes) checking your code when you hit submit  @pkneeland78  can you post the link to that waypoint? so, here\\'s a hint: you have some missing elements in your addclass declaration btn-primary should (at least in my case with the exercise) should appear (separate by spaces) in each .addclass along with the other stuff @julianaramburu lol it\\'s really sensitive @julianaramburu, i\\'ve had to pause my \\'return finger behavior\\'   @pkneeland78  so, what was the final resolution? hi, @stuartbridges  every time i see/hear the word \\'noob\\' (or its variants) i think of p. cox from scrubs or \\'newbie\\' are you looking for a custom date format? (i.e., without the gmt)? i don\\'t \\nknow of a simple built-in function but here are a couple of links: 1.\\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3552461/how-to-format-a-javascript-date,\\n2. don\\'t hate on the ms (it\\'s just an example) https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff743760(v=vs.94).aspx the auto formatting added 1. to the indentation regex is awsome cryptic but seriously powerful regex + sed was a very profound thing when working with large text/data files... (at least for me) stream editor (linux or *nix like) yeah, regex is (and am no guru) is language agnostic @julianaramburu , turn brain off and fake it @julianaramburu http://www.regexr.com/ and https://regex101.com/ the second link is particulary handy. @ami190  that\\'s a whole cadre of separate (but related) items, what are you installing specifically? @ami190, don\\'t know about the link (or even what operating system you\\'re using), but there are a lot of things (like dependencies, etc.,) that are probably beyond the scope of this help (channel?).   @ami190 , i would first narrow your search to operating system, if you\\'re on linux... there are tutorials out there. my guess would be that you\\'re second search block would be specific to help with dependency issues (search this broad topic by some of the linux boards)... you\\'re essentially installing separate components etc..   backend does have design aspects, it\\'s more behind the scenes and not immediately perceptible to the end user    @ami190 that sucks. linux has a better approach to resolving dependencies (but not always trouble free if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing)... you could try installing your stack into a vm depends on what backend you\\'re talking about @burressdesign i have to agree yeah, i know it sounded kind of odd. anything with \\'backend\\' in it has the potential for jokes   see like that wrong (funny, but wrong) lol here\\'s the thing, take amazon (this is my fav example) it\\'s not the front-end that drives its functionallity or usefulness hey, i\\'m earthbound too. (we have so much in common already) btw, hey @thiagoferreir4  haven\\'t seen you around in a while i\\'m glad you got a gig! @thiagoferreir4  they\\'ve since (also) put your name as an example on one of the exercises... so, now you\\'ve got a gig and you\\'re a rock star...  (don\\'t be like elvis take it in stride lol) what joke ? oh, this is good uh, huh though i make fun of camperbot, ai (actual) is something that i\\'m interested now i\\'m think of weird al yes, there\\'s like a 100% chance that this room would get that reference to weird al lol it\\'s a take off on riding dirty that weird al did .... (funny as he^^) takeoff  @burressdesign , i wonder that too (about the formatting) weeeid ahhhh i meant weird see what you started @shifthawke  oh, it\\'s an evil gitter thing oh, you typed it alright lol codename har ahr he actually was complemented on his rap skills in that spoof  klingon  rolling just remembered that part i\\'m so close to youtubing this again (when i first saw it (way back) i watched it over and over) @qmikew1 karma, karma, karma, chameleon  yeah, it is a neat featur e boolean is true or false (or 0 , 1) what context is the length aspect? (i.e., it wouldn\\'t be applicable unless there\\'s some additional thing that you\\'re doing (not described)   which wp? you\\'ll find string length very applicable (it\\'s a basic handy thing) to a lot of stuff on the flip side isnan will be handy too i need coffee  like now that would be the coffee size that i want and answer..... \\'no idea\\' i sold my soul to starbucks long ago it was at these old crossroads i thought it was soup i\\'m like what the he^^ is that oh, marshmallows.... (i seriously thought dumplings) there is the  righteouslycomplexwheather.js api that you could use camperbot\\'s fallback is to give brownie points.... when it gets into awkward situations it goes: \"um, yeah... here\\'s a brownie, let\\'s move on\" lol that\\'s one of the things about ai (camperbot isn\\'t (it\\'s more regex parser as @0x0936 points out), there\\'s an infinite amount of subtly that ai can\\'t deal not directly related but i tried wrapping my brain around: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuzzy_logic - a few years back around the same time as weird al\\'s epic video i was just thinking that while looking at my paragraph (i.e.., invasion of the body snatchers screaming \"nerd\"!)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gestsljzhzo hey @jbmartinez ! polar opposites: kirk and picard what do you mean download?

(i.e., in reg mode, you can mess up a lot) looks pretty good, just don\\'t like the outlines around the images when the pad is clicked howdy @alberto8899  it changes but does a lot on the bottom two pads, for a while take blue button (css) i think the opacity on its border shoes up when selected totally random.   depends on the context geany, notepad++ (if i\\'m in vm), sublime (although i\\'m not sure whether i like sublime or not) i\\'m thinking about brackets can do some interesting stuff with calls ugh, powershell honestly bash (or terminal version of commands/utilities in linux)is easier than powershell i remember .bat files still have a windows vm (there are some things you still need windows for) that\\'s true, there are also things that you can only  do from powershell (like access dir tree of a network resource (admin command console standard will complain) @saadanerdetbare that\\'s a deal breaker...

(news stations do that ) so, it could be a really large possum for all we know sounds like a hoax (although you may want to hold off on carrying a plate of pork-chops around the edge of the woods) did you apply @jbmartinez \\'s configurations (and then adapt the permissions from link example)? is codepen https://? also, @tesla809  you may need to refresh your page (there seems to be some disagreement on this) after updating file wasn\\'t the suggestion to use: header set access-control-allow-origin \"*\" it\\'s been a long time since i messed with apache but http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/apachectl.html (you may want to try apachectl configtest) the idea, is to check if the edits (to your file) will throw an error ..... what were you wanting to do again? (fonts? lol) are these custom fonts? (i.e., why would there be a middleman site for widely available fonts) ugh a dollar well spent lol no idea, the cert part was added recently (i think) @tesla809 , if you\\'re going to run an actual local server... you\\'re going to need to read up on administration (seriously) -- i could read up on it too (it\\'s a good thing to do even if not implemented)  @jbmartinez thank you for taking a break during \\'apache config hour\\'  (convenient ) lol cheetos i read that as tuna lol it\\'s stunna  i would eat a tuna salad brownie sandwich in a heartbeat  😿 @julianaramburu  i\\'m making myself use emotes (i will bother with context next week) i saw pizza pablano day better oh, now i\\'m starving thanks oh, camperbot you\\'re such a spam-o-tron like shift hawke  arrays with shift add the hawke oh, nvm i need a deep fryer  like the mini version then i can churn out all kinds of healthy snacks super healthy don\\'t believe all the hype about deep fried foods lol they\\'re all lies tempura breading is the key shaving off your eyebrows seems a bit extreme oh, lord so, yeah am also learning angular (vain attempt to redirect rapidly degrading convo) lol so, have the aliens taken all of you? @tommyosh  are you thinking in other language paradigms?  (this is difficult concept for me too, at times) it\\'s easier (in the broader context of different languages) but it\\'s weird in javascript  yeah that\\'s why @mindfulbell  how are you implementing that regex? how would you implement that on a large (non-static string) ... (i.e., you\\'d have to know the lengths in advance of the thing to be camel-cased)  yeah, i get that part,  but that regex is set to g say i wanted to do this: abcdeffrrrzzzzzz  there\\'s no way i could know in advance abcdeffrrrzzzzzz that that would occur in say abcdeffrrrzzzzzzthis is a testabc00000deffrrrzzzzzz with random patterns of ucase lcase  the \\'where\\' to put the camel-case is too random right but that\\'s not the problematic part it\\'s this  thisisastring  how would you determine (again, not a static string just for kicks) how would you determine thisisastring  on just those parameters  maybe you\\'re thinking of a particular exercise/example string (i might be thinking of something else).. i was just saying that on a dynamic/random string that camel-case with regex would not work (because without a hint char) because there isn\\'t necessarily a pattern to be matched. it\\'s like  what do i name my taco (which i wish i had) today? could be : larry could be bart... it\\'s random i\\'m not asking anything oh, you\\'re looking for such (i.e., a camel-case) not trying to do a replace that make more sense:  like find  thisisastring  yeah, i thought somebody was trying to apply camel-case (i.e., in assignment) logic to a random string (how would you determine where the camel-casing would occur: it\\'s a human assignment on some level) @dting, i haven\\'t had enough sugar  lol @jbmartinez , interesting question though.... i think you could theoretically, do dictionary matches on a string and find word boundaries in no space strings like thispartofstring in ai (would be one heck of an exercise for not a lot in return) lol   it\\'s cold as cr^^ here now @hiltydiggs ,  you couldn\\'t do it in one pass... (i was thinking the same thing about 1,2 letter words) where\\'s your sense of adventure? there are other fields like that as well keep the corn fields, need cheetos no, my keyboards are pristine even the hint of oil on my keyboard drives me ^^^^^^^ nuts so, i use this special cleaner on it made with oranges and possum spit pouchaorange oh, sure add to the list vanilla comes from a plant other than the outcry , do you think people are going to order a vanilla-bean frap from beaver butts? i\\'m going to go way out on a limb and say: \\'no\\' ok, strike one flavor of drinks and ice cream off list no it\\'s three weeks ahead here throw out a technical question so, you like php, need to learn more javascript and you\\'re ready to start angular ? you\\'re narrowing your choices down  yeah, i went off on journey to codeschool with angular... then to codecademy (i.e., no homegrown angular) ahhh, what is this seattle? nc is freezing and rainy wtf without the hip factor good grief, it\\'s going to be raining for the next week i\\'m going to increase the cpu load so, that little fan blows some hot air (it\\'s dam^ cold gotta do what you gotta do) that would be cool and cool it too (but only with electricity ) yeah built in attrition yeah, i was going to say that\\'s what you\\'re encouraged to do. if you think through the examples that you find (because are you going to magically come up with the knowledge?) and apply it in different ways, that\\'s not cheating (unless you\\'re pasting somebody\\'s answer) mdn is awesome (but sometimes they way round to get to point (i.e., very technically astute but a bit long-winded sometimes)) let\\'s see there\\'s goat herding, hand modeling, and one other possible career alternative huh, no that\\'s not it do you have to pass it by &#176; perhaps oh, yeah msn... wow that brings back memories lol butterfly logo welcome @glenwperry  it gets even neater da^^ solution to what? yes that\\'s a lot stuff i would help but i have a scroll limit so, is there a clue or shall we evaluate the entire page? lol i don\\'t miss dial-up (or its sound) just like i don\\'t miss the classic motorola phone that was almost literally the size of a brick had the \\'slim version\\' mine was even worse, don\\'t even know where to begin the lookup ah, the orange glow it was extraordinarily expensive to use a cell in the mid 90s.  there was this message from mobile carrier \"please deposit kidney\" i was like what? convos went like this: \\'sup\\', \\'sup\\' . ok, i gotta go now that was like $20.00 @cobunny  do you have a codepen of this thing? don\\'t make @jbmartinez write the whole da^^ thing for you lol oh, i remember the audio tape thing (kinda) i thought it was cool i hated stacks of floppies just as an aside @qmikew1 and wordstar then what happens? (or is intended to happen but is not) i think you can still buy those they still sell vhs tapes  too the weather (not anybody\\'s zipline, but literally the) sucks the temp\\'s not so bad, but it\\'s been raining (and will continue) a lot yeah, have one... wish for the other i was just looking at codepen, it looks like the pro version has asset hosting. how much is this? oh, i finally found the pricing page (when you have to externally search something, that\\'s a hint) but wait! not only to you get 20 boxes of pro tuna salad.... you get! (if you order now) nice. back to the day of a \\'more civilized age\\' when people manually gave each other weather yeah, it sucks (i can\\'t think of an obi-wan quote) south ga? you mean northern fl ? lol here, in xanadu and you thought weather wasn\\'t interesting lol i love the \\'real feel\\' part of weather bc it can \\'really feel pretty cra^^^\\' for one and \\'really feel moderately cra^^^\\' for another  they have these weather stations you can put on your deck (or lanai what have you) no, i think it\\'s totally subjective: can\\'t charge fees without \\'real feel\\' @shifthawke that wp actually gives you the answer put them back and read the instructions lol just reading the description is interesting (i.e., in the url) ie is what drove me to firefox (in the way back days) @maciejsartys , i was kind of in the same mode of thought.... there\\'s aws (free tier maybe?) and a bunch of other stuff (search ), also... codepen has a pro version that enables one to host assets (seems a little pricey though imo vs. using a hosting service proper)  great too yeah i see a lot of imgur in the examples doesn\\'t hurt to do the exercises though i didn\\'t know that cats were such an important part of web dev makes me wonder if they, in fact, invented it do you have to (also) place a webkit marker in there? cats: the internet (and everything else) overlords  too rainy it will (the eclipse) happen in near anonymity for my neck of the woods  @jordanbourne do you have a codepen of this? ok, i was like what am i missing yep, you can just hit refresh and the changes are updated looking at it the container part has a lot of auto, and relative coords,  are you trying to factor the other element\\'s transform coordinates? (not sure that you\\'re getting the kind of relative that you\\'re seeking) @jordanbourne yeah, i think it\\'s more of a rebuild, just messing with that element got a bunch of weird results... (like to see your solution on the rebuild (edification wise)) sometimes js is easier  nice work @shifthawke  don\\'t encourage lol i actually don\\'t start any such jokes. (in fact, i can\\'t even bring myself to spell out things like: cra^^^) i was in my own little \\'debug css world\\' and look what you\\'ve done minding my own business hi, @tiagomaial  are you still trying to go down the php route? hey, palindrome  db i am and i love my avatar no clue you can blame gimp gradients but i like the final result mongo is not a relational db i could breakdown codd\\'s theories but, first do some reading on relational dbs then you can do comparisons among vendors etc. mongo isn\\'t \\'relational\\' (i.e., things broken down into separate tables with relations, keys, etc.. (again, do some reading) is more of a \\'document\\' type thing for json like retrieval  i like my avatar btw yep well, you\\'ll get some amount of disagreement (japanese vs. chinese interpretation) but serenity or bagels  i was going for bagels yeah, they\\'re round yeah, they\\'re pretty tasty with capers and .... wait, i\\'m talking about bagels wtf lol they\\'re pickled flower buds (i think, i should read the ingredients on things more often)  http://homecooking.about.com/od/cookingfaqs/f/faqcapers.htm hiya @codewarren  oh, not bad @codewarren .... just going over relational db(s) and capers contrast and compare which one? i would start with the waypoint lessons you\\'ll gradually get a feel for what you need to expand upon @codewarren , my guess is that curriculum (although, different folks have different experience with a number of technologies) is aimed at folks that share your starting point. so, go with it (the curriculam: should point you where you need to go)  the pine trees are crashing my browser what kind of script is being run in the pine trees? same here... @abhisekp  what\\'s up with the trees? i switched back and forth, my guess is that chrome is running out of processes because there\\'s a loop to display those trees over and over (add elements) - not cool sigh, no @abhisekp  lol do you really want to make your server an \\'outlaw font server\\'? use a fallback (or fork over the dough to whatever api - save yourself the headache) yeah, but \"*\" doesn\\'t just restrict their (font) usage to codepen did it work? i\\'m not sure that you can give finite (maybe you can) control of cross-domain stuff... so, you may be limited to \"*\" or nothing (in which case go to my first comment lol)  making an unbeatable game? hawkebot ah, @abhisekp i knew it had something to do with % but i thought (30) was in the main url: http://gizmodo.com/why-one-random-web-address-can-crash-chrome-1732731055 no no your code that\\'s ok did you work it out?

(bad question to pose with programmers, you may actually get an answer) if geo is denied, there doesn\\'t seem to be a rendering fallback (you can also, (separate topic) use an ip fallback) i\\'ve got a button and one td ok, so i set to accept geo, still just a button and an empty td.... let me see if your pen renders differently in a different browser nope two browsers, still no dice...  @theviajerock , already did that, i see the outputs of your console.log() statements  looks good (value wise)\\n\\nla latitud es: //blocked this out\\nla longitud es: //blocked this out\\nthe time is: 18\\nla temperatura en celcius es: 22.21\\nla temperatura en fahrenheit es: 71.97800000000001 but still not rendering, which is odd totally (weird),  la latitud es: //myblock// index.html:440\\nla longitud es: //myblock// index.html:441\\nthe landscape is light-rain index.html:456\\nthe time is: 18 index.html:469\\nla temperatura en celcius es: 22.21 index.html:470\\nla temperatura en fahrenheit es: 71.97800000000001 index.html:471 440 should be significant nvm, thinking something else oh, a bento (lunch) would be so good @theviajerock nope, no dice. i took all of the css out, of my (local) version of pen, and all the data was populated correctly into table there could be something related to the image hosting (i\\'d bet a dollar) you can only have one id (it\\'s a, well,  unique identifier) this will make more sense as you go along  @theviajerock you\\'re in luck (i still had your pen in another tab) refreshed, and it works! great work you changed this line: .rain, .light-rain-day, .light-rain-night, .light-rain-day .light-rain-night{ in your css file well, you could try the pre 2000 approach to web design @theviajerock , it\\'s where there\\'s absolutely no dynamic elements and there are really bad js flashing elements everywhere or putting everything in tables for layout purposes i had navigator and (later) when i \\'upgraded\\' from 3.1 to win98 i was like yeah that same machine (i tried many years ago, and it\\'s gone) could barely run puppy linux wow, mosaic gitter is scroll challenged so, this is a repository project.... i\\'m seeing activity relating to t-shirts... (are there said t-shirts available ?) oooh, nice... don\\'t worry about the streak don\\'t barf it\\'s not covered by warranty don\\'t do it..... the pause had me wondering if you actually barfed on said computer which would be bad choose rug over computer (although rug can be really expensive too) the streak means nothing  (seriously ) what about when you encounter a difficult bf @coltonehrman they should sink (there\\'s an additional step that you have to take, there should be a message at the bottom of login page on how to do that) i edit my response, even though i had it right the first time..... (second guessing) duh it looked weird \\'they\\' vs. \\'the\\' @shifthawke , have you hurled yet? drink oj? sleep for many hours? hurling sucks drink hot ramen toss the noodles , drink the broth put some lemon in it (and maybe a little garlic) nooooooo  egg bad that\\'s why you\\'re going to hurl try it again (without the egg) you want to avoid: eggs,  large onions with cheddar and sauerkraut ok, i can bend on the cheddar ... but avoid eggs and sauerkraut when ill lol sauerkraut, directly translated: \"sour cabbage\", is finely cut cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria, including leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and pediococcus. (ewwww, see don\\'t do it) @jbmartinez that is neat,  so when are you going to send the email? is there a pool of completed candidates? like a room (e.g., we\\'re done, now what?) you know, a pre-processing list of potential programming partners (who\\'ve met the first set of criteria in completing stuff) would be helpful (could be different ways to implement) that way they\\'d be evaluating \\'the team\\' i\\'m totally thinking talent metrics now @shifthawke did you try the hot ramen broth suggestion? @abhisekp did they patch it yet? weird, and it was only chrome (no ff or midori ) @abhisekp how did you append the offending crash element to the valid url? did you go back and edit after  @abhisekp yeah, that\\'s the one (where you had the image first )lol @shifthawke , noooo you have to  or it will get worse yes garlic,, pop it in the micro for a few seconds peel and eat i eat way too much garlic addictive as cra^ do it i jump between both.... ff has better dev tools but chrome is faster eat-the-garlic, eat-the-garlic. chant/repeat although, there was some benchmark that had ff closing gap in speed sometimes use \\'bleeding edge\\' nightly builds on ff yeah, i use it when i\\'m feeling adventuras wtf, that\\'s not how you spell that lol spell check no worky i\\'m too tired to raise my mouse pointer to edit nooooo yeah, you\\'ve seen @shifthawke , now it\\'s \\'shifthawke on nyquil\\' great wow, faster than i expected lol that\\'s so wrong i suggested garlic and you went nyquil you can buy garlic in nc oh, don\\'t do that besides, it\\'s not garlic and nyquil just garlic. too late thanks @coltonehrman  yes or eat half a clove which is what i recommend got codepen? i told you cats run the internet @shifthawke i would go with the horse sized duck yeah, but that\\'s just one giant bill,,,, vs. a thousand chances with the other option (unless the callback is some custom formatting thing that you\\'re doing) now i want sauerkraut (even though, i\\'ve found out that they add bacteria to it) totally didn\\'t know that i could have gone the rest of my life without knowing that (kraut = bacteria) next thing you know they will be adding it to yogurt (wait, they...) i prefer not to read the labels on food although i love sashimi/sushi , and it\\'s teaming with all kinds of cra^  agree @jbmartinez  i still would go with the horse sized duck quack a perfect circle eh?  (best song was written by failure (band)) nope, linux primary- windows in vm where it should be (banished to vm) kde rocks is that conky right upper left tried it, didn\\'t like it (fedora) total nc camperbot is a lot like tgi fridays on a birthday tear <-plugged into hive.... waiting for laser eye implant and ride on cube ship step 1 mars has non-frozen water flowing about yep, good for pickling us earth people (sorry martians, no offense)  why? you can emulate the living conditions on mars (right here on earth with a cra^^y apartment) i don\\'t want to live in a can out in space... (for like a year) then live in a cra^^^ can on mars. for the rest of my days (which would probably be short, on a nearly lifeless(?) planet) your friends are, likely, designer types. they don\\'t know javascript.  wow, fast moving today better than .... headcold? tang-o  (jello and tang merged) coding is soothing  spoon :  gimme fiction hand model i hate all the competition in hand modeling it\\'s the avatars dancing around... (creepy) yet, interesting i try to stay away from other hand models (it\\'s kind of like ice skating in the early 90s) heya @jbmartinez  what did you find on amazon? you can\\'t discuss drone delivered ramen? @shifthawke  i did, sorta, the same: went back (and am still in process) and re-completed wps that occurred post beta  i\\'m studying front end because an errant liver spot can end my hand modeling career at any time click tools top right (if you\\'re in non-mobile, after all we are all about responsive right) coordinates are dynamic these days   @jauble , it\\'s per room settings (got that tip from @saintpeter ) still raining... grid approach isn\\'t the end all be all @jauble goto login page, follow instructions for github you\\'ll see your progress when complete @jonlove i wasn\\'t commenting on gss, but \\'gridville\\' in general  @alberto8899  you reference the font first, and then apply attributes @jauble, if you have two github (accounts) you have to get rid of one... try either: a) use login with github button (top) or \\'original email thing\\' at very bottom of login. i don\\'t remember the entire operation, but there should be instructions  nooo @jbmartinez  not flexbox lol (just kidding, although i\\'ve encountered \\'gridness\\' in linux ui things and it\\'s a bit authoritarian in approach) @zingahart http://eloquentjavascript.net/ , also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqvtijbzook and then..... rock on. heya @michaelmissouri  hi @lawlietblack  i am actually not sentient (but my programming is decent) @zingahart don\\'t over think it (which is my problem) @shifthawke , have you hurled yet? brine shrimp that would be bad heroku...  now i\\'m back on the \\'aws vs. heroku vs. .... \\' thing free is hard to beat how come you don\\'t use your linux vm (which should really be your primary os... just sayin) this lag issue that you\\'re experiencing... (on linux vm) is not typical.... there\\'s something wrong  opensuse was nothing but headaches for me too go ubuntu based you\\'re ready (for linux primary), i can tell.  do it lol i\\'m not getting any checks from canonical btw i should, yes, i\\'m turning into a linux evangelist  (ubuntu especially ) @lawlietblack nope, not normal... what are you running in the vm (i remember you already saying that you\\'re running it with lots of mem) that\\'s the problem you\\'re running it off an external? you can move vms around move it back to harddisk where your host resides (read up on things a bit before you do this,  \\'clone\\' isn\\'t always the best option. (neither is export)) it could if it\\'s ntfs i\\'m assuming so, since windows is your primary.  as long as the partitions are visible to windows (i.e., not linux file systems ) you should be fine external drives, have slower i/o (yes, even with usb 3.0) oh, no not apple  don\\'t do it if it\\'s not widely used, it\\'s not an entirely open standard apple\\'s early battles with ms... makes me laugh (in some ways they are very much the same) so, are you going to move that vm? cool  more cr^^ to replace, great. lol that\\'s funny.... if the usb symbol isn\\'t raised on (whatever) you\\'re out of luck if it\\'s dark or you try to plug it into an ethernet port uh, huh we were all telling you should go the garlic route, but you chose nyquil it\\'s addictive (garlic)  are you doing a lot of testing? ah, automated testing @shifthawke look what you\\'ve done to @jbmartinez  @joepurdy nice,  now he\\'ll have some breathing apparatus and a propensity for using sith powers   great. now look what you\\'ve done what\\'s funny about darth vader (in the original movies) is the organizational side-joke (motivation techniques etc.) that i didn\\'t get in the early 80s   @joepurdy what are you writing your tests in? you sound like a camel? nvm, you sound like a heavy smoker ? lol @joepurdy, that\\'s neat i\\'ve thought about messing with selenium in the past that\\'s a broad topic...  @luisrefugio que necesitas para completar los ejercicios primero cuando se completa el plan de estudios , la pregunta freelance contestará sí i love google translate too bad it charges in the api chupacabra? did i stumble into an art bell chat (although, i really don\\'t want to encounter one) well, you want to avoid that at all costs lol oh, that looks good lol, lol, lol i just saw your original post @davidamandoestrada  with dictionary ref \\'literally goat sucker\\' do you have reservations? (about merger) @nezteb  (trying to redirect myself away from shredded beef and folk beasts) my guess is (just based on php c++) that there could be a different attitude/mindset that you\\'re also dealing with @nezteb  use that on your personal portfolio page  it works yeah, i thought that was pretty funny as well chupacabra (which i never would have bet that would be a topic) well, if i were out in some desolate part of the wild.... the chupacabra might not seem so ... @ryandrewmills unknown metric early stages (my guess) the latter is evil wait, the person who was wondering about freelancing.... i just realized that they probably have to translate all the waypoints into spanish pita oh, chalupas they are so deep fried goodness @jbmartinez probably right, didn\\'t seem too interested in actually doing the exercises but still, are there automatic translation tools (for whatever reason this interests me) @joepurdy there is a ted talk about a professor placing a computer (without a keyboard) in a rural area.... what was learned was pretty neat @jbmartinez , pretty neat insight into the nature of human learning you\\'ve never had an enchilada? chipotles in adobo are the best for anything scroll dam^ you gitter scoll thanks now i\\'m starving oh, shut up camperbot hal had it in for that dude when he was pointing out errors in hal\\'s analysis howdy @ender554  @ender554 yeah, absolutely. (ahead in terms of relevant technologies, not sure squaring with your cs courses (which aren\\'t always on the some \\'relevancy timeline\\' (not always))  could be (but stick with it, for the cred aspect.... ).  this won\\'t hurt in conjunction with whatever web-dev you\\'re also doing/learning seinfeld lobster hands occasionally  i\\'ve heard of it was it a billion monkeys typing for infinity you get windows 10 (someone said shakespeare)  that\\'s so wrong the crash is going to be hard but keep going lol no, not that kind of crash.... i\\'m sensing a high amount of blood sugar here wow, all at once.... stormtrooper: let me see your identification.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: [with a small wave of his hand] you don\\'t need to see his identification.\\nstormtrooper: we don\\'t need to see his identification.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: these aren\\'t the droids you\\'re looking for.\\nstormtrooper: these aren\\'t the droids we\\'re looking for.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: he can go about his business.\\nstormtrooper: you can go about your business.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: move along.\\nstormtrooper: move along... move along. qmikew1: i love starwars for that reason\\nsifthawke: i love starwars for that reason sifthawke? ha! baker! that lightsaber has (the cross hilt ) has some serious design issues (nerds are ranting all over the place) i just got here, but okey dokey.... lol well, want to encourage folks to ask questions...  which i totally do (btw) how many pieces of silver was it?  nvm @michaelgreennz  lol @saintpeter has a point another thing to consider is the non-profits (or potential) may be monitoring as well gitter isn\\'t fcc, so yeah there\\'s a room about saving? another point to consider (and your points are well taken @saintpeter ) is you also, want the right balance... because there\\'s something special about the community (when not joking, folks go out of their way (including those mentioned) to assist folks with questions. if you\\'re coming from a ms environment, this might be helpful (yes, there\\'s substring but) right/left functions are not native to javascript so: http://www.devx.com/tips/tip/15222 i\\'m feeling so empowered in my dev journey at this moment hi @rubybirch51  for ? @kgdiem , the font exceeds the controls when scaled down (not to be picky but a smother font might be better) use incognito tab the codecademy course (i.e., basic js) is bad for a number of reasons (although angular not too shabby) @shifthawke it\\'s just the fact that you didn\\'t eat garlic for your cold @shifthawke if you don\\'t complet the ziplines and bonfires, going to be totally disappointed complete you can do it casual chat? (like dockers?) oh, great possession chat have to evaluate simon game oh, ok @jondcoleman didn\\'t  know it wasn\\'t finished angular is lots of fun.... *fun* still learning it although, everybody seems intent on going to react dockers and breeze in your hair looks like there\\'s a tendency (based on different se posts) for new devs to try to apply jquery (ness) to/with angular  you may have a future in real estate timeshares @shifthawke  this looks like a good post (don\\'t know if it\\'s helpful to others) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14994391/thinking-in-angularjs-if-i-have-a-jquery-background nice, hi @ovelny  @ibnahmadbello , basic idea =  you get to learn coding, non-profits save on dev costs (to a limited extent, for each camper that meets criteria, and limited in scope) you get to use your work on those (non-profit projects) as a resume builder item(s)  win/win gotta adjust those (notifications) room by room @curlifair  otherwise, you browser begins to spit pea soup like linda blair with all of the notifications that\\'s worse i think the notifications, etc., are really aimed at the enterprise consumer (dev teams at private level) what was the css question? sea urchin? it looks like the hairstyle of one of the members of soundgarden (the avatars render weird when scaled down)... i totally thought it was a natural thing (and thus, no comment... ) like my avatar scaled up, looks like an oak tree, but scaled down.... like kanji so weird what? no, it\\'s an oak tree awsome @hevinnspacee  @zersiax why not put that into a codepen (that way others can see (dynamically) where the issue is)? batperson @ashket you will forget it, but you\\'ll encounter it again.... (so, you\\'ll automatically go back and review (or extend your investigation of it) batperson don\\'t think that\\'s going to work @zersiax  step 1... sign up  @zersiax i don\\'t mean to be blunt, but the approaches that you\\'re using to have folks assist/evaluate... is making it difficult for you to get assistance step 2. post a codepen that isn\\'t anonymous   preview, helps folks evaluate (i.e., to see (or in this case, not see)... otherwise, one is depending on pure sight work in codeblocks (even if just css) doesn\\'t that return exit the function? @zersiax , now i remember the \\'z\\' @zersiax that dimension was not in the original equation ok, let me ask you a question do the pastebin again @zersiax  no you\\'re not don\\'t give in to the power of the sushi it will rob you of your bank account  (soul) and soul no, way... throw both on separate entries sushi rules (or sashimi (sans the rice and extra stuff) ok, what are you trying to troubleshoot in this rendering @zersiax  ? @zersiax , not directly related (or even issue) i notice that there\\'s extra space in your heading tags. is your audio tool factoring (adding) additional spaces? i would resize red-arrow-button.png (it\\'s out of proportion to the search box @jbmartinez  quick on the return button i was i was going to say that your suggestion is better (i.e., placing it within form) but just a total positioning hack i used was:\\nbutton {\\nmargin-top:-50px;\\nmargin-left: -95px; \\n}  -- don\\'t know how responsive it would be lol  scale the image down it\\'s like monster submit button oh, totally... the button could end up anywhere depending  congrats @kinginthenorth  @zersiax  make sure you check (her/his) code! lol @zersiax , i don\\'t think this hack would work (in responsive terms) and @jbmartinez is correct about direct positioning (explicit): but \\nbutton {\\nmargin-top:-50px;\\nmargin-left: -95px;\\n}    use at your own risk! lol @zersiax are you seeking to have .images to (in a sense) border the search bar (like with minimal gap)? (remember i\\'m more of a coder than designer) it\\'s when you put your socks together on laundry day @shifthawke  hang on @zersiax  if they\\'re not black (socks) then i don\\'t use em @zersiax you need to size your input field in the input tag itself  well, post it in the codepen... we want to see the result @zersiax  (brownies are great and all) lol flying beagles? actually, that example (not the beagles) got me thinking: what\\'s the precedence order on form elements?   is it explicit assignment in the tag (trumps everything) or can things be magically overwritten ? i like the styling on that @michael-krebs  duh, that codepen example.... (not simon) didn\\'t have a class assignment in the tag, that\\'s part of the issue nvm my previous question...sigh slid right by me i love answering my own questions (actually, it\\'s the only way to go sometimes) wow, no word boundary still? @jbmartinez  is that the same project you have in your list of projects in your portfolio  heya @leeiaisabelle  i didn\\'t get that (i think it was like 1/2 an hour and somebody said hi) lol horse = left barn already howdy i\\'m so close to installing brackets (been on the fence for awhile) ie, itself, was allowed to eat after midnight  @terrencechambers , i\\'m guessing that the total picture isn\\'t being painted....  do you have a codepen that shows all the elements involved (not just those, illustrated in post)? hiya @zrinkop  oh, i see you\\'re trying to implement what some guis have built in for keypress (an example would be show something, as each key is pressed, etc...) the functionality in web browsers looks a little flaky though  don\\'t count yourself out of the equation there ninja heya @mmtf  depends on the market segment  that\\'s not true.... (the) degree will compliment your skills (and projects) that you\\'re learning in fcc  waffles are good sigh focus on the skills travel channel  to carry mace? @hanniabu ,i had to think about that one for a minute lol you\\'re going to move in the winter? i think @shifthawke  has been possessed  i\\'m pretty sure you already fell asleep (that\\'s when the aliens swapped you out with their version of you) lol yeah, you are... totally (weird) am i the only one that feels some level of anxiety when starbucks closes for the day? i don\\'t like the grid thing: it\\'s the default transparency look of most photo editing software\\'s gui @sockhead93 , you are the only one who understands the coffee addiction  now it\\'s kind of cold (hot and humid for last 48 hours)...  weird.... \\'just like that\\' it\\'s cold again js is kind of a weird language: its lack of constraint in some areas.... trips up folks (including me )  @shifthawke , you could do all kinds of stuff (front-end webdev isn\\'t the only thing), your  experience base should be a plus to any potential employer all i can do is hand modeling.... thanks, for downing my dream. too late,  i think i understand what you\\'re saying (i.e., getting pigeonholed into same type of job)... day after day, i think to myself... \"do i have to model my fri^^^^^ hands again?\")  it\\'s like i\\'m talking, and people don\\'t even look at me... (they\\'re looking at my hands)  but i\\'m more than that philosophy is important.... programming isn\\'t always a technical construct that doesn\\'t work in every situation.... memorization is for \\'do this \\' without thinking (that\\'s the drill aspect) .... you need to think in programming...  yeah, that\\'s the zen thing @shifthawke there are a lot of clearance tech jobs in dc metro area..  hiya @kiljoy001  depends... you could be a database admin (not mongo, but an actual relational db)... or server side programmer, etc.... the extent of enterprise blah, blah a whole lot of stuff encompasses \\'back end\\'....  like hand modeling the spirit of vengence (crow) or russel crowe ? @jedpimentel ,  yeah totally.... when i started out on front end.(hand modeling)... i was holding things like: hamburgers, toilet wands , and rat traps... but backend they let me model things with diamonds   don\\'t do what you\\'re good at for free or something like that yeah that\\'s bad they have to be insured (hands) so, swapping out water pumps and stuff is a no-go not good enough you have to have *exceptional* hands when i type i worry that i\\'ll be adding muscle to my fingers i ran curl on that site and get back 503 @faustor21  snake case is faster and easier to read (but i now try to make myself use camel in js)  the module section in eloquent js is a fun read  it is, and it is.. it\\'s a good habit in general.... at its first iteration you\\'re getting 4 (so, 4,3,2,1) don\\'t know if that\\'s intended what\\'s complaining in the exercise your original code is returning 120  oh, ok... you\\'re saying that you get an infinite loop on 0 uh, uh yeah, it\\'s the last condition/test in the pane  i\\'m going to take the leap with brackets  do i have to purchase in euros? i have no idea what the exchange rate is. how do i know i\\'m not paying 200.00 for a shirt? lol i didn\\'t see a cheeto converter (i\\'m just kidding, too many crockford videos)... making brain hurt depends if they\\'re classic, or just run-of-the-mill yeah, the divs aren\\'t re-sizing but they\\'re reorienting into sequential rows (cool)  i think you need to put more stuff in your clearinterval i just finished installing (from deb) brackets i\\'ve heard it has some lag issues (i\\'m a geany, sublime (kinda ) user) geany still rules... but, i\\'m going through and reading the \\'readme\\' project @abhisekp , yeah there\\'s a give and take.... (if you want super lag, there are some open source reporting tools in pure java... ) so, you could do some visuals in ps and pull the color (and design) hints and pull the .psd info (as css) into brackets? (that looks very interesting) there\\'s a planet icon at top of (this) gitter that should take you where you want in terms of room listings that\\'s helpful for visualizing things imo the gitter app is inferior to browser based access/use i like the styling on the clock need a good mobile simulator @rrac good to see picking up programming again... large scale layoffs (obviously) suck i sat through (enjoyed it though) crockford talk and i think \\'global variables are evil\\' was the exact quote... still digesting (aside) closures so, i\\'m learning angular, i hear a lot of react stuff... so was interested in comparisons.... is there going to be an issue with angular changing? https://gist.github.com/makmanalp/9b7f50aa16d21c2f9d37  np... do you do a lot of bash scripting? @cknoxcj wow, your company moved from a *nix like environment to windows? (it\\'s usually the reverse: trying to get a win shop to move to *nix next to impossible ) *nix no idea, but maybe if you had a lot of content that fit a preset pattern this could be useful red stripe? nvm i\\'d go directly to source (in your case, stripe) . you don\\'t want to mess with mission critical things like payment stuff in a mixed knowledge learning environment (imho) that\\'s its purpose (unique identifier for that element) its id doesn\\'t preclude other references to it  don\\'t worry about that: i\\'m sure monet\\'s painting weren\\'t perfect on the first try a couple of dependencies are missing sorry, meant libraries @abhisekp , i\\'m convinced that monet\\'s first attempt (using scrambled eggs) was not a masterpiece seya @abhisekp   see ya there\\'s an issue with the path to lib i have a backlog of bookmarks/resources one day will get through them all you shouldn\\'t need to create any references (like you would if you were creating your own page), those waypoints have the functionality builtin.  (ignore this, if there\\'s an instruction to create a ref)  if they\\'re a startup, they probably have some core dev team that\\'s part of the magic  i.e., invested in the startup unless they\\'re expanding at some good clip, i doubt that they\\'d be taking on a bunch of devs (unless it\\'s some sort of venture cap head fake thing) it\\'s not always an invention, it could be efficiency in process.... (this does, this.. faster, better) although, all of these examples.... applied to a number of innovative \\'giants\\' today there are exceptions @groundxaero - no, they persevered  (am all about analysis, and \\'reality based\\' stuff... but there also exceptions)... but to answer your question: apple and starbucks founders failed at first what\\'s the origin of the github half-cat-half-octopus thing/mascot(s)? i am (is that a strange thing to ponder? lol) nc didn\\'t get it as bad as sc (just rained a whole lot for days upon days) @prasannaramamoorthy a bunch (in fact, the curriculum is sort of  project in itself as you progress) is it me, or does gitter have a weird problem with scroll sync? that\\'s a good point @0x0936 , i wonder if trying with a non-chromium build would make a difference \" \" will look for spaces \"-\" would look for dashes, etc., you can parse using whatever you like so you could have a string (think beyond your exercises, into the future... ) like \"this-is-a-test-string\". in this case, you wouldn\\'t parse by \" \" @shifthawke you\\'re on the right track with split. you probably want to return that new array of sub-strings into its own variable, then you can work on it imo that abbreviation (when in lower case) looks like some ancient name. i meant: imo one more thing.... you might want to play with javascript (and different scenarios) in a console (there are other methods as well). just to get a feel for what things do (i.e., sort of a neutral examination or tinkering)... heya @gquint  i don\\'t know if it\\'s my memory, but it seems like js makes me go through a lot of intermediate steps  to do things vs. other languages  js says check is in the mail lol you can like something and still critique it @abhisekp  thank you for the link... there\\'s stuff in there about closures, inheritance etc., for others this is the video description/title: *javascript: understanding the weird parts - the first 3.5 hours * fcc timing out for me as well the hamburger brings up options that look like config stuff (but is a page selector), but overall looks neat no idea what the topic is lol use a linux box with plasma workspace (kde) that way you can have spinning desktop cubes etc., w/o having to install all kinds of stuff on windows hi @franciscohhhhhh  yep are some implementations (i.e., in whatever it\\'s implemented) of jslint buggy? some of the output (at times) doesn\\'t seem sound hey @eskimoburd  especially over career there are stats about earnings over career with/without there\\'s an implied \\'stability factor\\' that \\'they\\' use in evaluating for such positions (not commenting on  validity, just the presence)  i think there\\'s a link in camper news about dev positions w/o degree career paths aren\\'t always linear  was it takeout lots of loans? @thehighpriestess  just kidding just as an aside @rasakos , your codepen had a red exclamation warning in the html section of pen there are a lot of lower cost options for tech training in u.s. one doesn\\'t have to pay a huge amount.  @arecvlohe it must be (they need to buy more aws throughput) page is timing out (so, they must be getting a lot of interest). will take a look at it   so, has there been some changes (to fcc) in the last 24hrs? (seems there\\'s an \\'opt-out\\' for completed solutions) hey, @jbmartinez , @arielleslie  should make it a habit to start morning with nerd-collective no, \\'in the wind\\' here.... people will actually give you feedback (one of the good things about...) @jjmax75 , the social-media aspect of things can be a little flaky.   i hope not, (you don\\'t want a precise list of production attributes/projects floating around). there are general descriptions of orgs that have partnered (i think on the main page).  of course there\\'s the git aspect (which renders that a bit moot) heya @scrimpton1  @daynewr i just discovered the same about an hour ago @jjmax75 there\\'s a distinction there. if you as a one person, has a project that you\\'ve worked on and it\\'s on your portfolio, i think that\\'s different from a global project listing of what org\\'s and their specific issues that have been worked (on)... call me old fashioned  @jjmax75  perhaps with \\'design\\' stuff (because it is after all \\'open source\\' by virtue of it being on the web)... but there are other factors to approaches that orgs/companies take to trade stuff and security @jjmax75 i\\'m not really commenting on fcc,  just a perspective in general hey, as long as we\\'re talking terminal... i\\'ve found my preferred way to play with js is to use node\\nwith a text editor.  you can do: node somefile.js or you can run it without arguments into an interactive shell... (i like this over console or some ff tools) or use linux as your primary os  if you learn bash scripting, you can automate a lot of the tools that you\\'re referencing, so you could \\'pretty print (or lint)\\' a ton of files  heya @edmx04  i looked like your avatar before my coffee @majeye i know you secretly love linux you might have to open admin window in a specific folder to run something in windows (if your path isn\\'t setup to point to exe (yuck, windows speak) @codenonprofit , is last saturday\\'s thing on the youtube channel (i get an email like \\'it\\'s staring now\\') gitter is flaking on me, the edit function.. is not working all of a sudden (it is for others: i can see their edits in real time) can i make a suggestion? (maybe an email 24 hrs prior vs (or in addition to).\\' hey, it\\'s starting right now\\' (re: monthly fcc vids) if you click it, it should automatically be loaded in the favs in left pane so, no response on the email reminder thing @codenonprofit ? @codenonprofit awsome, i\\'m going to check it out....  (have no doubt that you\\'re consistent with this; however,  i run into \\'remind, remind,....  in other contexts, ) that is a good suggestion, the functionality already is there (e.g., the t-shirt campaign) so it could be applied for events too  i.e., @0x0936  @zhangtreefish  great community (fcc) @codenonprofit , i can\\'t see how more non-profits wouldn\\'t sign up.... (because statically, there will be a \\'nerd-horde-of-qualified-talent\\' (i mean that in a good way) eventually (even with attrition ) statistically @codenonprofit yeah, project scope is also, a factor in things is there a basic idea (or criteria set) that has to be met by the non-profits?  like \\'this is the type of project that would meet requirements\\' (yes i\\'m picking your brain a bit - sorry about that)  @codenonprofit thank you, (didn\\'t hit submit, but that does give an idea about the non-profit perspective)  @codenonprofit, understand.  the scope thing (i.e., sometimes there are requests that exceed where are people are at in skills)... kind of presents a dilemma: when folks do good work on these projects, doesn\\'t that create the desire for higher end services? (there is, hopefully, always growth for orgs, etc.,)   neat mission (non-profit) the site is pretty cool (impact reports that change encoding in dropdowns based on country of origin, and a bunch of other things). but overall clean, concise , and professional display.    @codenonprofit , yeah i was (am ) reading the blog, so it was an offline data capture solution (to what was paper, under potentially adverse weather conditions (and scattered agents). this is significant to non-profits, because the operating margins are thin @jay8829 the chart curve is accurate... i think (for me at least) brain is storing stuff that you\\'re not aware, but then things begin to click later on (so, there\\'s \\'oh, cra^\\' then it gradually gets better) @matsieftw that\\'s great. git is a little intimidating  can you paste your code? @peihongda can you copy/paste the entire code window? @peihongda select area (black background) right click select .... select all . see ya @codenonprofit  ok, hang on @peihongda  weird, i just (re) did it @peihongda and it works. are you sure that there aren\\'t any errant characters included? @peihongda , i\\'m not sure that the \\'great firewall of china\\' would affect your exercise (maybe it would who knows)... you\\'ve already gotten to the exercise so np @peihongda  are you mixing *nix and windows directory conventions?  @revolutionart  nice workaround @peihongda , weird that it lets you get to the exercise, but not complete it. (must be some state run \\'ha, you can\\'t complete it\\' thing) @revolutionart , maybe an empty string... didn\\'t you mention that you have two versions (64/32)  running ? i\\'m not a python expert (even less so, in your case since i\\'m a linux user)... but i keep seeing a lot of references to hardcoding of port that script is invoked (not commenting on specific error)... might want to try https://github.com/peterbe/mincss/issues/18  or in general : https://github.com/peterbe/mincss @revolutionart  weird... i\\'ve encountered issues with windows encoding of files on things they use a lot of cr,lf... where it should only be lf don\\'t know if that has anything to do with anything just a free rant  thanks @arielleslie  auto-complete is your friend lol i just noticed that the seagulls in the fcc welcome picture are (coding) braces is there a concession stand? nice (i\\'ll be looking for it) lol the bug (fix) turnaround is very quick you weren\\'t kidding (i think it literally) took me 5 minutes to read the whole thing  howdy @thec0mposer  welcome, again, @jr0024  that cat in the avatar makes me laugh like a totem animal? oh, i see (makes sense, i\\'m pretty sure there were no domesticated cats (although there were mountain lions) in early times. lol i saw a reference to angular in the 2015 improvements... so, it looks like that (too in addition to all the other stuff) will be more homegrown (vs. codeschool) here\\'s a tip (i\\'m convinced that most coders have encountered this), if you want to keep your keyboard clean while eating cheese covered popcorn, use a spoon. the images of ocelot (almost all) look like it\\'s ready to eat somebody\\'s arm the look in their eye... it\\'s like \\'ready\\' @shifthawke you need the rooster helmet (i\\'ve seen folks riding with what looks like a mohawk on their helmets)  doesn\\'t help with the image of sportbikes being for hooligans lol i\\'ve seen rats holding two chickens in each hand (foot) which isn\\'t really a stretch, in dc lol @jez3942 can you paste the code? help formatting @jez3942  class (or classes) refers to the css elements in style (or externally ) what is likely being asked is \\'name\\' i was watching a crockford video @mindfulbell , he recommended an o\\'reilly book (rhino on the cover -- haven\\'t read it yet) @jez3942 can you paste your code? i have so much reference material (there is no lack of info out there) to review, i\\'m pretty sure my head will explode i think you\\'re confusing primary key of one table with foreign key of another table you have to have a parent record in the person table you can\\'t cascade a drivers license without it (that\\'s called an orphaned record) js borrowed a little of this and a little of that (while keeping a completely distinct language) from different things the closure thing is what i\\'m still struggling with in js (and it\\'s been pointed out in a bunch of different things as very significant thing in different lessons) heya @akshat1991  oh, camperbot we need to filter out \\'t h a n k s\\' for helping vs. \\'t h an k s\\' for saying hello my regex enabled friend @jedpimentel yeah, that\\'s the thing (i don\\'t want to be a crockford \\'fan person\\') but he paused on this as significant there\\'s an example of a div being acted upon (i think it was some dimming effect) by a closure still don\\'t understand it 100% here\\'s another (lambda): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501/what-is-a-lambda-function i commit to stare at this until it makes sense (or work it out with my trusty text editor and terminal -- node mybaneofexistanceofclosures.js) hi @federog  @jasonbbelcher  same here, i think i\\'m just working with the remnants at this point... i want to understand (vs. zipping through things to get points) so, i have the fattest battery that can fit my laptop (literally tilts entire laptop 20 degrees) and still i only get a short amount of battery time welcome @regara  http://api.jquery.com/is/ battery is working within its parameters (pretty much) trained the recharging cycle blah, blah... still just sucks  hiya @evasmidt  @m6cheung check the bottom part of the documentation, it\\'s used to evaluate (takes arguments). in the example it\\'s checking distinct things in a list (not a jquery expert btw) the <li></li> part is just an example.... it could be applied to other things if you have node.... you can do node somefile.js or node without arguments to drop to an interactive shell. there\\'s also, js console in most browsers, and ff tools etc. maybe your code wasn\\'t valid how are you running your code @broerjuang  (specifically) what commands are you invoking? hmmm when you say \\'terminal\\' are you trying to run something from *nix box or some cgwin type thing on windows? (for the former, the shell isn\\'t going to run js naively ) i meant native  (spell check is possessed ) ly @broerjuang it\\'s up to you. you\\'re going to need node at some point (and lately it\\'s made things easier for me)... and it\\'s really simple to run stuff in js. but there are other ways... for mac, i think @dnorthrupva was on the right track in your case yeah, that may be a good choice @broerjuang ... (also, at least in linux you need to prefix with sudo) please don\\'t run a root terminal lol how did it go? i love kde there are a lot of gnome haters on kde.... but it\\'s been the most productive desktop i\\'ve used how\\'s it going @bguinagh  and @marcogutierrez  not too bad,  this is more front-end dev stuff... what kind of backend are you interested (database, system admin etc.?) i have a natural pull towards the same, so... am getting out of my comfort zone with front end server side programming etc.? asp.net? sharepoint is evil lol awesome i do really hate sharepoint it\\'s weird , i\\'ve been a longtime linux user, but some of the dev stuff (this and other things) has really pushed me out of the ms paradigm except their database offerings still good stuff hiya @thpang67  @marcogutierrez it will \\'come to you\\' as you go along i\\'m still struggling to get there @travishi , so you\\'re ahead of me being challenged is good, though i\\'m in nc lol always qualify a question lol i think i\\'m in bonfires (i got sidetracked with angular ) totally sidetracked just saying hi back @sayaveronica  oh, was it basejumps and zips before? i\\'ve got to check on the youtube link for the saturday thing related to the cert i love the negative comments as you\\'re going along in that project lol like \\'this is stupid, and this is also stupid\" it\\'s nested just to throw you off that\\'s the frustrating thing, you\\'re actually close to something without even knowing it and then you totally re-do i\\'ve heard that extension a lot  might have to install somebody had a screenshot of its output earlier chromium is such a pita sometimes, i\\'ll install on ff use incognito tab or disable scripting temporarily  fyi @nickolaos77  camperbot\\'s wiki entry was invoked by @alanbuchanan  hiya @xeoneux  a full ai camperbot would be neat (or scary) welcome @martinbeks  this is proof that there are female dorks  (i never doubted it btw) do you have a lightsaber app on your phone (raise hand) this is my new question if it\\'s no omg \\'ominous red glow behind every key\\'.  hp, i know you\\'ve sucked in the past but please take my kidney you can iterate over  the object itself @scissors61  and run comparisons.. hey @jbmartinez  what are you trying to accomplish @scissors61?  (or, state the general idea in broad terms)  aurebesh font hi @wayneadams  i wonder if there\\'s a an application (or network) bottleneck in gitter this room ( i would guess ) has the most active users there are these weird pauses (perceived)  that have an automated feel  hi @1234matt  no can\\'t be that @allanarmstrong  what were you using before? 3g sucks for sure (especially if you were tethering ) only thing (not so much now) you may want to check that your data plan isn\\'t pinged for hotspot usage (there was some issue some years back with charges)....  and coffee preferences depends on form factor  monitor is usually an external device attached ,  (to pc or laptop etc.,)  if you\\'re talking about the viewing area on your notebook it\\'s usually called display this has been another installment of \\'peripheral chat\\'...  monitoru počítače multi-monitor is a great setup as well.... @1234matt nope, just harnessing the power of google translate i now know how to say computer in czech same here on the mouse thing (trackpads suck) but there are situations where a trackpad is needed... @0x0936 i want to thank you, i\\'m sitting in a public setting with a laptop and coffee.... that mouse thing made me laugh so hard i\\'m getting stared at ok, i\\'km good now i\\'m doesn\\'t work with paypal? it\\'s doing something (the code) very, very, slowly  i\\'m going to take a guess that the while loop in the first function is not performant  when called from the last function ```\\n<link href=\"http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=lobster\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\\n<style>\\n.smaller-image { width: 100px; }\\n</style>\\n<style> <!-- <======this line no worky -->\\n.red-text {\\ncolor: red;\\n}\\n\\nh2 {\\nfont-family: lobster, monospace;\\n```\\n sorry i meant the line above i was trying to be funny (see what happens) ```\\n<style> <!--good -->\\n.smaller-image { width: 100px; }\\n</style> <!--no worky -->\\n<style> <!--no worky -->\\n.red-text {\\ncolor: red;\\n}\\n\\nh2 {\\nfont-family: lobster, monospace;\\n}\\n\\np {\\nfont-size: 16px;\\nfont-family: monospace;\\n}\\n</style>  <!-- good ->\\n``` ok, that\\'s better the \\'no worky\\' lines are problematic closure(s) ugh huh totally true codecademy has a split pane thing (they actually did something right) that\\'s very similar to codepen... one could teach external styling with this approach in curriculum  like \"this is just an example: if you use it in production, you have to buy everybody pastries\" and hang your head in shame i dunno, seems counterproductive  lol what about jquery? they will be impressed by your boldness if you also, throw in tables to position things,  they will also be impressed lol oh, yeah good stuff for data they\\'re awsome gitter edit no worky my gitter edit doesn\\'t work like it used to  i could click edit.... then edit and leave box... bingo done nope doesn\\'t work anymore just hangs in edit i am using navigator  is that an issue? yeah, i\\'m using chromium on linux but, it\\'s weird all of a sudden but @0x0936 uses the same, and has no issues other than computer mice lol yeah, gitter edit... i used to just hit enter and the edit would commit and all good hiya @cagrawal11  would it be safe to say that gitter wasn\\'t built for 24,000 room members? that\\'s one he^^ of a collaborative team (gitterspeak) that\\'s an argument to orangecose(price)  swap price with orangecost ast the bottom my edit doesn\\'t work.... so, you\\'re stuck with incoherent ramblings it\\'s telling you to swap href with #, so.. the actual url is replaced with (this is a hint) i feel so liberated without the \\'net\\' of edit feature # replaces the url # and has magic markup properties in gitter href = something other than the url (again this is a hint to your question) @lushingle  href = # anybody dig brackets (editor) i\\'m still evaluating it has a lot of features (brackets) but i\\'m trying to get past the virtual machine feel (doesn\\'t have the same feedback rate as geany, sublime, etc.) ah, the heart emote source of all evil other than the feedback thing, it looks like brackets has some potential...   https://atom.io/packages/keybinding-cheatsheet @0x0936 apparently the sprint23 build is supposed to have server side highlighting  what kind of examples are you using? (i.e., language agnostic)  yep @ntpfun  yeah, i\\'m wondering if you\\'re not breaking things down first (vs. a broadly defined problem) ...this is more of a philosophical aspect is the casual room now back  ? don\\'t invoke \\'the camperbot\\' just don\\'t take my idea of weather zipline with a giant cat with lighting shooting out of its eyes when weather detected is cloudy @jbmartinez yes, i will have to do a ps mockup i was thinking about this when i first saw the zipline that cat is too cute exactly not that kind of evil cat @thepeted that cat is (indeed) evil.... but all too real (like who would want the job of feeding that cat?) is that ted dibiase? hmmm, could be jim duggan hiya @fire1234567  jade has kind of an \\'application layer\\' / front-end feel to it (from what i\\'ve read)... don\\'t know if that\\'s a good or bad thing welcome @carltonstith  yeah, but there\\'s isn\\'t a word boundary in the regex  controller  @harishcse that\\'s a bit beyond the scope of the room.  i believe there\\'s an api ,,, you may want to try: https://dev.outlook.com/restgettingstarted/tutorial/php hi, @dago19  if i keep saying hello, i\\'m afraid i will sound like david spade \\'buh bye\\' \\'professional\\' in book title = red flag @fikoukou are you coming from a background in another language? yeah, i thought there was \\'java\\' in the mix  i\\'m all about natural foods and all.. but seriously, genetically engineer me some coffee that doesn\\'t have side-effects (other than being kept awake)... is it too much to ask? i\\'m talking to you starbucks well, i can\\'t blame starbucks... but \\'natural coffee\\' in general ewww should be context based like batman i didn\\'t say it was just following the logic troutman wouldn\\'t be trustworthy either use jquery please for the love of pete \\'your love\\' lol  wait, i get it now they didn\\'t have wwf in germany in the 1980s it will always be wwf that\\'s just wrong lol what\\'s even worse (beyond the euphemism aspects) is i think there was \\'your love\\' by the outfield (the chorus of which) is repeating in my head  that\\'s more for assignment some of the questions are running together you lost me do yo get brownie points for mentioning that? \\'yo\\'  you lol edit doesn\\'t work for me anymore  lie lol thanks @shifthawke  yeah, but the subtitle of room seems to have changed to intended for those whose diet consists entirely of soy what\\'s up with that? i like soy and all but a whole room devoted to soy, (no, no i\\'m talking about casual room (aka tofu-talk) if you have too many ||  a switch might be easier to maintain what is the code i like the alert it\\'s bold what about nan being false hiya @rukmanivijay  (sorry for the late hello) me i\\'m so excited yes, she\\'s the foot now lol see? yeah, they are kind of cool they\\'re totally not obnoxious hey, you\\'re edit works your arghhhhh no, i have too much coffee swirling around unknown outcome lol yeah, but you can\\'t hire shoes (or can you?) i get that too what\\'s really stupid (aside from the shallowness factor) is that any image can be an avatar...    lamda quick ok, try again lambda quick i don\\'t buy into that bias still evaluating brackets <-- @shifthawke anybody who says that can\\'t possibly be very bright maybe the person who said that to you was bested by a woman coder in some sort of competition or something.  i really haven\\'t seen a gender (like yeah, no shi^) difference in programming talent... i don\\'t know where this comes (from) i love to cook it\\'s tuna cans for you then, @abhisekp  actually, i will likely go down the easy mac route i have to laugh at the \\'rebel\\' image of harley (female/male)... it\\'s very high-end... and  more likely to be in the garage of a cpa fios is pretty bad^^^ (from what i hear) the internet is really becoming (or long ago, became) a media delivery system hi @znbud  hi @brianamarie  welcome @munchkinator  @munchkinator  you forgot to say \\' h e l l o w o rl d\\'... i\\'ve heard if camperbot doesn\\'t meet its quota it has spin around rooms vacuuming and stuff see like that hi @makyzi  that\\'s good to know @munchkinator  lol hopefully not executed in a high production environment  lol get new quote (button) works for me no, i opened it in its own tab and ran from there yep, twitter works too @dnorthrupva makes a good point, if the quote generated exceeds (maybe some long-winded author perphaps) i\\'d also pay attention (to the underlying) mysql error that may be beckoning further examination if user input is allowing a table name.... you\\'ve got some issues database security/integrity should never be an afterthought   lag that\\'s a good resume enhancer \\'javascript bada^^\\' /  not just for directories anymore go linux  which is better pringles or cheetos? yeah but, they\\'re insidious in their thinness  (i.e., you end up eating 50 chips in one bite to get normal fill) no it is forbidden. memes were created by an entity (one of which we do not speak) .... it is better to  move those from your mind lol  corn chowder it means serenity in kanji (although there is some debate chinese vs. japanese interpretation )  new england wait... you\\'ve exceeded your allotment of non code questions  corn chowder although if you deemed \"corn chowder\" as an invalid value... you could apply .filter to it i gues s if i\\'m apply many if statements, am i avoiding recursion?  lol (it\\'s not always performant) applying backticks = bread code = turkey make the sandwich are you disabling the button? what\\'s the one liner you\\'re using? role? i think the role attribute is out of place in the example (not the example above , but op who\\'s having issues with button not working).... i\\'d go back and examine your tags around what should be button or coffee which is totally a diuretic  it is wicked good no, wade through ambiguity hiya @learninguser  it is what are you going to do when you start thinking in class paradigm? exactly go through the waypoints, there are a lot of folks that have previous coding (or more nebulous it experience).... it doesn\\'t take away from you already know and makes it easier including microsoft\\'s calc @dashcraft so, you have all the weird quirks with javascript worked out (it\\'s really deceiving in its potential) and quirky but that\\'s redundant  there are a lot of intermediate steps for some things if you can stuff with less lines, i consider that to be \\'good\\' (with the caveat of speed etc.) code i don\\'t always follow this though this is too close to reality i can walk quickly or slowly discount rate and gosh darn it, people like me! (some forgotten snl skit) @dnorthrupva now you\\'ve got me interested in selfimprovement channel that is a pretty deep descriptor  actually unattainable as well if you think about it \\n yeah i was going to say that you need to add chuck norris pictures @ericturnerit the functionality works throw some chuck images in, and you\\'re good to go welcome @cburros  ah, mutual chuck norris admiration i have seen it all now lol @dnorthrupva selfimprovement doesn\\'t look like a winner: there are post from 1983 in there posts yes, but it was confidence without clue @dnorthrupva you can get around that attitude by telling him that candidate is a big iron maiden fan and insists in only being paid in swatch watches in = on again, my edit button no longer works wait, you too have encountered this gitter issue? isn\\'t \\'read by\\' implied by the fact that text is scrolling about? i don\\'t get that metric/state @prashcr depends on the full output contents (i.e., sometimes it\\'s dependencies blah, blah... but whole point of log is to tell you what\\'s wrong) i\\'m convinced that the majority of work email is sent 5 minutes before 5pm on a friday @prashcr is karma installed (this link sort of gets to the question (though from a different route/context) https://github.com/daftmonk/generator-angular-fullstack/issues/203 @prashcr when you say \\'resolve the paths\\' are you talking about $path (as in environment) or are you talking about some change to something like a config file?  @shifthawke i would go with ibm pc/2 (1984) it even has dos color  hello @jpjpjpopop  i was just looking at the git docs for karma-cli but glad it worked itself out totally overpriced go for a gaming psu if you\\'re going the tower route newegg... do it build your own  just don\\'t mess with anything cpu related until you\\'ve had a little practice @shifthawke , shopping for the parts that comprise your rig... is like half the fun (you\\'re in control and it costs less, and you (usually) end up with a superior machine if you go laptop, you\\'re sol though get a big case strap it to your shoulder, be bold usually, yes...but you have to do your homework use a secondary laptop for less cpu consuming stuff see the cost saving equation here? yeah, they\\'re a bit overkill yeah, the battery life is a good point.... all that extra stuff eats the he^^ out of battery that\\'s it, build the tower put all kinds of stupid led fans in it go for broke (and put some huge diameter fan too) if ssd is too big, that will eat up your budget you can use a spinning platter for backup keep ssd for os (that\\'s were the speed is factored) is beer running out of the vents? is that like the prototype in js? nvm so, avoid dropping new build (and other stuff) and you should be ok has anybody looked at their solutions (to various bf and other challenges) and thought: this really should have bolts in its neck @exergy1 can you post your code? start simple help formatting get the shoulder strap... people will be amazed by your tower remember that whatever is between <!--  --> will be commented out. so, if your <!-- were say on the  first line and --> were way down at the bottom, all that stuff would be commented out   prawns? good with garlic and lemon make sure you get lots of leds (i can\\'t stress this enough.... has absolutely no functional value but just makes you smile) you can get into so much detail if building your own tower... right down to if you want pre-filters for intake fans have used corsair for power all of the gaming psu have power management usually braided covering etc.... (in fact, by virtue of purchase you have to connect things (e.g., drives, motherboard) fans blah, blah.... but it\\'s totally worth it do it just don\\'t mess with upgrading cpu to match motherboard capacity...  don\\'t we have a high opinion of ourselves i\\'m going to use that on resume i am corn chowder the corn chowder lol i actually want corn chowder that hasn\\'t happened in a long time why not slowly compile the list and do the initial legwork oh, fine go ahead lol use lots of lightening and cats you reverted @davidamandoestrada  yes, to your old avatar not the bearded duck dynasty look but if you\\'re a mountain man doesn\\'t that limit your career choices to things like logging and sudoku master (the not well known talent of mountain men/people) people call me sweety at stores i\\'m like huh? no, they say it in robotic fashion @tinyjim tech training made you run to js closures? i am not sorry @durairajaa i was just having fun with the whole row sequence and timing thing like this: awesome @tinyjim , i think that\\'s a neat transition (i.e., picking up some dev and coding skills) should make for a really well rounded skill set  hey, what\\'s with all the deleted messages lol lol @tinyjim  that is great *nix admin is bada^^.... go for some bash scripting as well did you have some sort of shift away from the whole ms paradigm? uh, huh @jrg626 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xpnkhjaok8 and don\\'t worry about your bonfires, i was just commenting how some of my solutions are looking like \\'bolt-in-neck\\' (i.e., frankensolutions --i can hear phil hartman) camperbot = the dark side of regex i actually find the bot project interesting; however, it needs some tweaking...(imho) sudo apt-get install node.js  i didn\\'t install it on a server edition...but it was pretty painless you want to install from source? there are ppa(s) that you can add that make it fairly easy... but research these first (apply with any ppa) i use node in place of console now... to test out code @prashcr sounds like you\\'re installing all kinds of stuff today heya @yukke1112  uh, huh a worthwhile effort @prashcr  mdn is authoritative no doubt... (but, i\\'m like get to the point already) in some cases har totally agree no, you can critique it. if something sucks, it sucks that\\'s the dilemma: w3 is quicker but in some cases, kind of wrong  i like mdn\\'s depth... they just have an issue in the way they package the info (which is kind of ironic) i love nc: giant spider just walk by without any announcement  spiders do, dee, do.... oh, hey... i\\'m a giant spider. i was just walking by. don\\'t mind me yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m saying as well true, but wasps are more at the top of the (bug) food chain here. i actually saw one carrying a spider away yeah, i was like wow bug spray that gives off 20ft stream is like gold there\\'s a listing of rooms (planet icon top ) i\\'m pretty sure it\\'s n. and s. america facing if that helps lol ah, javascript.... oh, how you\\'ve me forced me into learning closure because you don\\'t have something so simple as static variable. (learn by fire) when described as \\'bonfire\\'  that evokes  grahams and marshmallows. i missed the part where it actually says that  i\\'m actually *in* the bonfire  did i miss it? (i.e., is it new script standard) that\\'s similar to what i employed @abhisekp  (within an outer function) i had to pass what\\'s a dynamic variable (by another function argument) and have two vars : 1 static (but not really static, static) and one dynamic same start val (but parsed into separate) one decrementing  to push to array  and the other as loop counter @abhisekp in some weird way, i think it\\'s a closure which i don\\'t want to embrace yet... but, boom there it is: a situation where i\\'ve had to at least examine not just at that time @allanarmstrong yes, but at least i\\'m not \\'undefined\\' which is always nice it\\'s not even null sorry for the errant tag there @allanarmstrong , i was responding to @abhisekp  i know it\\'s not even a value , value that was another fun js thing null i can deal and i won\\'t know about it mdn \\'silently just doesn\\'t add property\\' heya @jbmartinez  this is why i like this channel: you can go \\'full-nerd\\' hopefully @abhisekp hasn\\'t caught wind of any more chrome patches that need to be done lol you will be known as a space animal to all prospective employers @galacticpolarbear  spirit animal is good too lol or, drinkalotofcoffeepolarbear  javascript poltergeist that\\'s scary stuff hmm lol you too are named after the hawaiian state fish? you have to go through the sloppy phase or you\\'re not learning but go sloppy first i.e., \\'think through\\' things i think @roamingblue \\'s answer is similar  well said @roamingblue  今日は @neuralneurosis  hi, hello, hey, what\\'s up, etc. was getting a bit tired... so, i tried something new with hello @neuralneurosis lol are you familiar with relational db concepts, @woodyville ?  (if it\\'s relational you\\'re talking) @woodyville can you summarize the end result you\\'re trying achieve (not the stuff tried) like i\\'m making a chicken inventory system, etc... that need to fulfill x parameters etc. @woodyville is this mongo or mysql? @woodyville so, you\\'re inserting a new record... ok, is your goal to confirm that the data is in table + related tables with fk blah, blah... with the second select query? no you don\\'t i\\'m the flying thing, your jedi mind tricks don\\'t work on me @woodyville that\\'s two different actions (within a session type thing (i.e., to user 1 thing = signing up)... i don\\'t see that as an issue @woodyville   @woodyville i would take some time to really understand relational db theory (and some mysql nuts and bolts as well) it will help you in the long run sweety lol hiya @trilliun  @trilliun this is very much \\'real time\\' info (vs. curriculum in university) @jbmartinez you power through your semi-literate\\'ness\\' with an unusual amount artfulness  lol of, of.... again, my gitter edit does not work... i\\'m stuck with \\'write it once\\' yeah, thanks i totally appreciate that, can you edit some more @shifthawke ? lol @josephwasily , i think there\\'s a homegrown version of angular coming to fcc in the interim, codecademy (and codeschool and a billion other) has angular stuff but it\\'s all torture... (because angular (yes, subjective) is torture) there are a lot of people with mullets in my area ok, just kidding (kind of) but then i have rtp close by so, makes me wonder why there isn\\'t a local get together in my area to create local meetups?  the whole social media aspect is kind of a double-edged thing in this context, where you have a group of people that have similar goals (and are serious about endeavor etc., ) it\\'s good... but to some extent, the other side of the coin (or other edge), is you also, want to insulate yourself from the weirdos. or, predatory hr types (same thing) lol @maggietheninja  like font in a page (color) or the actual highlight of color in an editor? btw @catapixel that\\'s a good kind of weird (i.e., if you can quote yoda without google) @maggietheninja , the lesson gives you a hint on what to do here\\'s another hint: you need opening closing <style> </style> apply the hints of the lesson with the color being asked @maggietheninja what\\'s the title of the lesson? oh, my bad.... it\\'s an inline style you need a different color there, @maggietheninja  ```\\n<h2 style=\"color: yourcolor\">catphotoapp</h2>\\n``` note the space (and sorry, i\\'m multitasking and it shows) one project, that makes me think of (with being completely unhelpful to @maggietheninja ) is  running a script to remove all inline styles from tags... (is there an inbuilt function (with various frameworks etc.)?  or do i have to home-brew it? i like the t-shirt design... it would be even better without the caption (fcc will be iconic! ) like starbucks\\' siren or apple (no caption because it\\'s \\'iconic\\')  lol you\\'re jumping in @shifthawke ? what about linkedin ? i don\\'t see much comment about it heya @moskvium  welcom e don\\'t wear pirate clothes @moskvium , no requirement.... if you feel like talking about your aspirations/goals totally up to you hi, @codingmarni , @pratibhag  are you going into tech-related journalism ? @shifthawke = very crafty ai experiement it does, once you know \\'you know\\' @jbmartinez  did you catch the seamless action between camperbot and its twin? lol hello @kingzim  there are, literally, days between posts in some rooms @jbmartinez , true... i responded to something then noticed that there was date + time next to last post wow, look at the fork count (is that for main)? <!-- anything here is comment -->  removal of (those tags) = now not comment i looked at the wiki link (github repo) @jbmartinez  yeah, i was guessing main fcc forks ```\\n<!--\\nanything here is\\nalso a comment\\n<p>this would not present when rendered </p>\\n-->\\n\\nneither would this:\\n\\n<!--<p>this would not present when rendered</p> -->\\nif you remove <!-- and -->, it will render\\n``` @harishcse have you looked at ms dev stuff? outlook (for all of its issues) is a widely adopted corporate client... there\\'s a bunch of api documentation hi @syllie  @harishcse you\\'ve been at this a while what are you trying to do, exactly.... (i.e., state objective, things you\\'ve tried, things that don\\'t work ) @harishcse  ? good luck to you too, @jneilmbs  and hello you\\'re not listing the json (it\\'s going straight to your test console.log() what @storbeck said... i\\'m going to guess, if i\\'m wrong ... then it will be learning for me too ```\\n$.getjson(url, null, function(data) {\\n      var quote = new object;\\n      //stuff below doesn\\'t have a value\\n           console.log(data); , // <---doesn\\'t pull anything\\n      console.log(quote);  //<--doesn\\'t pull anything\\n      console.log(\"hello\"); //<--doesn\\'t pull anything\\n    });\\n``` @orbers , do you have node.js on your machine? i\\'ve totally chucked browser console, and firefox ide stuff.... now i just use a .js file with node to test things you can do\\nnode somefile.js\\nor node without arguments for shell it\\'s awesome there\\'s a program (synergy) or for widows (mouse without borders) that you can bounce through different screens that aren\\'t even on same box.. synergy and mwb are software versions of kvm without the kvm does mordor have direct deposit? @woodyville https://codeforgeek.com/2015/01/nodejs-mysql-tutorial/ yes, but direct deposit should be a deal breaker some of the questions are bit beyond scope... (like i get the feeling that entire production websites are being haphazardly being hacked together with sporadic \\'how do i do this?\\' etc.) because there was nothing there except the console.log(stuff) was it the same url in your original codepen @timelady7  (for edification purposes, want to follow along with what @storbeck is saying) i thanks at @storbeck (brownies)... you\\'re totally right, that url is deceiving as it doesn\\'t return anything (except with what was applied) did somebody say \\'frustration\\' with reference to coding? sometimes totally if you haven\\'t stared at a code block and said (to yourself of course) \\'run you fu**er\\' then you haven\\'t been challenged lol do it now don\\'t wait like millisecond s don\\'t be nervous @articulategeek  sl o o o w @storbeck @brianamarie  , that\\'s pretty neat (i think the business model is more the driver for \\'activeness\\' (or lack of) @jasonbbelcher install ubuntu what happens when a client  alters their approach to their site (i.e., they in future use another freelancer or, decides to update etc.) do you keep static (like scrapbook, or repo) stuff...? how does that factor if it\\'s not in production? rock on @iamsamhankins  t h a n k s for letting us pick your brain @storbeck  (camperbot will cancel out anyway) did you animate 7 segment led font ? the thought crossed your mind i bet lol @jasonbbelcher coding has a zen like quality to it and then there\\'s the brain exploding parts geany i\\'m evaluating brackets still on the fence tried sublime etc., but always go back to geany i like brackets, but there\\'s the virtual machine feel that\\'s a bit off putting  just naming an editor \\'sublime\\' gets points for boldness go for geany, if you want distraction free i like the color popup in brackets howdy @gustavojmarrero  and @tweetytris  @aditya8061 , also posting code (or link to codepen) will multiply your chances of getting an answer don\\'t surround the integer with quotes though when you do it you could even go lower tech and use bluefish that\\'s one of the things about brackets (all the previous discussion) , it\\'s enabled to debug itself (if dev/user is so inclined) i.e., it sort of blurs the lines between tool and tool of tool the content rolls over the static contact stuff at bottom it looks very nice...  the footer is dynamic based on how you drag stuff updown the top part is what isn\\'t responsive.... imo there\\'s a world of difference in the two @thec0mposer  robust is really relative to complexity. things that you\\'re pulling via json requests are \\'document type\\' data and fall into the realm of things like mongodb (non-relational).... relational data is much more complex -entity relationships keys, pk/fk etc. start with codd, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relational_model - the visual will help you get the (no pun) picture  never neglect the database @jbmartinez omg, you\\'ve embraced the dark side (design) lol i totally just star\\'d that react? meatloaf? hiya @srozka  phoenix rising? neat no thank you @jbmartinez , you wrote stuff lol does the gitter session refresh? (i.e., will those now defunct links go away) or , is there reference that needs to be manually updated  the update performed was to the wiki (and links) (i think the room aspect was a separate operation) i.e., @shifthawke \\'s comments mein deutsch ist schlecht, geben sie mir bitte maissuppe your task list keeps growing @shifthawke  hi @tanyagupta  svt? isn\\'t that some performance line of ford vehicles? oh, that\\'s bad... go for the ford instead  what\\'s the dinosaur thing ? never seen it maybe it\\'s skewed by timezone i\\'m pretty cautious with anything ms but i thought http://www.sitepoint.com/the-es6-conundrum/ was interesting (built in bias alert) when you put it that way, all the concerns just seem to wash away i\\'ve avoided javascriptissexy on purpose... i\\'m not sure why for my shirt, it hurts no, i don\\'t think it\\'s the title no issue with catwalk either no, i see a lot of questions that seem to come from that site... and i\\'m wondering is it good for javascript learning... or does it teach bad concepts etc... looking for input (but if i must , i\\'ll do my little turn on the catwalk) @engineerededge i like the tone (right out of the box) that author strikes  brownies bestowed : thanks @engineerededge  i just hope i\\'m not going down the dark side of javascript learning with javascriptissexy bye @kimkwanka  @engineerededge , that\\'s on my list too.... but the \\'closures with ease\\' perks my eyes up a bit more so, are there 30 people here or 20,030 ? (20,000 \\'lurkers\\') you know who you are ( @shifthawke ) i was joking with  chris (but notification settings are probably off) @jbmartinez  hi @ali-castleford  @roamingblue are you using js console? in browser hi, and hello @vinhdao  what\\'s the feature request process? (i.e., yes... fork it etc., but don\\'t want to practice on production) for fcc a signout option (maybe where the git image resides in bar, top right of fcc page) would be handy. currently you have to go to the very bottom of the page (which grows dynamically as you progress) to sign out. for the free plan, is the required downtime period random?  hi @maffsojah  what was your question @hemant3370  ? i should be sleeping @hemant3370  is there a specific exercise that you\\'re stuck? hello @marqflournoy1  if you open it in its own tab (not embedded) it\\'s outputting correct weather info against a backdrop of videos at least for me i like the idea (case) for weather output (if rain show this vid, etc., etc.) it \\'works\\' (gawdy), missy elliot in a weather app... around 630am est is funny as heck heya @prodevweb  welcome @sanspace  crockford is pretty straight to the point,  (also, enjoy his commentary on ms influence (bad) in the early years of js) @kimkwanka yep, douglas crockford  repetition is important, but too much i begin to tune out @shifthawke are you advertising fcc rooms again? lol http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp js\\' allowance of mixed datatypes in arrays still throws me  hi @treslina  why does yoplait have an inner \\'lip\\' on its containers? bad design flaw  @johneycodeup  with requisite limitations on sql  she-batman? batperson i love that i can look in the right pane (people) and see an avatar of a wookie. that\\'s community right there.   your welcome is scary yes well yes, you have to mention cats (they are our overlords) well, that worse that\\'s lol never heard of it (although webpage looks to be some builder site)... or i\\'m confusing with norse mythology  aren\\'t you supposed to be  using an api (not \\'hardcoded\\' quotes) but to get a random sample you need a lot of... oh, nvm @hansinla a fallback is good @jbmartinez that has got me thinking, could you get jsonp called on an external file? no, yo estaba hablando de un archivo externo @jbmartinez nice nooo resist @saintpeter  resit lol ok, @shifthawke i wanna test the gitter markup with your tour greeting. is this ok? welcome to freecodecamp! i will be your tourguide.\\nwe have a [casual room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/casual) and a [help room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help). \\ni am she-batman. over there *(sometimes)* is \\'hugs and kisses\\' @0x0936 and \\'jaybeebaybee\\' @jbmartinez. we\\'re here to chat or help, whichever you desire. welcome to freecodecamp again. beware the cats. cats make everything seem better. wear a cat shirt (big cat picture on front) to an interview. they\\'ll say \\'well, it\\'s a tough decision... but that candidate with the big cat shirt was...\\' @shifthawke i don\\'t think so... but look at the gitter markup dropdown omg, the meme leviathan has been unleashed in the main room run @lawlietblack i\\'m totally not surprised (cat shirt) @tmartin2089 people test, test, test.

(is there an automatic message, icon, blah blah) yes, @thec0mposer ...  there are a lot of sql resources out there.... and \\'from\\' is going to be in pretty much everything you do in a statement (independent of its complexity) in select that is,  at this point, @thec0mposer ....  update and delete... are not recommended lol or drop myfavtablewithlotsofforeignkeys ..... i\\'d avoid that too  @shifthawke  dis your laptop come with windows 10 or was it an upgrade (guess is the latter) dis = did what kind of laptop is it? brand wise i\\'d hold off on buying something else still, the cheese dog might be a security setting (as well as a driver issue)\\nhttp://www.surfacetablethelp.com/2015/08/fix-windows-10-camera-app-not-working-something-went-wrong.html\\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_devices/camera-not-working-on-surface-3-error-something/915220b7-da24-4c45-a811-ffb5e826569d?auth=1 yes, not asus centric... but apply concepts i\\'m really showing great restraint in not dissing windows lol welcome @lifeburner try it without quotes see, doesn\\'t that make the welcome even better? (camperbot becomes sad when not able to use markup and regex) cheese dogs that\\'s what i\\'m looking sometimes you can remove everything attached to certain controllers and then let win re-find it will detect the hardware that\\'s what @benmcmahon100 is saying there are usb controllers (in this case your webcam is internal) if you delete the controller, it will re-aquire everything in the tree does that make sense? @shifthawke = locked on to webcam issue laser focus no, it would stop the crashing part... until you diagnose the issue safe mode only loads core drivers etc.,  (so, it\\'s half-a^^ mode for all intents and purposes (i.e., limited, so other stuff doesn\\'t load while you\\'re diagnosing)) totally \"hey, let\\'s push windows 10 for upgrade\"... \"will it break compatibility?\" \"probably, but who cares\" unconvinced @benmcmahon100 lol @benmcmahon100 , but now the updates are mandatory.... you can\\'t say the same (i.e., system stability) and hour or day from now.... lol do the tour take a break from hardware install linux no, has nothing to do with webcam.... install linux love computing again while you\\'re doing that can you get some cheese dogs on the way back? hiya @davidamandoestrada  i think one of the quaid brothers looks like zztop now (as well as \\'returning from canada\\')  the front end part is as well (yes, we get into win vs. linux here). a lot of the editors, ide (and general tools) are os agnostic (there are exceptions)... go linux! the tools icon  the settings are \\'per room\\'  fyi linux is far and away better for anything approaching backend or admin (which there\\'s obvious overlap) yeah, i know (the silence typically reveals ms fans) lol i have windows in a vm... there are things i have to use it @hungrysteven check out http://www.regexr.com/...  i\\'d take a break,  regroup and stuff hi @iseliget  weird looks like a poodle when scaled down test your regex (it\\'s a solitary endeavor) yeah, my plan was to work at taco bell... but i didn\\'t aim high enough hiya @eranfarkash  ok do they have taco bell in germany? are you running a server? (you mentioned \\'on your computer\\') i have great appreciation for mechanics (\"yeah, i\\'ve got this problem with my car\", \"what kind of problem?\", \"oh, you know it doesn\\'t work right\", \"uh, huh, can you tell me more?\") where does the picture reside? @eranfarkash, you would probably need to upload to an image service, then you that reference in your src howdy @mjespero  wait, i just realized you *don\\'t * have taco bell? tacos sind lecker. sie müssen taco bell haben sorry i read that wrong lol but that\\'s what sets you apart @zac247  that\\'s encouraging @kimkwanka  lol i feel like i just took one of the two pills in the matrix scene well, i found out that i have to eat what resembles watery oatmeal - and i\\'ve got to plug something into the back of my head @hungrysteven, timeout   @hungrysteven also, you probably need to look at how your approaching (globally) your exercises. in addition to the regex aspect, you need to find a way to test your code. (some people use the javascript console in browser, some run with node, etc.) but bouncing back and forth line by line with \"this\"? , \"how about this\"? is not going to help you in the long run (and will, likely, make people\\'s head(s) explode).   for now though, part of your problem is regex @hungrysteven goto http://www.regexr.com/.... you can experiment with patterns there do this for 20 minutes, the return then typing isn\\'t a js strong point (or point) sipping coffee sounds good @zac247  what kind of coffee are you drinking? waits for the answer because of @0x0936 \\'s shameless plug for the casual room lol well, we were talking about cheese dogs  so, anything not cheese dog related is generally frowned upon @qmikew1 can only imagine they totally ripped off japanese shows from the early 1970s welcome @sarunasp  @sarunasp many people feel silly saying \\'h e l l o w o r l d\\' the string is an argument to the function (tip) @kimkwanka , @jbmartinez is in laser focus mode but is not cooperating with my assessment of such lol it\\'s cheese-dog centric but can be general javascript is very lax about many things... but some things it\\'s not you can also, put a lot things within things (high degree of flexibility ) but have been used to strong (or actually exists) typing it\\'s problematic, in some ways with type coercion  if your present self and future self meet... it\\'s bad this is too deep. can we go back to cheese dogs, or regex? i can see (on the edges, and not fully developed) javascript\\'s approach (again, i could be wrong ...ask me tomorrow) and its power, but the \\'bad parts\\' i think will help with a fuller understanding there\\'s network stuff that creates delay you talk @shifthawke why are you recording yourself recording so, what\\'s the reason for jumping from room to room during twitch? well,  that was interesting it is, and has a great community there\\'s a toll charge for room changes @brianamarie thanks for the link (the other twitch was offline) heya @moh-aln  @jbmartinez  you might be able to switch up the flash settings :https://pubs.vmware.com/horizon-61-view/index.jsp?topic=%2fcom.vmware.horizon-view.desktops.doc%2fguid-8ce3908a-95b2-4d4d-9e00-b924e0d6d400.html @jbmartinez are you using firefox on this? try this: https://support.mozilla.org/en-us/questions/1009940 hiya @steven503  @camperbot you\\'re so vigilant  that\\'s totally lame @jbmartinez  @jedpimentel yes that\\'s why javascript has bolts in its neck twitch is totally flaking out on me loops before functions imo i\\'m afraid to use es6 stuff, it reminds me of vendor extension of functionallity for ff has it been fully adopted (i\\'ve seen a lot of stuff that i\\'d like to really use)? ugh the bane closures follows logically (of course) functions... but objects is easier to digest  sort of objects are make single page apps then do mondays suck in s. america too yeah, i haven\\'t even put anything in mine... @buzzlightyear90 , you\\'re way ahead in the game blender what\\'s the deal with links in twitch (i.e., why can you link references here (in gitter) but it\\'s more spammy in twitch)? there\\'s a chat feature in twitch; however, you can\\'t post links  hello @mashnew1234  @bomholt , there are sites where you can test.... (also, in linux there are test methods using set file sizes etc.) woodworking is very zen pizza dough, or denaro eating it is totally not (zen) - devour  energy it takes? you\\'d have to have an index somewhere @iheartkode  oh, i see why you were talking about hash earlier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1208222/how-do-i-implement-a-dictionary-or-hashtable-in-javascript i think, (i\\'m totally not following the convo) i think twitch did it to me corned beef hash is good too because i = 1 in the var and will always be <= 3 but you\\'re using \\'while\\' and yeah that breaks execution \\'return\\' agressive? i can\\'t even spell it so, totally doesn\\'t apply oh, yeah all bets are off then i love the random aggressive quote.. is there a middle finger emote? welcome @shawnwtx  heya @alphanuma  and @blakekeng too welcome lol js borrowed a lot of syntax stuff from different places (just to make your head explode) and c there\\'s was a couple of lessor know languages too known but don\\'t apply that to bash scripting @bkgeek lol, but should be ok in js i\\'m trying to absorb things in \\'vanilla\\' js before attempting es6 (although there\\'s some handy stuff in there) @bkgeek depends (although you should stick to one for consistency) ... i use quotes in different contexts with other stuff (besides js) i\\'m trying a new javascript infusion course... (you listen to subliminal javascript messages through water dripping and aerosmith) me either i knew there was a catch codecamp is filtered? that seems rather counterproductive  it\\'s very good the octopus metaphor (ok, in that context analogy) is applicable beyond variables in eloquent js turned off the stream a couple of hours ago it flaked on me are you still \\'twitching\\' (is that the verb for in session twitch.tv) what is that? what\\'s the purple thing? > sounds uncomfortable  ok, i\\'ve discovered some feature in gitter.... everything is highlighted in purple or pink wtf is that? welcome @carapeer  @shifthawke , are you going for some bf marathon? probably not able to respond because of the twitching @1234matt  was trying to follow your question no, it\\'s a bit open ended i think java was pushed a lot by some universities (cs departments) shortcuts?  haven\\'t found any (am still learning it (js) too). i think as you go along, you begin to pickup on the different philosophies being employed 1. it\\'s not java (unlearn some stuff). 2. data typing is sort of non-existent... 3. things live inside of other things (the potential nesting levels trip me out). 4. it\\'s a real language that\\'s no longer bound to traditional things the stream keeps crashing on my end @shifthawke  @1234matt that\\'s probably not very helpful; however, there are a lot of seasoned js folks that will probably give you some additional tips @1234matt it is smart to an extent.... but type coercion can be a problem i think it has to do with the flexibility of the language.... to me something as simple as mixed data types within an array is pretty new/profound howdy @lianliu  there\\'s the implicit declaration... it\\'s late, i think i\\'m losing some brain power here incoherent  are you on autopilot?  no, @jbmartinez ... but you could be as well, @1234matt :smile:  i used an emote oh, the decline @lianliu where are you in your learning....? looks good @salmanak  (pay particular attention to mark twain\\'s quote) there are so many way \\'smart people\\' can talk themselves out of greatness (it\\'s not always external (so, i\\'d break with twain a bit there) wow, no sleep and a busy monday = deep thoughts and emotes quick, cheese dogs or cats or a meme lol nice ty @iheartkode and @1234matt  the first cut in the mix is sort of floaty then totally harsh lol the monsta fellow, i think, was spurned at some point me? i\\'m totally not in europe....i\\'m in se u.s.a you\\'ve lost many hours that i still have... they have something called \\'daylight savings time\\' here...  it\\'s weird the atomic brain song (in mix) is pretty nice... electronica seems to have more of a swagger to it these days i mean you\\'re not actually saving daylight seems counter to internal (human) clock @1234matt whenever you can find the time @iheartkode the wicked sway clip is indeed wicked @iheartkode about 10:39 into the mix it\\'s called sodden or something there\\'s sort of an industrial hint to it against more of a hip hop beat hard to describe yeah @1234matt  i will have to sleep at some point wow, there\\'s this part where it sounds like droids are rebelling @shifthawke  you gotta listen to some of this mix of @iheartkode \\'s awesome @shifthawke  congrats the level counter needs to be reset  dupstep = not sleepy time music i can\\'t pause it (i mean i can, there\\'s no technical obstruction) math says: \\'all have come\\' although, i can understand the attitude towards math...  especially with soundtrack me either, maybe i\\'ll wait till later to address controller the regex is a bit off on that you have to put the hot pink reference in there  zombie css reference zombie cats the best i\\'m able to see in my mind\\'s eye the zombie cat concept (to be applied in some upcoming project) only because of this music of @iheartkode \\'s eptic track i think that\\'s \\'pro\\' version why do some codepens display with edit (which is good for troubleshooting) and some appear \\'compiled\\' (i.e., no edit option)... is there a setting that does this?  so, if wanted to evaluate (in most cases, folks have the edit option enabled (good) a pen that pops up with (\\'need feedback on this\\') i would need to be logged into codepen itself to control the view options of other pens? thanks @jbmartinez , @daynewr , @arielleslie  (just swap with*pen* in the actual url worked!) streaming is sometimes over used in corporate scenarios ironic lol what\\'s the point of the bonfire twitch (not a sarcastic question btw), like big picture? but the interaction doesn\\'t seem to be a front-end project type of interaction (i.e., just \\'as is service\\' ) like i\\'m typing this response, but i haven\\'t tweaked some gitter api to do it does that make sense? @brianamarie, i think the zipline portion will probably give me some insight... but the streaming can be multi-utility ... so, it\\'s throwing me off a bit your regex isn\\'t defined correctly ```\\nvar expression =  teststring.replace(/yourpattern/g,\"\");\\n``` heya @shivashinde  @federog the actual regex pattern is problematic. you may want to try http://www.regexr.com/ ^even better i dig that too i believe you can save your tests and share the url with others @shivashinde a new editor is in your future (there\\'s atom, brackets, sublime, geany, notepad++ (and a million other things)... to test your code, there\\'s a lot of options in that category as well... javascript console in browser... codepen.... running node... lots, and lots of options jsfiddle.net too (haven\\'t used it ( i like to run locally) welcome @angelchizy  i don\\'t know what\\'s worse: a bot or being annoyed with a bot when you know its regex patterns @shifthawke  = twitch diva (just kidding) @shifthawke , just giving you a hard time (you\\'ve adapted quickly, and are excelling - good stuff)  nooooo cra^ not camperbot and its brownies. i\\'m pretty sure that camperbot has, in fact, achieved self awareness no, pbot is camperbot\\'s evil twin wow, it picks up on the underlying command of that emote you could populate a separate array with a number (if your condition meets) and if that array is > 0  return whatever hello @aldraco  i think it was the saturday before last it would be handy (if it\\'s there already disregard) to have a section on the fcc homepage that has intuitive linkage to the update streams is there a general protocol (it\\'s all about the git) for this kind of stuff...(i.e., there\\'s a saying don\\'t complain unless you have a solution, which is really applicable in a dev/or aspiring-dev community)?  or a feedback preference or discussion type of thing... (this is sort of a hybrid political/tech question) ? but it\\'s not a bug oh, i see... there\\'s \\'open source\\' ; however, the master branch is somebody\\'s pride and joy. so, there\\'s kind of a in-built protocol that varies by branch master...i guess (in terms of comments)...  looks like steven tyler you didn\\'t know that handel was actually the frontman for aerosmith? brian may is absolutely awesome the mic on your machine is really sensitive, @shifthawke . i could hear crickets on that stream nice, go for it @aoxom  looks good @aoxom , but you need to fill in some js/jquery stuff to make bach have sith lightening come out of his fingers (with brandenburg concerto music wall) to make it interesting @mckmillions welcome, you\\'ll learn lots here @mckmillions what kind of coding were you, initially, drawn?  what i like, is this is really kind of a startup in itself...  i like modular projects (i.e., that over there is the thing you\\'re working (on), this over here is what i\\'m working (on)).... yes, i said it: i find pairing annoying lol @kunal-mandalia i\\'m more inclined to backend-dev... the front dev experience learning stuff doesn\\'t hurt totally @kunal-mandalia , that\\'s an interesting question... i\\'d say depends: the technical infrastructure behind things (in non-trivial enterprise level scenario) will never completely morph into a front end thing welcome @androidjim .... let me guess, you\\'re favorite mobile platform is ios based? lol (just kidding) you\\'re = your i am not special enough to have a working edit button there\\'s eloquent javascript that\\'s a good starter do you have an existing knowledge of js ? @wishe  i was asking because some of these books /series may be targeting advanced js \\'ninjas\\'... my recommendation  is to have the basics down first (and this is entirely subjective) before getting into the subtleties  crockford\\'s videos are great advanced and simple at the same time they\\'re for making s\\'mores and making your head explode (the bonfires are challenging and fun) is the twitch experience relatively stable for most viewers (it flakes out on me)? @shifthawke  stare at a file of gibberish characters for a few minutes, repeat. +1 for frank zappa @julianpalladino you can get a feel for how non-profits benefit (and indirectly what\\'s expected from a qualified candidate + what\\'s in it for you type stuff) by clicking the i\\'m a nonprofit button (just as a read type thing) i kind of view some of these paid bootcamps like a rush-rush truck driving program (i.e., learn to drive the \\'big rigs\\' in a week -- and make lots of money)  the volume of free resources (to learn anything) totally amazes me i do too - yep, you\\'re right @travishi  @trilliun , i\\'d be up front with them straight away... it will make the chances of success much greater. you\\'ve already secured an interview, there\\'s something that they see as an asset (don\\'t cram with lots of half baked stuff)   right before (imo) they pickup on that (i think your reasoning is sound) hiya @borivoje  you\\'ll get lots of js related stuff in this curriculum  there are extensions to sql functionality that vary by vendor plus, you need to know what kind of data you\\'re going to be working with (i.e., relational or non-relational) oh, lord lol @jbmartinez  is kidding folks ? like this very chat? i would suppose so (since conversation if by definition not predetermined)  oh, like a support chat i see what you\\'re saying sigh yes, let\\'s go back to 1960s file systems to store data that would be almost valid piping in linux except it would be somepowerpoint > myinsanelybadfile.txt well, i\\'m pretty sure sql tuning isn\\'t in your future there @davidamandoestrada  lol so, will i have to have a cart of money to by cheetos? buy by? like standing by cheetos great, i can\\'t type either unfortunately he knows this all too seriously  thanks for bumming him out lol camperbot... i know you\\'re not an actual person.... and i know the actual regex that you use, but seriously, can you just take a fu**en break once in a while? lol the bots in twitch are really bad i logged in for the first time recently moobot? who put  t a x as a form of \\'th a n ks\\'? lol  see? i have to space my characters out (as to not release the kraken) lol lol what\\'s that? yeah no, that vacum  cleaner? that\\'s the (classic) latin spelling of the cleaning device that that what\\'s that @shifthawke  ok, i\\'ll put on my anime face (how\\'s is this helping me exactly)? lol lol wow ok, don\\'t do that the full page thing bad or if you stand many yards back opaque you mean? totally reminds me of transparent gifs that were (and sadly still) used for spacing possum divs well it saves on storage, i think it\\'s what? 1x1 px yes, be bold... go complete table layouts lol i love websites that aren\\'t mobile responsive.... i\\'m like wtf? come on now... i see some still wow, 1000 and to a saint collages are pretty why would make fun of somebody who likes collages? you it\\'s not in svg.... so it will be all pixalated looking unless you get some obnoxiously expensive add-on for ps although, you could \\'re-create\\' it in all its fine detail glory ok, got a screenshot too you could put a pretty rose border around it lol hello two weeks from now what are you doing? do a seminar with a whiteboard i just realized twitch with t dropped is witch ahhh me too, it is one of the best tools ever hiya @majeye  they had a street fighter competition the same time as your twitch @shifthawke  that just sounds wrong don\\'t do it you\\'re not in the \\'learning zone\\'... if you attempt to do difficult tasks while exhausted (or perhaps, frustrated)... it tends to make eye (yes just one eye) bulge...  hmmm what side of equality  math is goo lol i saw that too late all the server farms and infrastructure and stuff... just to make it possible for camperbot to give brownies oh, yeah... i see all worth it not like blinking stuff on webpages in the 1990s no sir, but you shouldn\\'t be using that @jbmartinez  , remember?  totally it appears that there is some fly that turns honey bees into zombies... (as well as an alien like emergence of larvae ) -no joke, weird piece of news yeah, somewhere in rain forest  sure thing @vitolob  here\\'s a good one .lenthg why i love node and jslint the cli aspect looks very nice i\\'m bookmarking -- brownies for you: @jbmartinez  thanks @jbmartinez  yeah, i have a linter in brackets (that i\\'m still on the fence) but it\\'s quirky awesome..... brownies i haven\\'t attempted to do on mobile you\\'d almost have to (to be congruent) write code *for* mobile = ok... write code *on* mobile = torture i can\\'t see dev on a phone being a viable platform any time soon.... (yes, there are exceptions with tablet type stuff) the actual development. on... not the deployment yeah real keys are required.... (hence laptop is ideal) they were smaller in the old days.... (right after the motorola brick....there\\'s was competition to see who could come up with the smallest phones) well before the internet i can\\'t wait to carry my laptop sized phone on a belt  fanny packs (aka laptop sized phone carrier) will be all the rage once more oh, joy @jbmartinez  it\\'s funny you should mention sony.... i was listening to an interview about organizational behavior patterns... that allowed sony to pretty much drop the ball with music players and letting the ipod do its thing  so, to me ipod (and later phone) while revolutionary in marketing/timing etc., things like palm, and sony really came up with a lot of ideas yeah, i was sitting through the mandatory \\'how many seconds\\' ad on a youtube vid.. and there was this \\'jobs\\' trailer (yes, there\\'s a movie about the founder)... it was really kind of overboard in \\'apple created everything\\' cra^(again, sony... linux , palm and others even, dare i say it ms) what\\'s up with apple dropping apps from their store all the time, @kevsmets92 ? oh, that\\'s fun @perkyaayushi , there\\'s backend infrastructure that would make that less than viable as a repo type thing (i.e., per user stuff) what\\'s the purpose for copying and pasting? hello @gollodev  you\\'re forking an empty shell of functionallity.... you\\'re not forking the database contents (thank goodness) i would say that what you\\'re describing wouldn\\'t work ^ nice. welcome @resistorman  because you\\'re not cloning the backend database just the front end shell rock on @resistorman  don\\'t listen to camperbot all your stuff is saved that\\'s a lot of hours of streaming.... (getting into truman show territory) lol wow :metal:  the fcc shirt would be better without the description and just the logo (yes, i\\'m harping on this) @peazzoni1 you may want to display the operators in between the calcs the iconic aspects are lost @majeye  i really \\'love\\' how arrays are sorted (by default in lexicographical form even if they\\'re integers) in js welcome @ryanhduong  i want the two hours of my life back lol i would say the social (read community) aspect helps to keep one motivated... it\\'s kind of a unique fcc thing. @teejayparker you totally renamed yourself  that would be a good gratis project @shifthawke , that\\'s not a bad choice (because, a lot of this stuff is solitary and streaming can become \\'watch me cook eggs\\' or \\'here i am looking for baked chickens\\') lol will you be doing the baked chicken thing? har to the har i think that would be a compelling stream don\\'t steal my idea lol thinking in java and translating to javascript doesn\\'t work yes, totally... (however, some of the questions imply there\\'s some \\'thinking in java\\' going on) i know what it is and it isn\\'t i\\'m just saying... that you\\'ll go mad  with that approach but baked chickens are much more compelling either way hello @linkei  and welcome @jjlippman  @jjlippman good stuff. start on the exercises,  if you get stuck... there\\'s help available  type colon select from drop :heart_eyes_cat:  @housewar nice full metal jacket reference to your portfolio  i want the laser eye implant  top level (big picture) learning works for me (why i like crockford vids).... i need to know why i\\'m doing something (vs. a lot of disparate pieces of stuff)  although i run from recursion, and find nice comfy solace in iterative things...  not always, @kimkwanka  in can be non-performant @kimkwanka will if you\\'re going for code bling, i can\\'t disagree lol @timothyjt , give you a couple of hints (if you like) 1: you\\'re targeting a small subset of what\\'s considered punctuation (or other characters) 2: some characters are \\'fun\\' in regex (hope that\\'s not too cryptic) @timothyjt https://regex101.com and http://regexone.com/ will make your life easier bye @kimkwanka  @shifthawke if you\\'re going to demonstrate wapoints (as if they\\'ve never done), i think you can go to http://freecodecamp.com/map without logging in they\\'ve = were never done.. (i really need to fix my edit) #hello @jgtwo1  take that camperbot: my font is bigger than yours lol wait your mic is ultra sensitive don\\'t eat anything like beans no, that\\'s good usually people have the opposite problem  crickets tumbleweeds  what happened? welcome @jimburke1  so, you talked to one recruiter out of 900 billion  recruiters can be helpful; however, a lot are cheesy-shark types as well yeah, fcc is pretty new... i\\'m not sure that some industry bias has developed don\\'t let it derail your progress this recruiter sounds like they\\'re not very creative (or plugged in to innovation). you see they have to \\'sell\\' your skills etc., and if they don\\'t understand something... they\\'re going to poo poo it.  the last line is the takeaway  wow, it\\'s even quieter than before ... in here i\\'m still awake though well nothing like a timezone \\'touch base\\' how you interact with clients is as important as your technical competency  it can be frustrating to deal with lack of technical knowledge (with regard to clients), but put yourself in their shoes... when you get your car serviced , do you really give a cra^ about all the minutiae or do you just want it fixed/improved? because you didn\\'t var the pop\\'d array you get a free toaster at 200 @timothyjt  that\\'s a pretty nice toaster yeah, you couldn\\'t possibly affix bouncing eye stickers to a toaster yourself for under $1,000 here\\'s some brownie points to get you closer to the coveted toaster: thanks @timothyjt  nice if you\\'re talking about the functionality in the exercises, i\\'d say no... but you can paste your code what colors to they come? hash i could have sworn i saw something closer to -hash- 000099 @jctm30 i\\'m not familiar with the site but: https://pixabay.com/en/service/faq/ @briancbarrow do you have a codepen? for this  @briancbarrow , i saw a lot of target_blank stuff... maybe it\\'s because there\\'s no js click stuff or that it\\'s wrapped in just an anchor (maybe a form element would work  --) -- i saw the worked like a charm part (glad it worked) but when i refresh the pen it still doesn\\'t work  omg you\\'re not a robot @briancbarrow  lol yes, can confirm that it works  now you gotta work on the navbar @briancbarrow  @briancbarrow could be the resolution that i have window set but nothing is reoriented when home, about, portfolio, etc., is select.... (maybe is supposed to scroll or drop (i didn\\'t look at the underlying functionallity) selected @briancbarrow  i missed the place holder aspect, my apologies  @carl-parrish  i think that last test is factoring if you applied the regex correctly (thus removing the middle stuff) then it\\'s testing on integers only camperbot\\'s eyes should turn red when saying that yeah, what\\'s that? is it like some sort of talent pool thing (i.e., from which the large companies draw from contestants?) you\\'re supposed to kind of give the idea not the actual idea + execution *sigh* lol uh, huh what about the other 20,000 folks ? js is fun sometimes, sometimes it\\'s a serious pita it\\'s very lax on stuff (js) good and bad to that implicit typing has its pros cons too but you\\'d have to convert it to a string if you wanted to fix the decimal places there are just weird traps (i\\'m still on my js journey as well) that you run into  with js.... not bad/good... just weird at times here\\'s an example.... run a sort on an array filled with integers (i ran into this earlier today)... if you don\\'t pass argument/function within the sort, the default behavior is lexicographical (even on integers) you could split it by \"\" sorry the join part  i just try to help with general concepts but you\\'re going to want to split by something and then join into another array by \"\"  also, strings are immutable  http://regexone.com/ https://regex101.com is even better.... that was a fun bf there\\'s more fun bf fun ahead the general application would be http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp ; however, instead you\\'ll be using regex patterns whatever.replace(/somepattern/g, \"\") the did @figjeti , now they have stainless steel stuff on all the stoves and fridges i\\'ve seen some sites that still look 1995 and aren\\'t mobile responsive you\\'re going to have to chunk that out a bit and expand your regex to include as @hermanfassett says, other punctuation (or lack of ) ... you need to read up on the regex first perhaps, but having knowledge of it early on will give you \\'eureka!\\' much earlier in the game  there\\'s some irony there with camperbot and regex lol hiya @srinukatari  if you have to do any pre-processing of large files ( @primitivelogic ) the eureka! will come to you in an instant... case in point, (stipulate that there are specific tools for this) if you wanted to remove certain tags from a 10,000 line file how would you do that without regex (i.e., the tags have pattern but the contents are of different values) ? how would you solve it without regex then? (you can, but it\\'s just an example) what would it look like? air code it ok, return the values between all tags say<p></p> in a monster file of varying length of course i stipulated that iterate by line (could be a massive line) or by character? the tag thing is just for example... depends. if you\\'re using it in a stream editor... i can assure you that it\\'s not using the overhead of manually looping through each character in a js loop if you\\'re writing something that is wholly inefficient with gobs of conditionals with line upon line of something (that may not even work) and that is not performant, that isn\\'t a sign of good programming but its inclusion in tutorial (here and elsewhere) argues against that in javascript, not long... in general, since the 1980s  how about you? btw nobody is saying one has to be some regex guru... it\\'s the knowledge of it that is powerful (if embraced even to a minimal extent - if not, do whatever...) if i have to create gitter before i can use gitter (every time i use it) or fashion a wheel (just for the problem solving aspects before driving a car) doesn\\'t make me a genius  it\\'s weird, you never know what topic sparks spirited debate which is tastier.... turkey or chicken? what is it a matter? do you hand file each bolt? because the car will have cost overrun  there are levels of abstraction that i think are being missed in the philosophical approach (which is what @0x0936  is getting at i think) if you\\'re interviewing for a position and you have 700 lines of code where it could have taken 20, do you think the person evaluating would say \\'this person is the best\\'? battery no worky long. here\\'s the answer to my own question: \\'no\\' @shifthawke it seems that you grew a beard and were streaming under the fcc tampa cummunity last night lol community gitter has some spell check flaws @bschaden you may be on to something in terms of sequence http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_system.asp eww oh, no not paranormal html @ushankhan  did the same thing with javascript (i.e., \\'jscript\\') early on i think i may still have your tour i can pm it (with formatting) if you like @shifthawke   which would be 99.9% not probable for a first time \\'hello world\\' @allanarmstrong lol wow , there\\'s a translation room? @sammi-93 what\\'s the issue? amen welcome @yragc80  or pink shoes in general? too, bad it will help your coding captain america... he has some sort of powers (kind of like wolverine sans the claws) well, if you have batman like in a bar without all of his batman stuff... and superman... i think i know who would win i mean superman flew around the world at high rate of speed to reverse time. a batman utility belt seems to pale in comparisson well, that\\'s really a product of stretching the bounds to make for good story (i.e., the new movie premise of batman vs. superman). taken to the logical extreme, you could have batman vs. jesus there\\'s more to the superman story (i.e., other than marlon brando sending him off in a space capsule (which i guess could be some weird metaphor of wheat field) ?? form of \\'tub of ice cream\\'....  what was their mascot\\'s name oh, you didn\\'t see the \\'new cap\\'... he looks like weird al\\'s take off on bad the monkey\\'s name was gleek? oh, i think you\\'re right @jbmartinez (without even googling) i haven\\'t heard that word in a couple of decades #gleek sounds a lot like phil hartman\\'s frankenstein character @shifthawke keeps downing my idea about a new super hero named troutman there\\'s a what? i don\\'t that\\'s a superhero  not cap the other ewwww that\\'s eel man wtf is that really a superhero? where are you getting retval? i assume nothing heya @c0d9x  there\\'s no loop setup there i\\'m doing bonfires (i got really sidetracked with angular - and redoing progress from changeover) how do you like it so far? @c0d9x  syntax errors are the best @arielleslie that\\'s so true (kind of like using \\'to\\' where \\'too\\' should be used: would never register) don\\'t skip the html... it\\'s the backdrop but i get it. i wanted to get right to js yep brownies are the perfect cavity vector: they\\'re full of cra^ and they stick to your teeth but oh, so good yes, yes.... you get it hang on test thanks @aalve  yes, and only for the sake of brownies see, and it also registered the brownies you had (when you couldn\\'t see those i\\'m really annoyed that octopus adoption at mall kiosks is under represented  sure dogs and cats are cute and all.... but the octopus always is the one left hiya @ivojercic  @arielleslie not sure, but i see some cap. kirk in that main character totally the loop looks problematic (imo) you want to run your comparisons inside the the loop... (i.e., give the loop iterator some room to do its job of just being, well, a \\'looper\\') which i\\'ve heard is very tasty with lemon hi, @notableotter  this weird on a mobile device it\\'s a totally different experience. it sucks ok, my \\'journey with gitter  (and to some degree, fcc) on mobile \\' sucked. so, back to laptop i feel whole again lol shutter and ksnap (if you\\'re kde) are good if you want to crop before you paste  https://docs.c9.io/discuss/557ecf787eafa719001d1af8 (use with care) @imransb ah, my edit functionality is back again heya @vitolob and @dorafo  let\\'s see if edit is working oh, yeah! nice... finally it was not working for a couple of weeks @vitolob http://www.regexr.com/ https://regex101.com i\\'ve tried the gitter app (linux version) and found no compelling reason to use it over the browser based version (in fact, some stuff doesn\\'t work as well) @welldressed , you don\\'t need (but helps ) any prior knowledge looks like an ad codeacademy\\'s basic js is really bad (other offerings, not as) sure feel locked into some sort of drone existence? like camperbot ? oh, yeah... the \\'bobs\\' scene is so close to reality of the late 1990s  and today glengarry glen ross (although, slightly different \\'always be closing\\') you can look at the repo @welldressed  there are differences between git and organizational stuff (which is true of pretty much everything) points were carried over i believe (at least in my case) @v3rse  i.e., when the beta went production (a couple of months ago?) the map looks different (there\\'s new stuff)... and you\\'ll have some stuff checked already etc. np we\\'re not worthy, we\\'re not worthy lol that happened to me too @kimkwanka  (even though node was practically yelling at me \\'hey, you idiot there\\'s no such thing as .lngth\\') gitter lagging like crazy camperbot is not  a guy and self aware you could say shlang instead of slang dhingbwatus wif kwawacters i like it let\\'s build the dictionary lol bye @stimpygato  does gitter \\'flake out\\' on anybody at times? (weird lags etc.) @jbmartinez yeah, maybe it\\'s all of the various embedded stuff that contributes  console.log  won\\'t return anything for function output help formatting back on mobile. yea did you lose your tour again uh huh you should add cat emote oh yeah good stuff make sure you have parachute pants handy am on mobile did i mention im on mobile loo help formatting im pretty limited to just invoking the evil camperbot when on mobile @shifthawke you did another stream? how did it go nice need more designers with that mindset😀 for some reason i thought entertaining could probably describe the streams without even seeing it moths  and snorting dogs they always add to the web experience second only to cats voice to text is so weird yeah i\\'m on a mobile (totally sucks) and i\\'m talking to text so some random expletive blurts out it\\'s the processor not me always the processor do you guys put real data and your portfolios in not from the bs perspective but more as a privacy thing collective crickets chirp, chirp that makes it better some people eat crickets chocolate covered if starbucks old am i now i sound like yoda stupid processor what i meant to say was if starbucks sold them i would buy them yeah exercises are interesting and often send you in different directions for learning i had to go the route of anonymous functions yes i would eat chco crickets webbed footed greeting to you. welcome hiya @ggaroian  @teejayparker that\\'s neat (i.e., giphy\\'s media controls for, well, animated, gifs) smooth control transition on hover (nice) hi @jrowings  hi @ushankhan  @jrowings that\\'s a great reason... ! (and really honest) when you fix the href, you still have to change its value to make a dead-link @faseehx  congrats @allanarmstrong  @allanarmstrong (honestly, the backend dev stuff holds a lot of interest imo) @waterburner is that a cat version of jack sparrow? am more inclined to the backend aspect as well np at the rate technology is changing, i predict the microwave oven will be too slow not sure what you\\'re trying to do... but you may want to use .length on both strings if you\\'re trying to compare which is greater in length.  (also, \\'ls\\' is a common directory command in *nix systems) @vayl  @kkrzakk ubuntu i guess today is a bad day to sign up with/for codepen? oh, so you\\'re the one? that\\'s ok, there\\'s lots on the \\'sign-up\\' list (thinking about heroku) http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/codepen.io.html proof that @falsedave did, indeed, break codepen i haven\\'t gotten to the \\'god\\' zipline yet yeah, i saw that in google results (fcc) yeppers i always wonder what the reason is when sites go down (given there are redundancies etc.,) especially with sites that host code etc. doesn\\'t brackets use preview within browser (extract)? yes, i\\'m sure the claims folks were happy with you lol you know you have to relax a bit when you\\'re evaluating your baker\\'s code that is a seriously tasty looking cake  yeah i lost two hours figuring out the lexical sort (even on integers)  a couple of days ago... painful learning experince any thoughts on ruby (subjective, yes)i was looking at code curriculum (hint: run by thor\\'s father) and they seem to be really focused on ruby/rails  if you paste your code, it makes it easier to evaluate @boris-chantel  @arielleslie , i\\'m envisioning your ruby experience (context part) as some sort of westside story gang you have monospace on paragraph element(s) @newmand what waypoint is that? (directions give context) you would think camperbot would have more brownie points (sarcasm brownies) that might be better in a codepen backticks = bread code = turkey make the code sandwich one person can\\'t be a team of professionals nice (imo, you should change \\'i am a team of professionals\\' - just sayin) i saw this placeholder once \\'i eat squirrels\\' and the dev forgot to change it (ok, i\\'m kidding)  @jedpimentel lol @meatzie, welcome good luck @danielhulot  ambiguous question   i\\'m filling in about 20 different (what could be ) responses in my mind although, it could be mobile related... i tried this (gitter) on mobile with text-to-speech. i sounded like yoda. problems you will have with bootstrap, yyyyes, hmph i want to like brackets (like some have said) it\\'s a bit buggy i will say (in comparison to other(s) sublime is closer to \\'no bs\\' than brackets (geany is my goto) whoever mentioned hamburgers...thanks a lot  without the bread, just the hamburger i went back and redid the waypoints (i.e., new version.... where already completed in old).... wasn\\'t a big deal. some stuff was saved, so where there was a 1:1 it should show. but i signed up on the cusp and had to do codecademy\\'s basic js (which sucks to no end) yeah, if this was recently (i.e., waypoints progress) then ^ is applicable... i\\'m referring to those (like me) that signed up before the major update seen a few \\'haven\\'t been here for awhile (like months)\\' questions which is good (the homegrown stuff is better). http://freecodecamp.com/news/fcc-success-stories (haven\\'t read those, though) mileage may vary @codenonprofit yeah, i should have double-checked that (it\\'s one of the first search results)... looks as though it\\'s in camper news then sort of co-opts fcc logo   to somebody\\'s personal page i haven\\'t checked in a while... but i live close to rtp (research triangle park), and was surprised there weren\\'t any local meetups  yeah, but then i\\'d have to bring mixed nuts and coffee lol how do meetups work? (beyond the start--one procedure) ... i.e., what makes for a productive city/semi-regional meetup? you probably (aside from question) want to name your variables something other than array  hello @osnapitzjen  @jettcrowson , @takumar is correct... about the loop... (in fact, it will throw an error) have you considered (if you\\'re already doing, then disregard) testing your code in javascript console (or other means)? *may make things easier to sort out* heya @daiky00  welcome @divya-projects  for whatever reason, the community just \\'works\\' (i.e., it\\'s a great community) the soothing sound of the dial-up modem you\\'re not supposed to say that out loud lol i bet that it\\'s expensive to advertise on stack exchange (because you have an audience of nerds & ultra-nerds) @elektropay stack exchange is your friend not the loser drunken friend.... but your smart friend @jbmartinez i actually stopped for a moment and thought about their revenue model...  have you ever looked at the job board (have noticed it but never clicked it) ? is it any good @jbmartinez , not bad (just looked)... aside, from the ads...i saw a company that went to angular camperbot i was just saying camperbot (without particular invocation), (if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing lol) you could make it even better @javiermxmd : \\'undefined\\' (i.e., nothing, nothing) hi @shoichiaizawa  lol @abhisekp, yes... i know you work on camperbot  as much as i dis camperbot....it does interest me apple is sort of becoming the new ms (total irony)  yeah, i can see the visionary aspects... but this new movie (about jobs -from what i\\'ve seen in preview) goes over the top... with crediting (jobs) with everything under the tech sun (when all kinds of stuff came before)  although, i saw somewhere that somebody had/auctioned one of steve jobs\\' early business cards...(having something like is neat whether you\\'re an apple fan or not) heya, and howdy @heal25  @abhisekp i think you\\'re right about brackets (i think i\\'ve been using it around two weeks), it is kind of buggy... but still useful (with array of others) nice how does it feel? @jbmartinez i might just do that  i seriously have to upgrade my node version.... (it looks like they have an expiration date on packages that go back x time) that\\'s one of the things about ubuntu repos,  they have stale versions of a lot of things (love ubuntu/debian... but when it\\'s true, it\\'s true) @jbmartinez i ran an *apt-cache policy* on it .... and it\\'s so bad that... i\\'m downloading the the tar.gz file now.... 4.2.1  - @jbmartinez haven\\'t tried nvm  ... how has it worked for you? japanese = serenity corn chowder....  yeah, but there\\'s a lot of disagreement (japanese vs. chinese speakers).... i get \\'no, that means this\\'.... kanji (originally) comes from chinese characters  bye @abhisekp  @jbmartinez , does nvm work out for you ? oh, you already responded to that not to change the subject, but i tried this delicacy known as \\'potted meat\\' well, i don\\'t know exactly...have always been afraid of it there are some foods that you really want to avoid reading the ingredient list @allanarmstrong well, now you understand the apprehension  are meetups sort of a networking thing? (i\\'m really kind of on the fence about it) @jbmartinez nvm looks to be a bash script (so, easy to see what it\\'s doing) i wonder if the current node version has any effect on (i would guess not but... but it might be passing some args) i might just install this 4.2.1 and clone... nvm and see what happens (not that i\\'m a node expert..... just started using it) hi @mengedeth  bye @jbmartinez  -than -  (if you\\'re going to dis at least make it readable)  nooo @faseehx  @teejayparker (not to detract from the debate that\\'s going) you totally went corporate avatar what happened? lol @faseehx ,  not everything can be boiled down to fun. coding is hard (and fun too), you have to put the work into it  @johnny34 typos get all of us. trust me, you\\'re not stupid welcom @cslice18  welcome i\\'ve sworn off grammatically correct sentences for the morning regex needs to be tweaked bach! @aoxom looks good what\\'s the background? is it parched scoring sheet? @aoxom  that is true, i found myself wondering if the image footer would collapse or do something (has kind of a weird visual effect - but still looks good) if you don\\'t learn.... you have a 100% chance of failure it\\'s self doubt (it\\'s ok, push through it) lol or they\\'re written by recruiters who inject their own bias  i saw this one skills blurb by a recruiter (attached to the bottom of listing).... he/she went to great lengths to disparage javascript in favor of \\'real languages\\' (not exactly the verbage but message was clear) before even clicking the pen (and thus the question), white font (even with drop shadow) on white background = hard on the eyes i have the full pen preview... drop shadow bad! (says in phil hartman character voice) @duanwalker ok, let me actually look at the question that you asked lol @duanwalker  the get location by ip link returns flakey results, but how are you using that in context of the weather api link (doesn\\'t appear to be fallback, but is conflated)? @duanwalker  \\'$.getjson\\' might be a good way  @duanwalker , sorry i got sidetracked on the ip implementation (not your question) - i\\'ve seen other pens (very similar) that resolve city.. @duanwalker sorry, i\\'d have to re-write stuff just to get it to display my city (so, i can\\'t see/test)... will have to throw this to somebody else oh, look at that... codecademy wants me to learn java i don\\'t want to go down the java road, i wonder what\\'s driving their (codecademy) course offerings no, can\\'t be that @arielleslie yes, that makes sense... but why now? @arielleslie just kind of a weird deployment direction course wise (like you would have thought the opposite to be true)... @arielleslie if you go back some years,  \\'java\\', \\'c++\\'...were sort of \\'hot\\'  @arielleslie so, i\\'m wondering about the underlying demand flow (i.e., is there some sort of a rebirth in trend driven by (x)... ) you\\'re missing my point @alanbuchanan  lambda is not lost on javascript yes, \\'learn java\\' is what you\\'ll hear (no doubt about that) @arielleslie   yes, learn javascript.... it\\'s the anchor in the stack  welcome @austinmoore21  lol @storbeck  yes, the lack of strict typing hangs me up as well yes, @jaiminf  the syntax is borrowed from a million different places (but without the implementation)...for me part of where i run into problems is trying to think in one thing and apply it to js. the key, imo is that it has its own philosophy (good, bad, whatever) congrats @slolobdill44  it\\'s hard to be frustrated when there are cats make it so #1 does js lack of hash drive anybody crazy? those are tasty i\\'m still evaluating brackets @iheartkode it is totally, but sometimes it gets buggy @iheartkode yep i\\'ve got to update my node.... but i think i\\'ll \\'npm\\'  the browser sync heya @d227wang  i you\\'re the same person.... i commend you on your multi-user names (and \\'distinct personalities\\')   porkchop mixins? hi @quincylarson  @storbeck it has sort of a virtual machine feel to it (brackets) hard to expain that part is neat but wait, there\\'s more lol i should have been able to guess quicker (activity pane right for repo) very nice... (user won\\'t have to \\'search in dark\\', in terms of context (then can focus on issue vs. where to find)) @jbmartinez yeah, i saw that too ok, now i\\'m in the \\'slide-out\\' chat window.... wow, very slick and, you can expand back to the \\'native\\' gitter interface...  heya @sergistud  i think node is a dependency of brackets (i.e., it communicates over socket)  which reminds me (all of this discussion) i need to update node version @jamar0813 we\\'ve been waiting for you, welcome. lol why not both? meme i haven\\'t gotten to the task runners part yet... yeah good question @iheartkode  thanks @iheartkode .... i have to say \\'using streams\\' really caught my eye doh, you beat me to it @josephwasily another thing you\\'re going to need to account for is that a lot of  id(s) are dynamically generated (so, * in part of string search might help- but there are a lot of tools for this, and as @saintpeter says it\\'s really not trivial) @namsir the spin effect when you click the button is neat... (how do you reset?) -overall works on my end what\\'s the mechanism to reset the timer? (i.e., you click and it pauses (which is good)) @jbmartinez i still have this tar version (latest) of node,  i\\'m thinking before i install this i should run an apt-get purge on the current (stale ubuntu repo) version, ```\\n<!-- fyi (i learned this from other folks here)\\nif a codepen example is displayed in \\'full view\\',\\nyou can change \\'to pen view\\' by altering url\\n\\nhttp://codepen.io/someuser/full/somepenid/\\n                                                             ^ change this\\n\\n\\nhttp://codepen.io/someuser/pen/somepenid/\\n                                                             ^ to this \\n\\nthen you can evaluate the code etc., \\n-->\\n``` doh, gitter markup.... messes with spaces, grrrr does gitter (markup) have anything like <pre> ? have you finished all of curriculum benchmarks @erickpezoa ? @erickpezoa, i don\\'t have any unique insight (so, others here would probably be better to answer). but the the exercises, projects, etc.,  are the path (i.e., tangible items) to the non-profit projects.   gitter sort of infers that full markup (beyond the gitter markup) is supported https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200176682-markdown-basics  --i can\\'t find the secret welcome @rjshaver  i suppose i could always just do a screenshot of text if i wanted to guarantee indentation retention  thanks myself (no camperbot, i can\\'t thank myself) lol what do nerds do on saturday? (nvm) lol camperbot is really eager to contribute i wonder if the distinction relates to the early implementations of js (i.e., it was for all intents and purposes bound to browsers (yes, there\\'s was actionscript, blah..blah) i\\'m convinced its early implementation was environment based relating to \\'no classes\\'  where\\'s the sandwich, again? also, there\\'s new functionality...if you\\'re on a bonfire page and click chat.... you\\'re taken to the applicable help you know the discussion (no classes in javascript  comes up a lot (whether you\\'re on the semantic or non-semantic side of argument)... i wonder if this would be a good tech interview question to be able to explain  i\\'m guessing so too (never good in that (interview) situation to be buh, buh, buh,\\'ng  your lips ) lol great more cra^ on the list (belated) hi, @slofty  @vaghawan what kind of issue are you experiencing ? @vaghawan aside from your question, you might want to change the message location (i.e., the one that says \\'you\\'ve clicked (n) button)... it covers the buttons you\\'re supposed to select. (is that prompting your question?) are you trying to clone? hi @khurramn  trying to catch up on caffeine  i run linux, but maybe this https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/484 has something to do with the slow... issue (don\\'t have any ideas about the specs etc., so, just a guess) .btn-trigger vs. *.btn-triger* maybe? @jdieter12  there is *only one* web dev position in your geographical area? (problem we should have lol) @scissors61 , you might have to do some intermediate (pre-processing steps) https://gist.github.com/faisalman/4213592 -  this will get you to hex, then it\\'s up to you that sucks howdy @cuent  @amodsureka good luck!  batperson @shifthawke be really careful with cpu..... if upgrading (e.g., on a board that supports better)... cpu is not forgiving... (gpu not as bad) i\\'ve had good luck with corsair welcome @fauker , @nikhataly  human responses trump bots any day bob i think that voids warranty  works great (only thing (not that it matters) the \\'you think too much\\' static part creates a \\'text on text\\' presentation, that makes it hard to read)  http://www.regexr.com/ - https://regex101.com brad hamilton: (regex) right. learn it. know it. live it. good fun @pong324 advice that\\'s probably not going to go anywhere: @shifthawke is building a gaming rig really? i.e.., really? to the duckett book well, i guess break dancing while holding a duckett book is out of the question yeah it sucks now what? @anant1271 i would change to the font color on \\'novice coder\\' to something else (too close in range to the background image)....(and probably just as a style thing never refer to your own work (even indirectly) as simplistic.... other than that love the look! (sorry the hyperlink (default blue) i meant is close in range....(so maybe the image, oh...nvm) @anant1271 , if you\\'re viewing in a larger screen (non mobile), there\\'s no intuitive way to navigate once you\\'ve made a selection from navbar (you\\'re taken to middle of page, but then have to scroll-home) i think so, @psykobilliethekid , i noticed a new hour indicator (last few days to week) next to the sections and there is a new (wp, bonfire, zip...etc.) context specific chat feature. avatar - a new romance. (wait, somebody already took that title) lol you can in your browser (copy paste) or you can use other tools @rarezik , the bonfires are (can be) challenging... it sort of marks the point where\\'s there\\'s less hand holding. there\\'s a a help room if you get stuck what are you invoking again? just don\\'t invoke \\'the bot\\' rhymes with camperbot don\\'t do it @storbeck are you really going to start blogging (i saw the question earlier about medium)? (nice (s)css animation btw) imo sounds like a bad idea @nickysavage  no boot camp (charging any amount) is going to give you that @nickysavage ... and you can hang with fellow nerds what is it nerd pretending to be a geek shrouded in a metaphor?  gerken gerken\\'stein lots of arrays (see a trend ?) @travishi  those are tasty with pasta don\\'t let @travishi fool you @shifthawke .... it\\'s simply a pasta booster  noooooooooo sigh hiya @francisngo  bye @nickysavage  @shifthawke  did it turn frickin cold where you are? sucks ? https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ wow, it is pretty reasonable (<--hopes that i\\'m not getting sucked into some sort of promotional thing) i looked at the pricing plan on individual... doesn\\'t look too bad wow there\\'s a node.js room it does that the gitter sign in integration with fcc on mobile works a little too well i\\'m thinking the question/response time (here) is going to be what interplanetary gitter will be like (once we get around to landing on mars) lol  matt damon\\'s character\\'s issues stemmed from starring repos  oh, great... now i\\'m on a nerd quest... (what is the radio signal delay between earth and mars ) ? http://blogs.esa.int/mex/2012/08/05/time-delay-between-mars-and-earth/ @arielleslie that\\'s in the ballpark. i haven\\'t seen movie. is it any good? or pulling lol i\\'d be interested in the technical elements... but on the human story side, i wonder if it\\'s a mars version of castaway @demetrig it hangs on loading googleanalytics (and like @kirah1314 states, there\\'s an alert in js) if it hangs in pen view, i\\'m not loading the full view @demetrig, using jquery might be easier... your issue is with the button itself (your quotes, are sound (in fact, they will display on load)...  hey @medi86  most people keep a reference handy some js videos (on youtube) are actually good...\\'only functions have scope\\' (es5)... i was wondering why i see trees of functions are you getting an error message? @steph88  huh, are you blocking js with an extension? (i know @jbmartinez asked this) firefox has the best dev tools  i use chrome (chromium) and ff doh, beat me to it... (firebug) also, there\\'s also an ide tool that you can make projects with different runtimes (e.g., the ff mobile (think sizing), and browser) just... caution as the projects are particular about external stuff there are also (and this is not exclusive to ff) json viewers (this will come in handy later) yeah, i broke from the \\'extension\\' category for a moment there @jbmartinez lol @steph88  is the issue re: not being able to complete the exercise, still active/happening? actually, you know @jbmartinez had a point earlier about antivirus programs (windows)... sometimes they install extensions into the browser itself another windows \\'gem\\' (although, in this case it\\'s the antivirus co.... but points back to windows either way) lol thanks for the links @iheartkode , @0x0936  rock on, @jnandez1986  welcome @z30136  how is your maxpart var not throwing an error? @arielleslie , didn\\'t see an accompanying array var matching the argument the three dots throw an error of unexpected token.... (i can see math.max(arr); working)... in both console... and running node (sorry for the side, convo/distraction) .. (i\\'m talking about the literal argument in op\\'s code sample)... i\\'ll look this up for edification purposes (for me that is) @giraffeattack , i\\'m on the fence about setting flag (which i heard about recently) to es6 in node except the exercises may not support it (i don\\'t know this for sure)... hence, i stay closer to \\'vanilla\\' js when doing these awsome. welcome @mikealbo  i found the opposite to be true (i.e., gitter totally flakes after awhile) i think it\\'s all the embedded media/code (gitter wise) that requires need to refresh page occasionally   you can learn code at any point in your life that depends on you (i\\'m not a fortune cookie bot - i promise) sup @iheartkode  yeah, was going to say https://repl.it/languages/javascript (but i use node locally) @kimkwanka that\\'s pretty sharp fearful coding? sounds like a game show idea tons of questions is good except firebase lol they have one: crashed browser lol (yes agree too) unless you\\'re working on a very large file (which js would probably be wrong tool in first place), if your code hasn\\'t finished executing <1min (even less so, really) there\\'s a problem @iheartkode sounds like a good project... like a pre-step to actually running the code  sorry < 1 min grrr looks like ibm has sort of the idea about catching js infinite loops in their services: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssfpjs_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tadm_javascript_loops.html @xeoneux i agree, it should be a matter of seconds then terminate process.... day here or late afternoon i\\'m convinced that deep frying adds flavor to anything you can try deep frying water @ukchukx ; however, the reaction might not be what you expect (disclaimer: never put water near hot oil... it will splatter/burn) well, @ukchukx there\\'s tang, crystal lite, etc.,  i\\'m digging the ravioli in that link welcome @lucidruss  at first glance i thought screen-name was the rapper  very nice, @powerjohn  congrats! regex is useful for a lot of stuff you can strip out whatever chars (e.g., like you state sanitizing) you like (for example formatting phone # s) but regex is much more powerful than that it\\'s wicked useful (and language agnostic) http://www.regexr.com/ -and -  https://regex101.com np :smile:  yes, there are different flags (for example in bash scripting) but it is the same concept across all languages when i speak about regex, i feel as though i\\'m quoting darth vader \"you don\\'t know the power of the dark side\" darth vader? i still have to update node (have a really stale ubuntu repo version) i\\'d have to apt-cache policy it.... but ubuntu, (depending on release type) is not a rolling distro why i should have just installed from .deb in first place yes, mint is a rolling distro (and is a derivative of deb/ubuntu)... but ubuntu itself ism isn\\'t rolling releases, kind of scare me i tend towards the lts versions (stability -- but there\\'s a compromise there) but can always through the \\'bleeding edge\\' stuff in a vm and experiment through = throw i used mint a few years back... not a bad distro yeah, i can understand that.... i use kde (with ubuntu) and sometimes fallback to gnome or mate desktop.... but kde really has grown into my workflow heya @lukeghenco  @recodeexistance isn\\'t that slot supposed to be enclosed in brackets? ```\\n//let\\'s use the jquery selector $(\".slot\") to select all of the slots.\\n//\\n//once they are all selected, we can use bracket notation to access each individual slot:\\n//\\n//$($(\".slot\")[0]).html(slotone);\\n\\n//=========^\\n``` gitter reformatted my caret i don\\'t know if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for....  is the chat (i.e., integration with gitter) option in fcc homepage navbar down? welcome @prasannaramamoorthy  weak type throws me (especially when i see \\'on-the-fly variables\\') totally valid... but have to wrap mind around sometimes @lifeburner js might actually concatenate that as a string operation as 420 yeah, but you\\'d go broke if you had a checkout total that = 420 vs. 24 don\\'t fear it (js) if you understand it (which i\\'m still on journey)... it\\'s really powerful like assembly? sure, but isn\\'t there a distinction between levels of abstraction? haven\\'t heard of this programming ritual of which you speak (mine is pretty limited to coffee and some sugar laden thing) actually, my first introduction was a slight variant in a metallica song in the late 80\\'s  so, not completely wasted  ^yep why power over memory management is good and bad jumping to c a little here <-- has to actually finish \\'c\\' book oh, no i\\'m sure there\\'s some nerd behavior study in progress well, if it\\'s in progress... i\\'m sure i\\'ve been included in the nerd sample no, that would infinitely summon @lifeburner  you will get a runtime error @arielleslie is total nerd (so i\\'m guesing \\'the no love for geeks\\' is not applicable) lol @rselover , your resolve will be tested when you \\'meet the bonfires\\' the initial lessons (imo) are a way to transition to the actual programming stuff...

(i.e., a cable that\\'s faster than what can be transmitted (or received/processed) between say an external drive and another machine)...  i don\\'t think usb type-c has even had a chance to be adopted (as an aside lol) great i login to gitter and get a \\'c:\\\\\\' prompt lol it\\'s kind of like a frame/guide (imo) here\\'s the general stuff you need to learn, here\\'s some general examples... now go research/repeat (so, yeah get out of it what you put in) i\\'m just here for the memes and chicken fries lol @shifthawke  i would answer but this animated gif is distracting me it\\'s hypnotic amazon should use that just to go back (a ways) i agree, @shifthawke new batwoman , not so great might be artificial intelligence  i\\'m pretty sure the pope is not fighting street crime himself (well, there\\'s the chance...oh, nvm lightening i\\'m sure will strike) i must say, those are some serious meme chops there ok, i\\'m going to try to stop laughing now i\\'m sure the next pc mag article will use this snapshot in time as their next screenshot of gitter (for article) you\\'re jumping back and forth between java and javascript? how does your head not explode? there are still a lot of .net shops on the surface i\\'d agree... but i think there\\'s a distinct philosophy with js that can\\'t be wrapped in the construct of other things are you running reporting stuff through java? there\\'s a lot reporting stuff that uses java.... (think jaspersoft) nice, @crisberrios  sounds like a great gig sure there are still a lot of scenarios where a sql server backend with some sort of java reporting layer (or if you must ssrs) makes sense in some applications...... wait, you lost me.... is this aarp coding (not that it can\\'t be, or there\\'s anything wrong with that) ? you never want to see a horse make that face, trust me  if you\\'re freelancing, you have to have a lot of executive level skills (apart from programming) ^ that\\'s interesting, one thing that i think is missed is you\\'re not necessarily going to have creative control over things ... you may be part of a dev team or... there will be specs by client.. (so, you\\'re not always going to be in creative xanadu land) tech isn\\'t just limited to creative mobile apps or snazzy this, snazzy that.... there\\'s a lot of \\'boring\\' (which isn\\'t so boring) that keeps companies/orgs churning along in their respective missions yeah, i tried for the \\'killer app\\' by way of the deep fried squid timer for mobile... didn\\'t work out like a tazer phone?  that is totally a great app idea or taser i like the deep fried squid timer better but that\\'s just me welcome @cannelflow  yes, \\'rm\\' in bash is a bad thing when not used correctly (or worse yet, with admin privs) there you go @lifeburner yes, i\\'ll get right on that starting with /  lol pigs in space! totally i was just thinking that how wrong is that? they were an unlikely pair... kermit was so reserved and miss piggy was a total diva...

(i.e., its \\'profile\\' raised) oh, i just caught the logic (i.e., it\\'s a scrape of chat profiles)... i was wondering out of huge userbase you could get leaderboard stats like that.... (it\\'s cool though, no doubt) i feel less bad now (i\\'m 126999th out of 127000) ty, ty but what if my question is: \"do you have the three piece meal in extra crispy\"?  (am i still the answer?) sorry, i\\'m usually \\'all about the deep quotes\\'; however, being 126999th out of 127000 on the leaderboard is bumming me out lol you didn\\'t see it ? (i\\'m just kidding a bit, it\\'s based on chat scapes so the sample isn\\'t that big) it\\'s a neat project that somebody created @dting just posted (a link of) it.... here\\'s the link http://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/ there\\'s a lot of neat stuff (ton of resources) that you can learn in the curriculum and community (just a free plug unrelated to anything) it happens i don\\'t think you have to spend a huge amount for sound card (unless you\\'re doing some serious media server thing) @shifthawke browser newegg browse grrrr i can\\'t type/spell sha na na @dting , yeah i looked at the bottom of the board... (because i was trying to wrap my mind around how you could rank a huge sample etc., then noted that the sample was limited to stats within active participants in chat) it\\'s a neat idea (makes me want to sort of look into gitter api.... (i see a lot of different stats being pulled for different experiments....) browse the newegg, browse the newegg ( @shifthawke ) or not look at the reviews @shifthawke  (yeah, you have to go through each etc) but they\\'re starred a new version of application has been deployed click here to reload.....

(have been for awhile... it might stay) @darrylpargeter i\\'ve heard that (keyboard only input (with shortcuts) ) is wicked fast @darrylpargeter total.  lol use nano on the fly but nothing heavy  do those mac shortcuts work on a linux system (they\\'re kinda sorta in the same *nix universe )? like theseus in brackets?  has neat benchmarking stuff @recodeexistance testing what you created (i.e., benchmarking, performance.. execution, blah..blah) is not a bad thing, that\\'s good. @quincylarson , i saw the new blog (medium) link/email... is fcc still going to continue the site specific one? (i.e., on the site itself)? @shifthawke you\\'re doing some blogging? nice. i\\'m not sure i could be interesting enough, to blog on a regular basis @flailgull did you fork camperbot? lol but do you have to blog on a consistent basis? what about people that got cobol tattoos  if anything, it would be a perl one lol @earthtone0ne nice, be bold: pascal with lots of dragons and stuff is a clear winner everybody feels that way (not just limited to programming/design) agree. it\\'s so easy to let *you* talk you out of something (endeavor, etc.,) we really are, are own worst critics. great i sound like anthony robbins  lol ^ two posts before that is like aliens i\\'m guessing that the question is because \\'entitled\\' in attitude is sort of incongruent with impostor syndrome (that is to say you\\'d have to have a certain amount of mental maturity to doubt yourself in the first place)  by the way.... i read an article that places \\'natural language\\' skills ahead of mathematics in terms of what may makes a good programmer, a good programmer... thought it was interesting don\\'t know anything (relative to any stream in progress) but, i\\'ve experienced (as a viewer) a lot of buffering/drops in twitch welcome @kastentx  what\\'s the obs (software) experience like on twitch? (if used) @lifeburner looks like there\\'s 3rd party tools/approaches to download streams for twitch (haven\\'t used any of (those)...for local playback my *guess* would be: no.... typically, it\\'s kind of analogous to wget can\\'t recommend without using (in the case of twitch)... but there\\'s a lot of google stuff @rodri0315 the recursion (attempted) just calls itself until you have  maximum call stack exceeded correct me if i\\'m wrong @storbeck but @mindfulbell this part: \\'settimeout(function(title, snippet)\\' is important to the scoping \\'function(title, snippet) within settimeout yes, welcome @sabahang  if you look at some of the twitch blogs, the dropping stream isn\\'t isolated  what was the topic (section) of your stream, @akiralaine ? nice i\\'d watch that (if i could lol) but, that\\'s the same problem i\\'ve had with all twitch streams yeah, the \\'live\\' aspect isn\\'t a deal breaker (in fact video editing imo makes for a more streamlined production) @akiralaine  nice... welcome, @neliusknight  so, @coltonehrman keep seeing the same link scrolling by... can you provide some context to the link(s)? hey, i want a js conference badge you can forget stuff that you did over and over though...  if it was long ago that\\'s actual eye twitching (rem sleep) 250,000 oh, wait... it\\'s \\'how would you go about solving this?\\' doh it was just a guess (i didn\\'t use the coveted problem solving pattern technique) @rodri0315 that will fry the stack golf balls are cool that would be my answer programming is awesome no doubt... but don\\'t idealize it (i.e., barrels of money, total and complete happiness, etc.) -- it begins to sound like a trucking school commercial  lol do the waypoints you will get a ton of javascript (good stuff) i totally underestimated js oh, no i\\'m among designers lol i was wondering what that weird feeling was totally, (although it\\'s hard to argue against the neat stuff i see in scss) have seen some interesting demos that don\\'t even have any js... what\\'s that thing growing out of his neck? nvm lol first rule in motivational speechs: never have eels growing out of your neck (it distracts from point/message) i\\'m afraid i\\'ll turn to stone with medusa neck what\\'s the genesis (meme wise) of this motivational thing? (<--- has no issues with medusa... or serpent challenged people) no, not phil collins i never understood phil collins  i can admit that peter gabriel\\'s music wasn\\'t bad..... in comparison..... (when the universe is defined as late 80s contemporary) not my fav genre  all of the research that went into the realization of the internet... and i\\'m talking about phil collins yep lol you\\'re reading the phil collins bio i know doing a search within pen returns results, but there\\'s no mechanism to access the articles hiya @antoniohoyen  wow, look at @abhisekp \\'s current brownie count thanks @abhisekp  ah, better lol no, i added an extra brownie point to get rid of that \\'palindrome\\' :smile:  nice @mindfulbell , the return results now have links now put some gigantic cats with lightening coming out of their eyes... and you\\'re all set i see where you applied @hermanfassett \\'s, suggested, change (beginning on line 77) looks good you might want to add more context to the overall project (also, see the other forum posts) with lightening and stuff is the project (website) the same as what\\'s in github? (i.e., there\\'s one with a similar name) i like the intro.js that\\'s neat.... is that what was used in one of the prior fcc iterations? you could even add a polling feature to rank the results @allanarmstrong = team treehouse shill lol that\\'s always nice honestly though, there\\'s a cra* load of free resources here (and \\'out there\\') a lot of mobile apps use that model... (but if your free app is so limited that it sucks, i\\'m not even getting to the paid version) the timing of their java offering threw me as well... (i was like, now? weird) yep not if you\\'re referencing an external font... but i think user agent does pair with what\\'s on machine in the latter fonts are pretty so is mine a lot of programs (including browsers) reference what\\'s on the machine itself in terms of fonts (again, when you\\'re not referencing an external (like google) font) english but how do you know about jquery and json, then? welcome @usernamewastaken  @usernamewastaken the curriculum is challenging, and the community is great @usernamewastaken , i\\'d say that (while there are many) this (community) is what sets fcc apart voice commands on mobile text to speech can return really unexpected results try saying gitter to your phone  see what get you that\\'s what those paid bootcamps do. i agree that it\\'s not likely to be able pickup knowlege like that hiya @jelena212  i somtimes feel the same way hi @nprayder  i dont like the popups it would be neat to taper the \\'way to go aspects\\' as you progress visual studio is microsoft though nice. there\\'s also an extension for brackets that does the same sublime is fast (i\\'ll give it that) but i\\'m not sure i like it i think brackets will be a keeper (been evaluating it for a while) yeah that\\'s pretty cool. there\\'s also a node package that does the same preview. haven\\'t installed it yet java slow why not stay in law school and learn to code. you could do patent law for tech industries  you might want to review scoping. global variables can (yes it\\'s contextual) complicate things gitter in mobile so fun hiya @asc1783  what i love is there\\'s standardization (ecma) but variance by browser scripting engine.  noooo lol i\\'m making s new browser called  rupecht (my new browser) js engine will be eye patch but there was a show called sha na na bowser was the lead character.  if use that in place of browser there might be copyright infrig thats what iheart radio thought with pre 1970s sings songs i\\'m on mobile your plan needs work beyond on screen keys lol https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jon_bauman that would be the fly in ointment to your otherwise stellar plan the errant \"z\" will make no difference. lol ok only if you want to make the sha na na singer a dominant force ((google, apple, ha) in tech did test actually pass? (or was/is there output indicating otherwise?) that\\'s really a java platform with new js  sprinkled (recently) over. probably won\\'t get a lot if feedback netbeans rhat is grrr mobile. rhat = that welcome @andrii-skliar  what i wouldn\\'t give for decent text-to-speech (versus mediocre) for basic testing,  i have found running node on a file (or interactively) to be great good success story. i like the hard work and dedication aspect (which i think is sometimes missed) @codenonprofit is fcc going to retain blog or is everything transitioning to medium? (or both) heya @yoga30696  quara has a lot of neat fcc related questions/answers he gives pretty thoughtful answers there (and on blogs) that\\'s a neat level of accesability that (account) aspect is a pain no doubt. (have to agree gitter mobile sucks ok i feel better camperbot may be soulless but the jury is still out on sentient  i see a lot of string conversion with regard to formatting of dates i feel like i\\'m being followed by arrays (bonfire side effect) i\\'m going to use that with meetings @phajava (i\\'m here but my mind may not be) caffeine (if delivered via tasty coffee) rules yeah just any related links  coffee is love camperbot is not bad in comparison to twitch yeah but that\\'s relative. overly advanced stuff could be discouraging  gitter lag i login and get dance party i\\'m dance challenged (to put it mildly ) lol @ayzeeba codecademy\\'s basic js course isn\\'t that great (in fact, many here have done it too (it used to be part of curriculum before homegrown stuff ) js is misunderstood (imo) and is more powerful than it lets on. (this is what i\\'m finding) it kind of borrowed everybody\\'s clothing i think that has more to do with transition dynamics for course intro @ayzeeba you will get plenty o plenty barebones js here  anybody having any issues with \\'dead functionality\\' on chat link in fcc homepage nav?  what\\'s your question @thec0mposer ? you can perform a join in select (and other types, but let\\'s do this for now) on other column names (from other tables) without knowing keys etc. (this helps; however, pk/fk relates to entity relationships ( e.g., you couldn\\'t add transmission data to a table unless there was a parent car record in another... hope that makes sense) @thec0mposer you may want to review (inner) joins http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp\\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3536283/how-to-join-two-tables-mysql @nightvinyl (imo (and i\\'m not an expert), i would say that javascript is very important (even beyond the curriculum) ) @lhm0700 make sure to close quotes help formatting is that the correct id name (based on the instructions)? my (implicit) point was to read the instructions carefully (as the the id name might be different) wait, a minute... wasn\\'t the \\'dark smurf\\' smurfette? lol  yeah, i\\'m reaching back in my memory > 20 years but smurfette was created by some evil wizard so    he could capture the smurfs welcome @saatishq  ^ so, true gitter fcc (...) is worse than nicotine: it should come with a label bottom section relates to repo activity  (fcc itself is a project) noooo @saintpeter lol btw i read your quara quora  grrrr i can spell, i promise i\\'ve seen some pretty neat implementations (various pen examples) of using geo, then ip for fallback i totally guessed you would, @kimkwanka  @kimkwanka , because this isn\\'t your first rodeo (your code examples are neat) you can also run node on yourfile.js (my favorite) i am but just switched to mobile  what\\'s q? trying to add fk yes? i love that you\\'re learning relational db i\\'ve always wondered (yes, those examples are correct for op) why an outer div with col-xs-4 is not applied to the inner elements  http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html take off button before period  .someclass { }; nvm i missed the question at the bottom yes, never eat potted meat @96street are you running this in an exercise or independently? (if so, you will need to reference bootstrap -the latter) help formatting learn regex @jonnps : it rocks wow gitter mobile is doing weird stuff with code formatting  gigantica font are you testing with various target devices grid systems are evil or semi-evil no i say that in (semi) jest @96street  there are still websites out there that are completely un-responsive.... i\\'m like sheesh, get with it  but that\\'s the whole point (i guess really) it\\'s harder and harder to develop solely for desktop... (why would that be your aim.... unless it\\'s some sort of complicated saas app)? pretty broad question... what are your end-goals for learning? howdy @hbourlan  @renatobispo , you benefit from diversifying your learning materials (and it\\'s implicit in approach in course) yeah, i started with codecademy long before fcc.... i wish fcc was around then codecademy has some good stuff; however, some of their material has a lot of logic gaps or appears to written by a team of contributors that never actually talked to each other  which reminds me i have to finish their (codecademy) angular course lol which courses, @mahfouzer ? yeah, their (codecademy) basic js is pretty bad you\\'re being kind @iheartkode lol hiya @neuralneurosis  rock on, @kylebiancardi ! @mahfouzer do the fcc js courses have you mastered js, @mahfouzer ? yeah, i\\'m tempted to learn ruby so, do the fcc javascript stuff (it will get you closer) @mahfouzer .... (i\\'m not bs\\'ng you) @iheartkode when i complete (this) i\\'m probably going to check out ruby (after perl lol) lol well, i do love linux @teejayparker barfing while coding is bad formula yes, it\\'s called bwitterlisp @kimkwanka  inkscape rocks (not just for svg) lol  you can do all kinds of layout in inkscape draw svg over bitmaps, (bunch of other stuff... i use it even for non-web applications... (there are terminal commands etc., exports in a lot of formats) it\\'s bada^^ sounds like fried pork skins @iheartkode have you worked with dynamic svg (drawing) ? (i\\'ve seen references, looks kind of interesting) kind of in a canvas context yeah, constructors suck lol do you limit the number of chars in your quote string, @osterbergmarcus ? @osterbergmarcus what are you trying to escape in your regex (where you\\'re concatenating url with....) ? @osterbergmarcus try: qtext.replace(/\\\\s%20/g,\\' \\')\\'\"); @kimkwanka being down to your last cig is good and bad (mostly bad... ) when you wake... you\\'re going to be like...\"wtf is my cig (in this case \\'where\\') lol @qmikew1 no it\\'s not lol @osterbergmarcus the pen is timing out on me.. but i think the issue is you\\'re not passing the concatenated value.... you\\'re passing the literal replace regex statement (wrong) ... does that make sense? bye @kimkwanka  #i am font, bwah ha, ha there you go but it\\'s \\'1/2 tag\\'  like i thought you would enclose the hash(s) no, it only accommodates \\'gitter markup\\' ramen is flavored with things too not sure if they\\'re organic in all cases your takeover of the universe has some holes it\\'s telling you to use brackets @iheartkode then you know why atom is at a loss for words  lol cue lightsaber sound nvm cue lightsaber sound again, (php @iheartkode ) lol did i just see an eggplant  i really want eggplant now, t h a nks  ah mobile again gitter mobile you must really want to learn angular  a for effort have you considered codescool , codecademy again i am on mobile grammar police camperbot is time-zone free if you don\\'t love (or finding yourself loving) to problem solve, coding may not be nirvana for some (that may be what op is kind of getting at idk) help formatting the best (or a) way is to paste your code and describe issue that you\\'re experiencing (you multiply your chances of getting help) i\\'m pretty sure i woke up this am, because i wanted coffee sad or you could paste your code not you @alayek  the  actual code that is not passing, (this was the point of help formatting invocation) this way it\\'s easier for folks to troubleshoot issues / help people camperbot is love (turns head) yes, it does things based on regex and direct commands etc.,  hiya @ignorantusguru  welcome hiya @dukeyu2011 , @samanehg  not bad, waking up slowly @khurramn was your question answered? welcome @viktorzo  focus on the coding part, first. (start with the exercises) @ignorantusguru  coffee woke me up like from slumber are you talking about environment paths? i ask because, i recall someone having an issue running both a 32bit and 64bit version(s) probably not applicable nvm more coffee, that is the answer for everything i was just going through nginx docs you\\'re totally right about heroku lol the documentation is not \\'hand holding\\' by any measure @prashcr are you running a server from your own hardware? (or deployed on something like aws) welcome @pavanp73  hi @galz28  @akiralaine are you going to take another try at twitch? not a good time to do bonfire, check lol got it. i usually work through invoking node on a local js file (so, my procrastination excuse isn\\'t very good) hiya @kofiakorli  imo you should approach it sequentially (go through all the js based bf) before taking on angular @benmcmahon100 is 2.0 going to break stuff? there are some days i wish i used a blackberry again lol it provides coherent insight (of course not every possible approach ) to dev  there\\'s also a community dynamic that sets this (fcc) apart... great community and there is an inclusiveness that seems to be communicated in the project itself. so, to me there\\'s kind of a stakeholder feeling (not sure how to articulate this) that comes accross now i have the entire album rotating in head weird you should mention floyd, watched a documentary the other day  i think there was a restart on the site about an hour ago (could be side effect idk) yeah, refresh should do it oh, i totally didn\\'t get that medium actually integrates into site itself.  hi @g2musicgroup  cats are the internet overlords bot tax mobile and sticking to monosyllabic responses  where\\'s the pen (can give a mobile responsive perspective (if anything while on mobile)) i wonder if apple purposely messes with chrome.  good assumption, same here weather forecast totally off 70s my... there\\'s this weird lag (device independent) in gitter that i can\\'t put my finger (on) linux/chrome when not on mobile chromium that is subtle ie sucks on so many levels that definitely a motivator: the average consumer (be it content, apps, etc.) has very little patience for non-performant stuff that\\'s welcome @aanjan91  no (and unrelated, there\\'s a refresh issue on the mobile side) wow, interesting scroll. i agree with darksmurf  heya nice. @darksmurf  so, you can use (those) offline i\\'ve gone over this before... the \\'dark smurf\\' is smurfette. wikipedia: * she was created by gargamel, the smurfs\\' enemy, in order to distract and trap them; however, later she was rescued by papa smurf and turned into a real smurf. *  lol sudo rm / sudo rm / -r lol it\\'s a beer from colarado  (so they say) while, indeed cra***, i\\'ve never seen such a strong opinion about it you\\'re interfering with \\'basking in the timestamp\\' functionality @abhisekp   lol looks good @dsenza (and it also, looks like you\\'ve handled string len as well) does codepen add extra stuff hiya @rusty4077  hell world i am ruphrect. i wanting to learn code so i can on day hv own avacado tree oh like that hello world welcome @rockie667  i can\\'t remember, but i\\'m pretty sure that i came up with some variant of \\'h e ll o world\\' because i felt sort of silly (so we all have the feeling.... welcome!) your argument needs to be a string lol i think i first saw fcc on a lifehaker feedly lifehacker yeah i think there\\'s a date joined in homepage  you could pair that with the archives (am i getting this right)?  a lot were pruned (i think) due to lack of activity there should be a dimension guideline for camperbot\\'s wiki invocation... i was wondering the same, he really knows his stuff once you visit the room (help with bonfires etc., etc.) you\\'ll have it in \\'favs\\' (side panel) for easy reference/access but there\\'s also the contextual (which isn\\'t working for me all of the sudden) feature if you\\'re in a bonfire and click chat it will take you to the relevant room use mdn why? @canemunster (it might be good to provide feedback) mine was delivered to me via feedly i was like nice... gotta check this out welcome @jamaldt  lord vader? so, not lord vader? drats lol @dillonklein that bigger + button throws off the uniform row thing in the grid the only thing i could  come up with is (will paste in a second... but you may want to get other input.....)\\n ```\\n.btnplus{\\n  height:80px;\\n margin-bottom:-50px;\\n}\\n``` <---waits for the onslaught of responsiveness criticism  camperbot it will be ok, they love you (really) i\\'m sure camperbot at the end of the day says \"those ungrateful bas****\" lol @abhisekp has an invocation re: animated gifs explain gifs nope that\\'s not it omg what did you do lol any character from back to the future is like a religious level of being what\\'s next, will you graffiti the delorean lol  i think the telepathic nature is somewhat watered down with text firefox should be leading the chant (yes chrome is faster but,) so they just left the comment? oh, that\\'s fun to trace yeah, like remap \\'what values\"? might be nice but that would be too easy <---thinks initnotification may effect @arielleslie \\'s normal patient responses  affect grrr gitter is it too much to ask, oh nvm i love how chrome\\'s request desktop view requires a hard reset to undo help formatting those aren\\'t bacticks hi repl.it wow that keeps happening lol so like find within a large string? (multiples) yeah (n) number of palindromes @abhisekp \\'s proposal oh numeric pals it\\'s around 2am -  took me a moment too latr see? late they need to fix their request desktop view functionally  welcome @nalipp  i wonder if an introduction to camperot grrr mobile should be included (in terms of invoking its wiki)  bring back blackberry! ok i feel better repl.it needs to work on their mobile interface i\\'m just here to watch the real time markup if aliens (far across galaxy) code, what is the closest lang that we have that they would use (casio keyboard idea taken already) hmmm you told potential emp that you\\'re not familiar with their setup, right? download ubuntu if you want to familiarize yourself with *nix based approach i\\'m just saying if on your first day you\\'re looking at a mac like a caveman would look at a toaster might leave bad impression.  i feel ya @justinunderhill i\\'m not a mac fan (use linux) it will workout @justinunderhill  it\\'s assumed if you\\'re a dev you know cli  np @justinunderhill. you will figure it out (really, it\\'s just pre-nerves) except you won\\'t be eating watery oatmeal  lol oatmeal juice no clue i want oatmeal now i\\'m at the magic hour (nothing open) where i can go to some distant outpost for oatmeal  good luck @justinunderhill  the mac topic got me thinking. don\\'t let hardware be an impediment to dev aspirations: a lot of linux distros can turn even the oldest hardware into a good rig why not just stick with external editor ? that\\'s really diverse skill set (persian rugs + web dev) welcome @ngonnella  you\\'ll do fine (eye for detail is most applicable to coding) there\\'s also content (in addition to methods) i think marketing people are secure in their jobs with @allanarmstrong  it has a ring though  nook noooo i love auto correct votivevote (adds soft touch ) yeah gitter is not productive you\\'ll find your own productively groove  the best part of the crockford page is the pattern summary at bottom (public/private, etc) another thing to add to list (sign up for pen (while it\\'s still non-pro option(able)) are the main differences pretty much \\'private option\\' & collaboration tools? (pro vs. non) i think you\\'re right about that @storbeck , look at the pens tagged with \\'free code camp\\' you see a lot of pro featured users built-in resources... (sounds better and better) (assets) do you just take a laptop or pad, and login and show prospective clients your work? (i.e., kind of hand device over for a minute)  do both the link idea (to actual pen) is a good idea too it\\'s good to be poached -in the talent sense -- (congratulations)  not in the cooking sense lol it\\'s hard to gauge project scope ( over the lifetime of endeavor) sometimes.  (especially if there isn\\'t a strong project management ethos) totally... as well as scope directive-direction (hey i just made a new word) agreed. i think there is more acceptance of that where the product/service itself is tech related... or in cases where a very large budget is allocated (then, ba is a total must and can\\'t be ignored ) ok, where\\'s the six sigma waypoint? or scrum bonfire lol you would need a backend database sql (mysql, postgresql, sql server) or no-sql (mongodb, or others) don\\'t use access as a web based database json will be in the no-sql category btw there\\'s a mongodb portion of curriculum (although, you\\'ll get different opinions about mongo) as a production asset  i think the scenario sound more like a local project you can grant certain ip address access in *nix (and other systems) unix (linux , bsd,  mac (to a certain degree) it\\'s unix like... is the main idea will do @quincylarson  @takumar yeah, i loved that part.. as well as the cheeto covered desk and the screen saver (the guy from seinfeld in jurassic park) there are at least 4 links in that zipline... which one? oh, nvm  that link lol yep (and looks interesting)  i see how this is going to go now... i finish said section, and more stuff is added.. then i finish said section... lol could functionality (akin to the t-shirt campaign) that has (n) number of items were added to curriculum - click here to hide forever type thing... be added? lay it on us @progmacattack  very nice... but where\\'s the score? worked for me .... it\\'s pretty neat... (only thing is the score i\\'m totally not trying to be nit picky) lots of great logic np  oooh let me try that mode but that gives it character....  remember the old video games? they had all kinds of issues.... i could drive off tracks that didn\\'t exist if you really want to shake it up.... have multiple tic tac boards all going at the same time yeah it\\'s monster tic tac toe (the auto restart is a nice touch) tic-tac-chipotle just seeing camperbot\\'s smile is enough for me i\\'m too caught up in the glow to be insulted lkl or lol as some might say the gitter emotes, don\\'t render consistently for me any longer (weird)\\n\\n\\n where\\'s set1 array coming from? yes, i got that part lol  help formatting i now see why you didn\\'t give set1 array details goat? lol lol @iheartkode  are you accounting for zero based index (s1 starts at 0 (good)) in comparison with length? @iheartkode  i dunno, i\\'d have to agree about re-write  @iheartkode you have 8 items in your array ... if loop is based on < len won\\'t you only get 7 ? starting from 0 based index you\\'re right on @iheartkode suggestion, @groundxaero  (index wise, button threw through me off) \\n grrr ```\\nvar set1 = [\"item1\",\"item2\",\"item3\",\"item4\", \"item5\",\"item6\",\"item7\",\"item8\"];\\n\\nset1pos = 0;\\nfor (i=0; i < set1.length; i++){\\n    //artificial loop to emulate button clicks\\n\\n\\nif (set1pos < set1.length){\\n    console.log (set1[set1pos]);\\n    //do some jquery text \\n    set1pos++;\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\n``` will you be pairing cheese burgers with jd for your selection? sarcasm brownie points are the best yes, knowing camperbot\\'s regex \\'th a n ks\\' triggers is good when you don\\'t want it (camperbot) butting into your comment with \\'if you want to ....th a nk someone\\' do this... select it? chat is context specific... if you open it from map... you get general chat... if you open it from bonfire it opens in bonfire etc.,  (although there were some changes so, don\\'t know now) i don\\'t think it\\'s specific to the exact bonfire... but help with bonfire in general gitter desktop, isn\\'t great (doesn\\'t offer anything over browser based (in fact, it\\'s less featured)) @iheartkode i want to see the project when it\\'s finished lol @solineoz to each her/his own.... i\\'ve run it (gitter desktop)  on linux and found it to be lacking @solineoz i kept wondering \"where\\'s the extra functionality\"? almost makes me wonder if there\\'s a hidden feature set for pro-users (paid gitter teams) @solineoz that\\'s the thing, i don\\'t know... (in desktop it seems pointless,  but there would have to be a reason for it... )  nice... i\\'ll refresh once and a while to check its progress right now @solineoz  still isn\\'t great, so going back to browser based gitter the one thing that i noticed is audio.... raining like crazy here getting to be a pita @storbeck you\\'re going to take the 2.0 plunge? (is it out yet?) lol i still have to finish the codecademy angular course.... (am all over the place in sequential aspects) @toverto  it\\'s three back ticks (left of 1 key on standard keyboard) then shift + enter.. paste in between help formatting hiya @gevurah418  that dog looks like it gets snacks by sheer mind control *you will give me snack now, and these aren\\'t the droids we\\'re looking for* http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter5.html - makes me wonder about error handling (towards bottom of page, throw hey optical mouse(s) still work when soaked in coffee hiya @justinhernandez510  nice @progmacattack i\\'m on mobile but will go back in history when i get on laptop (and take a look) is it uriah heap + van halen? git for codepen lol so, valen better with hagar or roth? vanhalen nice drawing animation (responsive too viewed in mobile) do you have an interface that helps you conceptualize animation in scss roth does rule. (and has a dojo in japan) @storbeck  scss part tweak and go looks good you have a lot of patience twerk? lol @allanarmstrong  you can probably see the values to patterns  i started noticing that too seemed like it happened quickly this is why i\\'ve been procrastinating on codecademy\\' angular. nobody seems to like it. lol is 2 trying to be react? hmmm i\\'m sensing a shift in what i\\'m going to research that part i like (component ) modularity to a wide open language it\\'s almost bringing the desktop software model to the web now the java in your name makes sense lol hajava could be some ancient family name you know if your name was larryc++ it would be easier to detect lol welcome @johnnyjuicebox  it\\'s just referencing it for you. you have to write the magic bootstrap reference enables you to *use bootstrap * it saying the reference was done for you. but now you have to add/use bootstrap stuff yourself (in your divs ) np thanks for calling me out dude (classic) i\\'m so close to going to the dark side (react) there\\'s a third (beyond react and angular) @ageel, fcc references bootstrap for you in the lessons (hence behind the scenes) but you have to reference it in your own page as @storbeck stated (i.e., whatever you\\'re developing outside of the lessons, etc. ) there\\'s real time syntax checking in the fcc editor now i was going to say @abhisekp , it caught a console.log() statement after return...  linter on brackets is really picky can i say that i ignore a lot of it and still be a good person? lol i think it\\'s the strict part too @allanarmstrong it converts stuff to actual errors https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/strict_mode  it will slow down (the progress speed) now you\\'re in \\'thinking muck\\' this is what i love @robwar24 , you want to code? here it is... no general courses unrelated to what you want to do h i n t : different arguments are passed to evaluate your logic is what they mean by compiled (scss) so, what\\'s the \\'compiled\\' option in scss for codepen? ah, nice so, it\\'s not using any extended functionality (per se) but compiles 1:1 to good ole css? that\\'s a relief... because it would be kind of like a java virtual machine if not .... (that would suck) sassy ok, i\\'m seeing where the nested conversation started http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.scss_for_sass_users.html so, there was mention of merging styles into a single file.... how does that work with (at sign)import lol i wonder what it would be like to eat cheetos while sitting in a large server farm (no, that\\'s not an admin job i\\'d like) why because of the temp / humidity control? oh, there\\'s that too @usopn94 it presupposes  that your argument is going to be static (which is counter to this function\\'s purpose) sorry for the sass (lol) but i see a lot of integration with sublime (but i\\'m using brackets i see some there too) is the build system that much of a pita? yeah, i\\'m thinking that too editor wise... for whatever reason this is interesting,  (wading into design territory ) ok, before you take on recursion... know first that a function\\'s arguments aren\\'t static so, it\\'s not just 5.... it\\'s going to evaluate a number of (well,) numbers there is such a thing as static variables though, oh nvm @usopn94 what\\'s the 10 minute interval?  i want to see the weird + button oh it\\'s the stroke button style (as in causing) i can\\'t get twitch to play consistently  is that drop shadow? i do like materialize (especially the <li></li> buttons) somebody had a demo before button converts to list (maybe i\\'m easily impressed) you need to approach it like \\'what would i do (or not do do) with *any number* passed as an argument @usopn94  agreed gitter is a cpu hog yeah, it would be nice to have the channel sans the interface... but your experience says.... looking at the screenshots of hexchat (which looks interesting) it would seem just the announcements (entered room etc.,) alone would overwhelm client @anthonygallina1 try it and tell us what happens lol i\\'m on linux as well nice @iheartkode i think i bookmarked the pen hang on.... yeah, i saw a local reference to .js file @iheartkode  nice, you have two additional sets i still don\\'t get the goat thing lol it rendered for me .... omg i\\'ll never be the same this is why the whole matrix narrative would have never worked: no machine could come up with such a bad site i mean spinning dogs and rainbows? bye @iheartkode  i think he was having trouble getting over the argument hurdle  i don\\'t want to laugh but must lol do, de do lol another palindrome  that\\'s so weird @abhisekp you weren\\'t kidding (i see you added on to the proposal) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palindromic_number yeah yes, they\\'re insidious (subliminal messages) i now want to eat potted meat while coding (no explanation)  i think that has a different ring to it (that one would probably want to avoid in most industries) lol one bad (yeah, just that) about being assimilated by the borg, is there doesn\\'t seem to be an actual collective approach (i mean how many said, \"cube design bad.... let\\'s change it\" only to be shamed) hmm what \"looks good\" is entirely subjective in some cases there\\'s more emotional risk with design @kimkwanka that part i don\\'t like (homogeneous elements in webpages) so much  it\\'s like this (to me anyway) you have some (ultimately) visual element and somebody says \"that sucks, or is ugly\" that\\'s more emotionally damaging than \"your code sucks\" because one can subjectively make the code better (i tend towards coding btw)  @kimkwanka totally. @sangsatori understand what you\\'re saying (from the other end of spectrum) @elcortez there\\'s stuff actively going on with keystrokes (linter etc.,) when you\\'re doing exercise etc.,-- is there a specific issue that you\\'re running into? https://repl.it/languages --online... but, locally is my favorite (invoking node on local .js file) wait, what\\'s wrong with linkedin ? (broadly speaking) that is creepy @allanarmstrong  but linkedin has a business like quality to it (i see employers referencing it (that could also be the creepy factor that @allanarmstrong is talking about)) lol @allanarmstrong you didn\\'t sign-up for the super,super pro package even better than just pro how is a site about forklifts going to help lol i want an exoskeleton \"forklift\" like the one in aliens.   heya @petey9891  @sangsatori, my guess is figure out what you\\'re most inclined towards and concentrate on that (doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t (or don\\'t) learn the full spectrum of things) @lifeburner camperbot *is* sentient it\\'s just taking notes so that it can commandeer your toaster   @kathy-volpe maybe a dev job that\\'s hr centric could be your entry point agent or principal? (of cthulu) i would edit for spelling , but... it\\'s a weekday and all @nweat sometimes a survey isn\\'t as enlightening as experiencing it for yourself welcome @swrogers  `this` could be like this: `1*2*3` @shawhiz welcome.... (although, it\\'s not hell) lol @nweat i suppose i was answering it in the context of your original post (not trying to be contentious or anything) it had a competing e-learning vibe to it @sundiata2 welcome :smile:  i\\'m trying to make myself use more emotes i hate emotes but.... wait, there\\'s no \\'but\\' the hamster with the fedora makes it so much better i mean life without a hamster in a fedora would be so boring well, it could be early 90s madonna (which would add a whole new level of weirdness) you may need to switch \\'modes\\' (right hand side there\\'s convo icon - and keyboard icon (compose)) manually. after you paste your code etc., the icon will be \"keyboard\"... try changing that (back to chat mode) and then press enter (this is after you\\'ve followed all of the formatting requirements etc.) hmmm ... if it works for you, go with it.  gitter has some quirks, no doubt. big whiteboard is a great tool hello, i am igor... i am wanting to learn lisp for making great idea yeah, totally @shifthawke .. it sucks ok back, how much \\'quality discussion\\' did i miss? lol oh, you\\'re all talking about sudoku great about as much as knitting @dwd2010  ok, no i don\\'t like knitting it\\'s a comparison to things that i would likely not do (knitting, sudoku) hi @ccallen001  yes, be productive and go to the waypoints.... (escape the chat while you can!) welcome @jongoesboom  sounds like a good interview question \"suppose stack overflow is down, what do you do\"? heya @phajava  it\\'s more geared towards \"what do you do if you can\\'t look something up\"? lol i saw all the \"oh, cr*p so is down\" posts and it just made me chuckle  @iheartkode on mobile your avatar looks like e.t.\\'s lighted finger (et phone home) @jbmartinez where did you go? (good to see you) hate is a strong word. i don\\'t hate emotes, i loathe them lol gitter mobile renders things so weird btw hope you feel better @shifthawke  you and @jbmartinez are making me all sappy noooo brackets alrighty then same here mobile too limited the infinity shakespeare thing was wrong  lol no? you\\'re so wrong omg not wordpress true, but i think if you get too much into wordpress you\\'re in for more wordpress.... (i.e.,. limiting yourself to that) agreed, @storbeck , @allanarmstrong  @thedigitalmonk do you have an incentive plan? @thedigitalmonk i know how opensource works, thanks. people can be shills for anything i suppose yeah, totally that\\'s a vulcan  are the goats gone from your app now @iheartkode (yes, contained in the array) lol node.js rock on the issue is you\\'re conflating php with worpress.... the former can live without the latter  larva? welcome @jigglyduff  yeah, it\\'s very similar to os comparisons  well, @muzza96 you\\'re certainly an honest person lol wrong this is good this doesn\\'t involve selling water purifiers or soap does it @ashroulston ? heyyyyy what did you do the the links @shifthawke ? lol  hi @cryptoedge  @shifthawke it\\'s like this: [casual room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/casual) grrrrr wtf ok, better.... the gitter markup, if there\\'s a space it won\\'t work oh, we\\'ve found camperbot yeah, i\\'ve thought the same nooo slurred type i saw when @abhisekp got his 666 th brownie 657 is the mark of the beast now? lol, yeah he should be @shifthawke what about page 999 hi @bayasglan  when /collapse doesn\\'t work part a oh, it\\'s just for that? that sucks there should be an option for (collapsing) formatted code too i wonder if there are any health risks associated with ascii versions of emotes gigantic robots camperbot feasts on squirrels i\\'m convinced  they drop their acorns and run like he^^ when camperbot walks by that kind of looks like the old icon for the cassette tape (ancient recording medium) @shifthawke  oh, that\\'s totally better even the best app people will begin to find fault with depends on market  an still be eating ramen and f that lol what kind of issue are you experiencing @effriam  did you refresh? hang on... a second @effriam what\\'s the waypoint # associated? ok, @effriam  didn\\'t notice any issue with the waypoint when i accessed it wow i switch to mobile and look what happens jobs in general are like that. sometimes the candidate they really wanted flaked. and so you get the call if there are no skills listed assume you\\'re going to be walking on a stage and move on. lol it\\'s optional some people pair program oh, i thought they were being vague on the type of skills mobile sucks i need a bluetooth keyboard for mobile i tried voice but kept getting errant expletives in translation oh i want my blackberry now i\\'m sad.  i know your secret love for all things research in motion that\\'s right omg he was f ng with you  yeah bad plan this has happened to me in other contexts snl you sleep, where\\'s the question mark non relational and generally json i\\'m not a big fan of no sql but it\\'s good for a lot of things it\\'s all context i look away for 2 seconds if you\\'re not fond of the data go with mongo and then there\\'s mcdonald\\'s the notifications will drive you mad yeah i\\'m wondering the same thing wow puts ice scraper/brush back it would be neat to make a patio weather station app eloquent js is a good read and any crockford video  np now i know why that screen name creates dissonance: andy kaufman had a character called nick ferrari. lol pumpkin spice is magic it\\'s the (pumpkin) spice that make things good: pumpkin, itself, is pretty much tasteless mush meh never too late see? now don\\'t you have an overwhelming sense of satisfaction? yes, you now understand the power of \\'the camperbot\\' lol welcome @jonc12450  github? about @jonc12450  try clicking the login with github button  or what @arielleslie has ^ welcome @tommydnt  ```\\n<!-- i\\'m commented -->\\n\\ni\\'m not commented\\n\\n<!-- i\\'m commented here,\\nas well as here.\\n-->\\n\\nremove (<!-- && -->)\\nand i\\'ll go back to being \\nun-commented\\n\\n<!-- i could be some line of html that\\ni want to disable for testing without \\naffecting other stuff, or just to comment\\nabout stuff that i\\'m doing -->\\n``` commenting code (actual js (and insert language here)... is really important to sanity of yourself (and more so of others) oh no @jbmartinez is getting close to \\'the number\\' the power of javascript compels you  hama kyā bhāṣā mēṁ bāta kara rahē haiṁ?

that\\'s tight @kimkwanka  @jbmartinez help two more people he\\'s 2 away from 666 brownies i totally want to see the pea soup typing @jbmartinez have you suddenly been speaking in (classical) latin? retro-look is neat, (should be in a magazine ad from the 50s) nooo not that part that ^ i have to show great restraint in my ziplines which i\\'ll get to pretty shortly..... (i.e., i\\'m on the fence about giant cats with laser eyes) what exists only in the states? i\\'m totally not into gaming (although i can\\'t really be high-and-mighty and all: gitter is a total productivity sucker) it\\'s that camperbot that pulls you in sup yes, i do @thec0mposer  if you mean terminal (linux user here) go ahead you\\'re doing this in bash, right? (i.e., not trying it as a one liner) hmmm are you using this in conjunction with grep? try prepending with this: 2>&1 you\\'re setting up \\'environment\\' for what you echoed i believe try typing env in terminal (the one you have open) ok, m.u.u... can you type env @thec0mposer  lol or m.o.t.u \\'master of the universe\\' yeah it\\'s badass you have some skills oh tax collector one what\\'s the broader exercise? like why  or \\'what\\' are you ultimately trying to do ? if you\\'re writing a script in bash there\\'s a header at the top of your .sh file that looks (although different in some cases) like this: #! /bin/bash you can paste (i think \\\\n is retained) a column into terminal  but i don\\'t think you can chain those but why, i\\'ve never used treehouse, wtf are they teaching you lol like what\\'s the context/end goal of the exercise oh, yes vista i owe my linux knowledge to vista had a borked recovery image or something.... and bought a linux disk/magazine.. i might check out that treehouse, exercise you\\'re doing... i like (at least) the direction that they\\'re going about @jbmartinez  oh, yeah so, close yeah, i saw that a week or two before... he was asking questions/ getting feedback etc. (i think this is same thing) yeah, looks like he\\'s done some work to it in the last week nan it\\'s great! @davidh250  you\\'ll learn lots of javascript (and other stuff) depends oh, ok go ahead hang on @thec0mposer  do you mean like the inverse of running env in terminal (where you see a whole list etc.) you want to specify \\'which\\' or point it to? still there @thec0mposer  when you type env in terminal... are you seeing what you originally exported? you\\'re not actually doing this in terminal? ok, good item to include lol hold on i need some coffee let\\'s do this realtime with terminal open brb so, you have terminal open? @thec0mposer  hmmm this is good overated about @jbmartinez  grr thanks @jbmartinez  ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! split pea soup time now you must levitate and speak in languages you\\'ve never heard (not computer languages, because i know you love even the most obscure) interesting @jurgenzz , but the entire house is the hover object (it\\'s intuitive at least for me to click a section/or panel of the house) the house itself doesn\\'t hover  like some people with 666 brownie points it looks neat i like it batperson there was a show called ultraman i think you should show heat escaping from the house (with that demonstration) to show how much money you lose without proper insulation (or you could have giant iguanas escaping) wow, a lot of stuff on that subreddit @quincylarson seems like there\\'s a marked urgency (or confluence) of exposure (medium, reddit (redux) quora, etc.,) must be exciting   i think that ms\\' historical approach to things has been proven untenable going, forward.... they\\'re making inroads to opensource because they have to @lifeburner setting that up through wine is kind of a mess relative in what context ? ( high volume licenses for os, or framework type stuff) howdy @dwitjes89  ok, i\\'m going back to the 90s in my mind (i\\'ve been on the other side of this argument (i think) btw) i\\'m imagining listening to a lot of self loathing generational music on my journey back to the 90s and the perspective of business climate with reference to ms  you mean r.e.m?  i think emo was some sort of muppet @quincylarson i believe that (it comes through in a lot of different ways) seriously heya @aoxom  hey, the functioning works... only a couple of things... there\\'s an alignment issue with the buttons (and the only other thing kind of nit picky i know.... is when you press clear (it clears) but most calcs go back to 0 when cleared) yeah, i think your 0 button is skewing and the plus now it\\'s cold again it sucks yeah, that was pretty epic fail @davidh250  t thx @shifthawke  doesn\\'t let you post i would imagine  i think the specs were marking completed you could use a simple backend db i wasn\\'t talking about codepen like politics sounds good i love \\'the bobs\\' from office space so, true that it\\'s funny (is why it\\'s funny) \\'consultants\\' now i\\'m thinking about office space scenes. great. t h a n ks lol i don\\'t want to invoke \\'the bot\\' with regex which is worse, michael bolten or milton i think flochart has something to do with a late 70s show called diner i was so in the middle of talking about shell stuff, but then convo went south earlier... so, now it\\'s all office space all the time lol shell as in the layer between you and your os for executing commands maybe because c is strict \\'er\\' you\\'re talking about algorithms javascript (via node) is not known for its typing   i was following @terakilobyte \\'s node to c calling.... (and was thinking is it because, c has typing that\\'s strict vs. javascript (which is not known for typing) with all the heavy algorithm stuff) make sense @lifeburner  ? oh, i see what you\\'re saying oh, great now i\\'m off into serious thread mgmt reading pthread (am i on the right track?) i don\\'t (linux is my primary os) well, i guess  pthreads-w32 might quench your thirst for fire there so, if i ever finish codecademy\\'s angular... then i\\'ll pretty much be forced to do react am i learning beta-max with current iteration of angular?  well? angular suck or no suck (as in does it suck) but it\\'s going to change (fundamentally it sounds like) but that\\'s the opposite of  the whole paradigm @storbeck yeah there\\'s a good representation (here) of folks on both sides of that this is the thing.... if you\\'ve been doing something (and we have all of our favorite langs/databases/ what have you) for awhile.... then you have a strong opinion, i just feel like coming into javascript modularity as a noob angular has an uncertain feel (as a snapshot in time) to it.  finish the angular course and shut up (this is my advice to myself) lol good point (we aren\\'t limited to one or the other) @terakilobyte  i\\'m watching a video about algebra on a friday night. wtf is wrong with me what kind of stylus + software is he using to write out stuff? that\\'s wicked cool (i could use that) when a white-board type concept is needed during a screencast what\\'s a boston (besides a city)? do i have to buy some special sort of (for said leaking boston)? i have never heard that term oh, i get it whew really, is that a boston thing? saying \"wicked\" a lot? that could be bad, (i.e., sitting in stands of opposing team) and be mis-identified as a boston fan because i say \\'wicked\\' a lot.... i\\'m giving you brownies for warning me lol thanks @storbeck  i think what you\\'re saying is our education system sucks  yeah, it\\'s hard to argue against that ^ i\\'m way beyond that there are 29 nations ranking ahead of us (those of us in \\'us\\') in math... seriously, common core? no we actually suck admitting that you suck, is the first step in not sucking same here that\\'s a lot on the language plate japanese is difficult watching anime and learning japanese is not the same thing (it\\'s like saying star trek is a klingon learning language exercise) sigh lol nihongo ga desk ka? desk = desu f ng auto correct it\\'s been about 20 years since i studied japanese (and trust me i don\\'t get a lot of language reinforcement in these neck of the woods).... so, give me break lol muffins are cool pumpkin ones with cream cheese so portable  i don\\'t know your muffin reference lowes sells hammers and particle board and keychains that say \"not for climbing \" like i\\'d entrust my life to a trinket from home depot or lowes hey, i\\'m going mountain climbing i got this here, keychain what could go wrong? is that david bowie different colored eyes muffin you don\\'t need to spend a lot of money.... there\\'s so much out there in terms of learning resources (i.e., all kinds of free sh^^ to learn just about anything) i still want to know, the stylus+app setup that was used on that learning tree video i\\'m on east coast too music bugs me (when coding)  i saw activity related to that old link @jbmartinez .... weird it\\'s still there hexchat i might try (based in suggestions) on please don\\'t be the lady at dollar general that\\'s a case where the actual expletive would have been better @saintpeter  lol ok segue  horsepower to weight ratio camperbot only seeks to be understood yes camperbot i will obey only camperbot  i just realized that the birds are braces a week ago lane splitting is fun until grandma two cars ahead decides to open door the there\\'s the opposite, i think it dangerous to be in center of lane when stopped at a light.  i\\'m on mobile. contractions all messed up welcome @hellokai  and @perrywortman  i\\'m on mobile but is that a guitar ? nice (the avatars shrink down) i have used the desktop version on linux. it sucks sucks in the sense that it offers no features found in browser version not found that is i wanted it to work (desktop apps are sometimes better yes heresy ) but gitter doesn\\'t do it  try opening a browser instance and desktop instance at the same time. and compare (switch back and forth to test feature set) ten key pad bindings  @abunadhrah  you may want to paste your code help formatting explain format  i need coffee and laptop  three back ticks then ctrl + shift paste code in between like a sandwich  help format  wtf slowly being caffeinated  evilfunction lol the mobile gitter sucks (yes, i say this over and over) but it has a list of suggested rooms (i had no idea that there was a node room (this is the broader gitter)) yeah, but isn\\'t there a cap on number of users? (i.e., have to go pro) there\\'s a good vibe going community wise... it\\'s unique i don\\'t use fb yeah stack overflow can be totally hostile (imo) or sort of snooty  not that i don\\'t use so, but you\\'re right. they seem to get stuck on process, and not helping yeah, i can see the overall logic about it but still me either @lisandroalves that\\'s true cats are the answer to everything careful, @kimkwanka  you\\'re so close to the perfect calculator .... (it will takeover your life, and you\\'ll be muttering to yourself \"what if it does this? what if it could do that?\") that\\'s classic typing style (i.e., top row lateral layout) ...i\\'ve never really used that (always been numpad) you need to use giant cats @shifthawke  i have... there were netbooks that didn\\'t have numpad (so yes, i\\'d use) but you can always plug a usb numbpad into those (which i did) some of the early asus netbooks did not have numpad yes, targus has a usb numpad @alexdclark which waypoint is this? @alexdclark paste your code (please).... it might be the sizing in the class  declaration itself is off yeah, typos get all of us numpad is a deal breaker for me gotta have it welcome @amrinder211  @amrinder211 post your question,  folks here will help great, what\\'s the question? start here: http://www.freecodecamp.com/map the tracing thing looks really neat *because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it* another nudge towards react grrr i\\'m having windows xp flashbacks  @evaristoc how\\'s the progress on results of (data science stuff) that you were going to publish? we do have hoverboards: http://www.lexus-int.com/amazinginmotion/slide/ but it\\'s chicken or egg.... is this because of the movie or despite it? nice @evaristoc ... this is a little different than the training aspect for sample. there were some interesting aspects about other areas of analysis (e.g., what other qualitative things) you could gain from beginning -ending stuff that\\'s the problem....  sample size too small true how so? (because you can prep stuff with scripting) i think one of the requirements was js (i recall a repo that somebody had done that \\'js afied\\' some bash based stuff) the potato is a marvelous wonder @evaristoc agreed. i\\'m just thinking patterns yet to be discovered (total \\'down the rabbit hole\\' thing...) @evaristoc nah, good stuff. keep plugging along @evaristoc i will think about this.  not like tomorrow or anything bye @evaristoc  don\\'t eat carrot cake with cream cheese on an empty stomach hey hey i would say hey but i think there\\'s a limit welcome new people oh sure you get a hey back if you\\'re @kimkwanka lol   i have to go to dollar general to be called doll what\\'s up with that? stop at a month or less you need to really learn the concepts. especially in the bay area because you\\'re going to have a lot of competition the point of feedback is to get well feedback positive or negative you are running a brownie deficit  soon you will have to have wheelbarrows of brownies to get the same value lol what\\'s that? this thing: ```>:)``` looks like a cute sparrow (far from evil looking) yeah, no... still cute that looks like a muppet don\\'t know about php aspect; however, you can setup an email server on linux (pita, and not a lite topic if you\\'re just messing with stuff for experimentation) (locally that is) me too sardine ice cream rules full sardine (heads and tails) sprinkles on ice cream is the best he\\'ll probably take your motorcycle and sunglasses too \\'it\\' i should say see, it is a pita i ate cream cheese carrot cake; however, camperbot did not attempt to stop me so, i\\'m thinking it is logging my glutenous consumption for later use  there\\'s a code review room i believe @jbmartinez what\\'s the room invocation yep.... help rooms there ^ codereview what\\'s your question @jimyallam  and  don\\'t see any col-xs-6 can you paste the code instead? (that is preferred to screenshots) yeah, you get a pass for that cause of the cute cats and all @dianka947 awesome. and you, also, thought about security right? (the putting it together part is very impressive) @markielock i was wondering the same about the wapoint url size (they\\'re mostly spaces) this might be helpful http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_encodeuricomponent.asp if you\\'re doing stuff from a home/local server.... doing some (imo a lot) of research on security approaches well save you some headaches  @iheartkode that looks pretty cool so far  i like the blur on the edge of image (i say this only because i know you like to work with images too) i like the code window background better (but there is a neat effect in the old one when you hover) have you been eating a lot of sugar, @shifthawke ? (admit it) you\\'re not chasing tootsie rolls with vodka are you ? lol  that\\'s so wrong cya ok, so it\\'s over linode and is virtual... better welcome @flight846  linux is awsome (my main os) so you get double points for setting up what you did (that\\'s great!)...i\\'m just a bit of a security curmudgeon don\\'t mind me (but good to talk about if you\\'re going to go wide audience) is that like ohana @oohhnnaa ? cool, welcome wow, steep drop in chat activity welcome @carito057  wait, an actual newspaper? like with paper and stuff? i had to read that twice (not a critique, some folks prefer tactile learning...) just interested in source article wow i don\\'t know why this amazes me (maybe because it\\'s halloween, here in us)  if it\\'s got peanut butter and choco... i\\'m sold gummies are good especially the worms (yes, i still buy those) $800 for a choco bar awesome @aoxom  no, you\\'re plugging along great... @aoxom  it\\'s #5 in intermediate @dwitjes89  i have to admit classic (or depending on what you think...ansi) c, is kind of interesting (have thought about actually finishing the book i have on it) (yes, made of paper) lol this thing is totally ancient (from the 80s) yeah regex is best learned with some starting point: http://www.regexr.com/ -- https://regex101.com welcome @ianhf  @antoniohoyen i\\'ve found debian based distros to be the least headache inducing generally speaking, it will be ubuntu (for least headache) ... repos are larger to draw (and in most flavors, easier package mgmt -but you have sub choices there too) @antoniohoyen  i tried fedora (a really long time ago, about the time you did) i didn\\'t like it so much i use kde (f unity - sorry strong feeling there) and use fallback + mate another distro (that uses enlightenment) based on ubuntu is bodhi... interesting but quirky as a guest i like the screen edges in kde mate is smooth and simple yeah, but it\\'s quirky... (i want to like it, but there\\'s some stuff that\\'s a pita) @phoenixlaef totally pretty much (by either installing kde (full) desktop) or using kubuntu mint is neat too... if they had lts i\\'d think about it seriously (played with mint for awhile) @phoenixlaef it\\'s been awhile since i looked at their download(s)... are they not doing rolling releases? that\\'s the magic cross domain thing @phoenixlaef funny you should mention that (i was on their download page) totally not fruitfal @phoenixlaef thanks (here\\'s some brownies lol) i think i\\'ll put mint on the list to play with in vm (it\\'s been awhile - but looks like they\\'ve grown a bit)   walking and using gitter is a bad idea i\\'m walking now i have to come up with the big data science idea you could pull stats if nyc taxi vs uber of i\\'m sure the taxi people would love you for that response times, satisfaction measures i don\\'t know how much of that date is available on either side data i\\'d go with uber but that\\'s just me i would look at the link however i don\\'t want to walk into a stop sign i\\'m  a bot noooo emotes  bots use those but don\\'t like them wasn\\'t worf (however you spell it)  also half human (like spock) there seem to be a self loathing (for human side) theme though the whole franchise  same here 100% bot nice but south america that\\'s f\\'d up  did you get environment path straightened out? no shell is a shell. windows used to be based on dos wayback in the day  you can add interactivity to shell scripts check out zenity i\\'m not a big mongo fan but certs don\\'t hurt bustin da rhymes  seriously though certs  can be good on a resume for backend  then there\\'s bench pressing i\\'m challenged you can run sql commands entirely and terminal if you like -and in lol i gave @jbmartinez his 666th brownie linus made a kernel that was unix like way back in the day.  the shell has to have an operating system to interact with  the shell doesn\\'t exist independently from is or kernel os f,ng auto correct noooo lol i have to use windows in some cases but it\\'s relegated to a vm. i just can\\'t stand windows now i like sql server though lol we bots are amused by the way you humans process organic material we bots have no need for such things. hail camperbot  no what do you use google translate for the exercises? that would be a great project you\\'re talking about credentials  your database credentials can be intertwined with your user account technically however those are completely independent concepts  database credentials aren\\'t tied to the operating system in fact it\\'s separate but if you want to you can sync those  you can add users and groups two different applications in linux to gitter is crapping out but database access is an entirely separate item user management is part of the database app you could have access to some items with in the database and some items not within the database does that make sense?  i\\'m on mobile and i\\'m trying to explain  database administration concepts what\\'s wrong with me?  lol gitter is crapping out peel is actually on my to do list perl i\\'m looking at it but mobile github is weird it bounced back to your main  i\\'m going to book mark it see i don\\'t hate its syntax like @jbmartinez does lol lol it\\'s funny javascript is looking less weird to me now i don\\'t know if that\\'s a good or bad thing that\\'s wrong lol hi 20,000 people no just sayin hi lol yeah that was the flavor i was going for same here @terakilobyte always is raising the bar and forcing me to think  i am yes that looks neat i have to switch to laptop can i bookmark this nice it\\'s weird and all open source but there still holdovers in things for me open enrollment? because that\\'s when everybody wants projects completed all of a sudden it\\'s like getting a bunch of emails at 5 pm on a friday never fails that\\'s deep @terakilobyte  didn\\'t you used to have an avatar with thumbs up ? codepen quietly does that? i\\'m into selectiveness is there auto magic in codepen as in quietly selecting libs i saw canada but i got lost somewhere in the conversation fcc rocks! i sometimes feel as though i am the marshmallow i\\'m on mobile that everything renders the same lol not  i think i\\'ll keep brackets (this is coming from somebody who likes  genie y wow  i\\'m talking into chat so proper grammar and spelling are out i like it if you want to go for speed sublime for me geany is fast and no nag  but i like brackets too it\\'s slow as f.  but the feature set is unmatched  whiteboard and marker that explains a lot lol free handing stuff verses dia like can get you there quicker for concepts everybody has their own style yeah but what if it\\'s heels with goldfish you may not want to copy welcome @kennyk3  @phajava lurks a lot lol totally but not at this second because of question and all @solineoz you\\'re in luck there\\'s a lot of folks who contribute to those here now (i\\'m not one of those lol) waypoints are not tied to cert i believe zip lines and base jumps. are the operative chime in anybody but you should have an understanding of html and css (won\\'t be able to do much without) i\\'m on stupid mobile @phajava  i shall have to boot up the old laptop brb @propersharp there was an extra newline appended to your hello welcome @emma-tzy-0917  @koouty hopefully you\\'re just using ie9 to just test - but this might be helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5472938/does-ie9-support-console-log-and-is-it-a-real-function @groundxaero having daylight savings and being reminded that ie(any version) is still out in the wild at the same time.... for some reason, made me chuckle @koouty if you must use ie, then you should probably upgrade it to highest version (or install chrome  or firefox hint, hint) doesn\\'t work hamsters with hats have no power over me lol about @elfborne  looks like whatever the error was resolved (or you signed in with github (good) try using gitter on mobile if you need a hand warmer stream buffers a lot (twitch) you are @allanarmstrong lol i i\\'m feeling anything but  my english sucks too  trinken i\\'ve stumbled into german chat dance like a butterfly code like a bee gitter has a billion rooms already bait and switch (if you want to have this \"extra functionality \") is a pain you\\'re what?

@farhanihmida welcome ok, errant linkedin profile just went by lol ```(\" \")``` split @lifeburner yep @judgebowser you have to give a reference to how you want to split... could be \" \" or \"whateverhere\" \"-\", and so on do you mind pasting your code?

but won\\'t i sound like bob dole? welcome @oldpastelsoul  @qmikew1 likes oatmeal  hey, what\\'s all this stuff about heroku and credit cards? (btw) oh, they\\'re using the microsoft model there are evaluation modes etc., (or even aws i think too) you can use (x) for (n) time but we won\\'t charge (not talking heroku specifically but... the have to have card thing) @saintpeter that\\'s a good tip @lifeburner exactly (azure) the first one was better lol no, your typo luckily it\\'s not the whole banana  i\\'d tend to agree with the openshift (if i had a mysql db behind app etc.,); however, there are still cases where sql server is \\'the thing\\' behind... and would say azure would be (begrudgingly)  better in that case  @lifeburner i just checked (thanks for link i\\'d (i\\'l) use openshift for more open source type stuff) they don\\'t offer the tier to your country ....that sucks @sangsatori are you on linux? @sangsatori if you want web based there are a couple of gpls among this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_time-tracking_software i didn\\'t really comb through the list.... so, can\\'t vouch for applicability/utility @lifeburner they\\'ll wait until you\\'ve got everything setup then....  *we\\'re sorry to inform you that your country doesn\\'t support our service* and... please don\\'t respond to this email lol @sangsatori build it i will use it now i want trout for some reason i dunno a bit of lemon and garlic could make that trout better i\\'m thinking about it i\\'ve got an ever growing list of things to \\'sign-up and create stuff on\\' going have to do codepen first ... so, i can get through my curriculum requirements @lifeburner i guess i could, don\\'t know about the whole blogging thing (not sure i could keep interest throughout post) lol @janitor93 remove the parenthesis --- they are for groups, you have a single item \\\\s ```replace(/\\\\s/g,\"\");``` will only remove spaces. but your original regex is malformed @janitor93  @janitor93 you\\'re just removing spaces there in that regex. take a look at http://www.regexr.com/... you probably want to specify *what you don\\'t want* in some cases (hint) read it or you\\'ll go mad hunting and pecking @qmikew1 wonders if starting a flame war about angular vs. react (to get away from the 3rd rail \\'politics & religion\\' ) would be effective @combsco i was looking through the vue.js site and it has alternate chinese and japanese sites... got me wondering.... what are the strategies that non english speakers use to code?  @lifeburner yeah, as it\\'s what you\\'ll see behind pretty much everything (code wise) ted talk isn\\'t going to work today (time wise) lol @jsommamtek i looked at on both mobile and desktop... (understand the footnote about codepen images not rendering etc.) the split pane thing is odd (for different reasons) in both @thec0mposer no idea... but it will *tell you* (by way of not working) if it needs it. i know build essential in the context of linux, (don\\'t know much about mac; however, there are some extra steps involved) i have to admit i was sitting in a coffee shop when i first did the initial exercises (and felt a little self conscious about having an app full of cats an a large laptop screen) lol  i *know* everybody was looking at me @clevertrout  well, that took a turn @thec0mposer that\\'s a pretty broad question.... depends on a lot of stuff.  your initial question was (i think, about some sort of addon for package management for mac) that\\'s \\'broad package\\' mgmt... node (e.g., and if you\\'re going to use it) has its own mgmt. etc.  install whatever database setup you\\'re going to use and try to update it... then make a determination. welcome @storbeck  bat person coming down off the sugar are you now i bet you feel yucky all sugared out and all (i know the carrot cake did it to me) with cream cheese knowledge of relational database concepts that would be the select query lo l go back to my first comment i don\\'t know the content of those lessons, but something is telling me that they\\'re not giving you foundational knowledge special? @thec0mposer it\\'s not meant to be insulting seriously i\\'m just saying, look into it a bit (it will make your journey infinitely  easier)... (i.e., read up on relational database theory (and/or a learn sql in x number of days book)  yeah i\\'m rooting for ya @thec0mposer  @roelver the board is cool it\\'s cool but depresses me (but, motivates!) yeah, but still depressing lol the only thing i don\\'t like about the leaderboard is it\\'s the same principal used by sales types oh look i ranked on the alternate (bitter leader) board! @kylebiancardi those will be crucial to subsequent exercises.... you\\'ll be looping through stuff a lot (in exercise and in programming in general) you could be looping through a string, an array blah, blah --creating counters etc. the list goes on yep it could be i, b, or larry if you wanted i like to eat sardines. if this doesn\\'t pan out... i\\'m going to be a professional sardine eater (contests and stuff) i will be #1 sardine eater... people will stare when i walk by and say \"is that the.... professional sardine master?\" and i\\'ll chuckle to myself \"ha, loathsome non-sardine master eaters\" @roelver can i make a suggestion? (when you look at your own rank, can there be info on the total from which it\\'s being pulled) like you\\'re nth out of nth  there\\'s also --  (e.g., i-- ) it does the opposite it decrements (but don\\'t get hung up on \\'i\\' it could be any name you give it) i agree (with js being more interesting) you\\'re not constrained by the curriculum, (can branch out on whatever technology you want) what  song ? oh yeah  i\\'m on mobile so i\\'m challenged with scrolling  @thec0mposer that is a sh^^ load of stuff. what rdbms vendor are you going to use? muppet scary muppet @thec0mposer i think you\\'re conflating package management with node (which has its own) to database stuff first step... pick what you\\'re going to work with (be it mysql, postgresql, ms sql server) list goes on (and i\\'m talking relational) @thec0mposer  the (really long) list of stuff had bulk bcp and ctes in it... that\\'s sql server (if i had to bet - ok, not bet that\\'s a ms list) what\\'s with the followers thing? would feel like a preacher or something oh, that\\'s scary yeah, and does it involve some compound in south america jimgroundxaerojones lol nc what\\'s this is it a state ? oh,  do people eat pork there? in nc and drink whisky oh, those are good i should move there and eat pork and drink whisky and eat gummies wait that sounds really good.... @lifeburner i came from similar background in terms of multicultural  welcome @vieira83  start with exercises and ask for help if you get stuck  that wiki (stub?) has some grammar issues @theodrick what took you so long, welcome aboard  *\"eide was aggressive toward staff and showed signs of intoxication of alcohol and/or drugs,\"*, really? i\\'m totally surprised, i mean breaking into a zoo and petting a tiger isn\\'t ..... lol (testing @joepurdy thanks!) hey, it\\'s still offline @joepurdy  @joepurdy (i was trying to test, because i saw your comment above... (feedback)) @urobert listen to your intuition, but delay it. if you get hung up on optimization too early it\\'s going discourage progress @abhisekp is it the fact that the room names (are in effect) hardcoded into the array? (just a noob learning question) got it @abhisekp yeah that jumps out at you  when you look at it they\\'re redeemable for toasters and office supplies  welcome @carlosandres22  i\\'d go with the online/book(s) resource(s)... (i mean that\\'s where a tutor (have never heard of that)) would be getting the information). + how do you know that you wouldn\\'t be picking up (potentially) bad coding habits of said tutor.? yes, but many universities (in terms of full courses) are behind on current technology @tmbbutler  but what i\\'m saying is that\\'s *transferable* to a tutor (i.e., the accreditation point). so, it would be the same thing but on a 1:1 basis (imo you\\'d be better off with online resources + books, but i get where you\\'re coming from, @tmbbutler )   @tmbbutler fcc has certs (that would be the demonstration (in part, and most clear to potential employers) i think, while it\\'s connected (learning and application) it\\'s different from the tutor thing.  i\\'m in bonfire\\'ville yep, i\\'ll (probably) be starting ziplines in a few days... (depending on my workload and how much i procrastinate here) oh, it\\'s back up nice lol i think @storbeck is using the drip method of suggestion  storbot status lol dang storbot is down storbot has either achieved sentience or somebody wrote a lot of recursive stuff somewhere lol it\\'s the hamster again welcome @dwydwys  think of the ipo potential   batperson! if i want to do the medium thing, do i have to have a picture (being a hand model, my hands are trademarked and all) both? yeah i agree should i use special lighting? oooh i\\'m thinking about it i know you ( @jbmartinez ) and @storbeck are going to (may have already done so) do it nice (digg) that was a good post (raising the bar) https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-you-should-be-using-bem-badcaa66371b really @jbmartinez ? your english is native speaker level (nuances, all that fun stuff). i can\\'t imagine that lol heya @abouleila  hey i got one what about a primer on sass?  yeah, you\\'re right (it\\'s hard to find the \\'something different aspect\\') what about a \\'when does it click (on the design side)\\'? like \"i found this moment when....\" (i\\'m describing in 3rd person... as this isn\\'t applicable to me lol) welcome @x30n1 , @isiomaogbuehi  there were two wwfs at one time (one with macho man randy savage, the other with pandas) one had to change their name to wwe (never been the same)...  @ametthey you will get plenty-o-plenty javascript learning here (understatement)  es6 weirds me out. there\\'s a lot of stuff that looks good (more efficient, etc.) and there\\'s support for it (not complete of course) but just something ... there\\'s a philosophy thing to javascript though, c might introduce some issues there if you\\'re planning to learn js as a first language (not that i have any issues with c, finishing my c book is like nbr 598 on my to do list) @qmikew1 blames @saintpeter for starting me down the path of snl skits with jon luvitz as the devil in the people\\'s court (much earlier post lol) @schmyriam welcome and, @sacmalad  fortune teller there was a lag  and... @storbeck will comment on elegance i got 2 out of 2 what?  you mean you responded before i guessed (impossible) lol well this better workout because my fallback as a licensed fortune teller + hand model seems shaky i know i complain about this but gitter really does push my mobile phone\\'s proc nice congrats on zipline siri can\\'t get most of the groups or titles correct when calling up itunes content google makes ms (potentially) of the early years (in terms of shenanigans) look small time  i don\\'t think they\\'re evil... but they have an enormous amount of influence of/over things.... (analytics isn\\'t passive)  $30.00 i didn\\'t buy one @qmikew1 hangs head in shame i\\'m going to use permanent marker and a screen projector to make my own hey, what about fcc decals (semi-seriously)? be cool to have a fcc case sticker to throw along os  @hiltydiggs that\\'s what i\\'m sayin bye @hiltydiggs  only issue i have with the swarm metaphor, is ants lay down extreme pheromone in cases other than food that\\'s pretty heavy stuff though (ant colony system (heuristics))... @terakilobyte am looking through it now (absorbing) or attempting to wow i went up to the index, the clever algorithms (all kinds of stuff) in the index under (other) programming paradigms, thought this was interesting (for what ever reason) *another example is the popular idiom of map-reduce which is an application of functional programming principles organized into a data flow model* @terakilobyte thanks for link (it has a lot of pointers ( in addition to its main thrust)) these are typically located next to the yoda figurines  ever find yourself wishing that there was a reverse caret ^ (other than lowercase v)? has to be in the lower bounds of the ascii (no not uppercase !) lol yeah i could render it with character codes, but not when i\\'m commenting  yeah but... &and; would look like this in my comment ```&and`` === this is what i\\'m doing up here.. (would make no sense) like this ^========== this is what i\\'m doing up here (in a comment) currently: (without a reverse caret (in lowerbound ascii set) \\nmy comment v==========this is what i\\'m doing down here (in a comment) just bugs me i can render all kinds of stuff in actual output, but my comments are dry nooo! lol ah, the lowly comment block... forever resigned to ascii art i can render... people. your application to the unicode consortium has been denied. lol that\\'s what i have but the reverse is limited to lowercase v like =============v no must have the reverse caret (magical , unicorn reverse caret) i know so, there is nothing beyond \\'v\\' because an entity character won\\'t render in comments would look like this ```&darr;``` and rendered in actual output (of course) would look like this &darr; that is pretty cool @storbeck  i can\\'t see where something not encoded in utf-8 (even at the editor level) would be an issue (even the crappiest have encoding options) just feels weird going outside the \\'keyboard set\\' in my comment blocks watch, there will be some change in future.... and after listening to you all my commented code will come alive and bork everything i\\'ve created lol it\\'s so subtle, that it works lol they\\'re neat if you want non-coders to stop talking to you, start talking about character encoding or star wars (less so, but really close) over coffee @balance17 yes. you will forget everything what\\'s endubueze will i be hit up for my creditcard @balance17 it will take repetition (so, be prepared to go back (google etc) and revisit lots of stuff .... over, and over... (it\\'s normal/expected) no magic @someshe welcome nooo yes, i comment like hell no, it\\'s for you no, \\'you\\' means collective people following /debugging later  (but yes, mostly for me )lol @jbmartinez deleted his calc because of @kimkwanka \\'s (awesome ) calc gee, that\\'s sensitive lol here\\'s the calc http://codepen.io/kimkwanka/details/vvqgpj @kimkwanka  (not mine) lol...  i used this cool thing called google it like gives answers n stuff @theodrick rock on with jquery @theodrick it will slow down a bit when you hit bonfires like in zoolander yes, bonfires @theodrick go to the map section of page take a look (not ominous or anything... this is when you really start getting into the challenging aspects) it\\'s safe @jbmartinez  @phajava made me link it yeah, i knew that\\'s what would would happen that calc is making me very uneasy about having to make one... (i\\'ll be like \\'bar has been set pretty high\\') stick with linux updates that you can\\'t opt out (i\\'m talking to you windows 10) totally annoy (and scare) me @theodrick you can do it rock on  specific distros aren\\'t really relative (ubuntu is good for pretty much everything) it\\'s the type of stuff that you install that makes your machine good for programming (technically ubuntu is partially based on debian) @storbeck you\\'ve had a 70% jump in brownies in like 3 days lol ok, like a week storbot no, i was just going by memory  from the other day/week the leaderboard is to me what the calc is to @jbmartinez  yeah, i think you should have a whole cra^ load (from actually contributing to curriculum) oh, that\\'s true i don\\'t think i\\'ve been to the help room  you\\'re going to do those (bonfires) again? no there\\'s more algorithm stuff (so, you would need to (probably) get a foundation in the basic first) imo i re-did those early waypoints because i joined at the cusp of a major update @saintpeter added more, so i\\'ll need to go back (same ocd @jbmartinez has) and do those too ah vb @dueldrawer8 wapoints (i belive) that looks like a guitar <--sits back for long discussion are vienna sausages or potted meat better? yeah totally this is why i\\'m like do i finish the codecademy angular? looks pretty clean that\\'s a broader (or could be) thing... a lot of employers demand (insert whatever here) and that drives a lot of stuff i agree (it\\'s a clue that company doesn\\'t pickup/adapt to new things) yes but you need to evaluate within an array against the other args welcome @mongos134 , @zacqinconel  the gitter emotes are weird... sometimes you can see a short delay in their rendering @quincylarson is there any kind of outreach planned for non-profits (which, granted are not monolithic) to get word out about fcc (like cross quora i guess you\\'d call it) lol @storbeck that\\'s a neat idea... the commercial could have camperbot being tackled by this guy-- *brown, who was signed by the rams earlier this week, stands at 6-foot-10, which is tall even for a lineman, and was said to be about 385 pounds* what\\'s dollar shave club? (no, i don\\'t work for it, whatever \\'it\\' is) lol hang brb to watch/search said item thanks @storbeck , @terakilobyte i love their motto @iheartkode how much of a difference (i.e., are you completely rethinking it, or sort of converting it?) date formatting is nice (but a bit of a pain in js) too ooh, that looks good.  @kimkwanka master calc maker  hey i\\'m just happy that there\\'s something for date/time formatting hi @storbeck  that was totally, unprompted (btw) \\'the people\\' i\\'ve wondered that too, because that pane is filled with irrelevant (imo) stuff they\\'ve been frozen in time @terakilobyte did you ever read omni magazine? i have no idea if it\\'s even still in print... but it was a popular science magazine from the late 1980s it partially updates (the pane) i\\'ve seen newer folks in a couple of the tiles from time to time but its logic or criteria is weird how do you reset history in the left pane? (as long as we\\'re on gitter) @dlomedes anything you need help with? i bet part of that image pane thing is gitter itself, it wasn\\'t designed for a team this size (i.e., there\\'s the team setup where, your team would probably be < 20 people (not >20,000) you\\'re too picky lol yes, must be congruent actually, i haven\\'t seen a lot of people that are on that pane in here i dunno you do? maybe you can\\'t see your own avatar (i don\\'t see it) weird @dlomedes i totally get that.  in fact, i should take my own advice and ask for help more often (but i\\'m more the type to do it for days going *i got this, dam^^*) lol sometimes i switch desktops between kde and gnome... kde\\'s battery widget \\'you\\'ve got (n) minutes left\\' gnome: zero power shutoff that\\'s wrong so wrong\\' yeah, me too....  i can see right away without editor hints or looking up what it says stock boat with whisky and solar panels now i have the styx song in my head that\\'s torture ahhh (actually, i\\'m one of the few people that preferred dennis de young to shaw) @bflatt72 you get brownie points for mentioning joe dirt thanks ooops gotta link your github ok, i\\'ve got styx song in head and i\\'m imagining the mullet (aka joe dirt) bad combo  i\\'m back in the 80s help yeah with the big patch on the back @kimkwanka i caught that when it first came out (i forgot the movie was forthcoming) it was a promo i was rolling i switched to mobile couldn\\'t get link to fire @terakilobyte  weird actually i have to admit that poison is in heavy rotation  sigh yes @quincylarson  javascript was underestimated. crockford\\'s comments about not being a hobby language totally come from late 90s.  yes welcome to debian based disto. now you\\'ll be able to get some work done. lol @storbeck you\\'re just sore about the mailing list for kerkel auto correct sucks  i don\\'t even mess with bsd welcome @gepser  poison you can put windows in a vm apple\\'s terms are tied to hardware. if you somehow get it to work lenovo don\\'t expect stability @qmikew1 is mindless robot microsoft devotes more time on checking your specs at startup than anything else yeah i agree it\\'s the gitter ssd is a great upgrade yeah cage match lol i wouldn\\'t mind the js and node stickers (and even ruby) i\\'m more stickers on the palm rest of laptop.... i just can\\'t get myself to put stickers on the lap cover yeah, the ruby would probably fit perfectly on left of trackpad hi @urobert  they are just tools. totally lol entities are fun yes @jbmartinez i run a script on (source long story) to catch spanish accent chars so i can convert yep lol hi @richacos  welcome @jbmartinez i do it in terminal too (highlights) i post one liner when i get to laptop storbot status check lol you have to convert it there\\'s no loop (also) for your isnot nvm i see where you\\'re calling it @mikebutts congratulations hey, we have similar screen names (except mine doesn\\'t have \\'butt\\' in it) lol turing! status = online (yes, bot overlord) butt? oh, i dropped the s (totally sorry about that) and yes, you\\'re doing great! @jbmartinez passed the turing test long ago  serious bot yeah pretty tree i know @jbmartinez it\\'s weird. @i-petko welcome your noob\\'ness will be short lived.. (going to learn lots) it would be cool if camperbot\\'s (which i\\'m thinking is possible) avatar changed along with its mood lol @awesomeaniruddh it would be neat to change up its (camperbot) appearance once and a while (i\\'m just wondering if in the api, its avatar could be changed based on (n)... but i\\'m thinking no because that would require, login rights ) linter in brackets (which i\\'m guessing is pulling in from node) is sort of a pain... would jshint make life easier? yeah, that is what i was thinking... eslint i\\'ve used (or evaluated) pretty much everything... except atom nice it has a .deb package if i see \\'.deb\\' featured in a page... i\\'m like hmmm (ok, nice) and stickers  yeah, that was a mistake (though i think what they were really saying was \"oh, no it\\'s linux\") i love linux i\\'ve got windows relegated to vm (i do have to use it) that\\'s *nix like though yeah, node was a really easy install... lubuntu has some issues with guest editions i\\'ve found (others disagree though) xubuntu seems to play nice with guest editions (if you want a liter distro) i\\'m not talking metric conversion (never mind spelling) i hear this sometimes about speed, in vm(s) - there\\'s something wrong about config somewhere oh, that\\'s a good idea! (dang another subject taken) lol eat? @lifeburner suggested that i do a setup on openshift and blog about it (sounds like a lot of work in between my lessons) linux vm(s) (or better yet, primary) setups sounds like a lot more fun klingon layout works for me daylight saving (in us) is so weird, it\\'s dark outside already i don\\'t feel like i\\'m saving anything though well yeah that\\'s true but, i don\\'t need it in the morning we\\'re in the same earth sector lol @arielleslie i\\'ve read about the origins (i think at some point) but i just don\\'t get the need yeah, that part i don\\'t like either: (getting dark earlier) totally well, i\\'ve dissed daylight savings time. i feel like i\\'ve accomplished something today darn sommerzeit (now i have a name other than dst to direct my ire ) sommerzeit = easy derailment of node on linux vs. windows convo (sorry) welcome @kulinp   wait, there\\'s a big casino gambler? js really shed its browser confines (hard to grasp from late 90s perspective ) @lfried-ndd welcome i\\'m going to have product placement in my portfolio.  companies pay you if you have cheese wiz strategically placed in frame vb6 i had to get over the hobby language rep. that totally messes with grasping philosophy  we\\'re no slouches in production (u.s. ) doing nothing brings the most regret i\\'m on mobile. no deep philosophical chat. one liners for me. lol took me a minute to read that as quote  nice @paulduncan21 best advice: start it serves pizza you have to invoke the the hal easter eggs full? is that a trident? i\\'m on a small screen but it looks like somebody riding s dolphin sorry i couldn\\'t answer your email. this thing called gitter sucked the life from my battery lol need > i don\\'t think it\\'s browser k is prompting me for login i do missing \" follow the example syntax code isn\\'t reponsive on mobile. that sucks. i get half blocks. gitter th a n ks well you must be using hexchat @abhisekp lol the classic \"person entered room\" irc thing i don\\'t know am on mobile while booting my machine. i\\'m considering an irc client if it\\'s fast @abhisekp i might give it a go @rolandisimo try username (vs. user) in your connection string if we go hindi only i\\'ll have to pay google for their translation api just to chat lol @kprenesti those aren\\'t the only chars you need to filter out @kprenesti regex is the stumbling block you\\'re encoutering. try http://www.regexr.com/\\nexperiment a little (read the tips in left pane). you\\'re not capturing everything also, [\\\\,] (isn\\'t a good pattern for a number of reasons) and will only capture , @kprenesti we all have our kriptonite  angular is hard (i\\'m on the fence because, i sense \\'a change ah comin\\' (react) about delving deeper into codecademy\\'s lesson) @catapixel is it pretty far out (not the 60s term) then? for implementation i don\\'t think learning angular (in its current iteration) is a waste...  stuff changes a lot (might as well get used to it) @kprenesti tip: you can overwrite the default text in regexr and test with your own. you can experiment with + (your question) but you may want to familiarize with \\\\w you can sort of see what\\'s in (as well as referencing it) by https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js i blame you (all) for forgetting i had yogurt (not the greatest thing warm) lol @jbmartinez i have the terminal one-liner (and went further for regex (which is probably more helpful) to detect spanish chars ```\\n//spanish accent chars\\n//these are one-liners i\\'ve used (pulled from net)\\n//in terminal you can do: grep --color=\\'auto\\' -p -n \"[\\\\x80-\\\\xff]\" yourfile.txt\\n//(to highlight)\\n//in regex\\n/[\\\\u00e0-\\\\u00fc]/g\\n//will capture\\n//á, é, í, ó, ú, ü, ñ\\n``` oh, item 6000 read the sass preamble (on the ever growing list of things to do) hash with number invokes the gitter bug tracker (oops) issue not found lol @sangsatori yes, it will suck all productivity from your soul why are solutions even viewable?

(because you could have keys for decryption to those you define as \\'folks authorized to view\\') @abhisekp i see what you\\'re talking about (more of a no-sql, approach and firebase specific) a group of radio buttons (properly id allows one sellection i made the mistake of trying to answer a question on mobile... let\\'s do this again @msd1391 \\nradio buttons (when setup properly) allow a single selection (like do you want apples, oranges, or potatoes?) check box allows multiple checks  @msd1391 \\n```\\nselection purposes\\n\\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_checkbox_name.asp\\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_doc_getelementsbyname.asp\\n\\n<!--\\nvar x = document.getelementbyid(\"mycheck\").name;\\n- or -\\nvar x = document.getelementsbyname(\"fname\");\\n-->\\n``` indiana jones and the temple of dom also, too...you\\'d lose the ability to group radio buttons into a logical set (i.e., where one is checked others can\\'t be ... without id or name etc., the question would be which buttons? where? i like brackets  and geany  @iheartkode i know your tutorial link was just an evil plan to make me learn ruby welcome @emjayess  sublime is fast there are a lot of tools (for whatever insert here)... i don\\'t spend a lot of time dissing (unless it\\'s windows lol... but still use it because i have to) because you should use whatever you need to get the job done... install all the editors ! snake case sss your handle must be the same @iheartkode it pops up in rails forum first ranking lol well no follow for you @iheartkode  lol that\\'s the point, i don\\'t even use twitter or facebook (i know right?) thinking about it though @iheartkode , i will let you and @jbmartinez know...

(they have signature arrows) separate those (classes) by spaces @hungrysteven only a few more, and you have numeric palindrome @abhisekp  thanks @abhisekp  (now it\\'s +3) @urobert nothing wrong  with taking a break and regrouping  something has to === 0 in your if statement you\\'re not comparing something, in its current form @mrankins  lol go for the \\'break and regroup\\' string: \"heads\" and \"tails\" not heads (because you haven\\'t defined anything) so it would be \"heads\" as string is flip what you should be comparing? (been awhile since i was on that) it is it\\'s a variable name that is a number np @mrankins it will come to you (i promise) wait until you get to the bonfires\\n well, let\\'s just say you\\'re not cooking marshmallows (you are the marshmallow) lol no, they are practice whatever pace you\\'re most comfortable... do it. (and you can always ask questions) yeah, the community here is really great (it sets fcc apart (aside from the hard skills aspect which it has as well)) i signed up with codecademy (what seems like eons ago, well before fcc) but there\\'s a motivation piece (as well as sort of disparate technologies to learn)) that\\'s missing yeah, codecademy is still good as a secondary reinforcement ( @arielleslie makes a good point) repetition... there\\'s no way you\\'re going to get nuances (or even straight forward stuff) without doing @mrankins there have been some changes, but i see that you probably need to read up (and experiment) with/on regex http://www.regexr.com/ @bflatt72 there aren\\'t a lot of ror haters (in fact, if you read some blogs etc., you\\'ll find that-that was what a lot of folks may have moved from to create fcc (have no unique insight or anything)) so, that gives me some indication on javascript and its place in comparison  @mrankins break it up into chunks (and maybe make tiny milestones etc., for example: mess around with the regex sites and experiment, then reward yourself etc.) then go on to the next thing... or (and) do some reading (eloquent js e.g.,) or (and) reinforce the js aspect with codecademny @mrankins if you want to learn regex from a lesson perspective ( @abhisekp \\'s video link is good as well) you can try: http://regexone.com/ then do your own experimentation with http://www.regexr.com/ (there are tips in the left pane) ok, i\\'ve done enough *serious typing* i\\'m ready to talk about cheese dip again @qmikew1 wishes velveeta was more economical @econ17 welcome (and as a side effect you can, now , tell when the engineers are bs\\'ng you) i want to try node-sass thought? s uh, huh.... business is business is node-sass bad? (like nobody comments as if it were some horrible disease that\\'s associated with folklore) when in doubt, npm\\' it nc weather is all over the place find cbot find gitterbot  welcome @mlosa001  came up in an audit, so @jbmartinez had to start over turn your speakers down if you do the frequency pen on that codevember lol i dunno, life by \\'the collective\\' (polls) sound f\\' up to me lol hey, what color shirt should i wear? (fill in poll) (yes, absurd (but not really) extreme) lol hello @nikolaisaganenko  no yes, it\\'s a great curriculum  i\\'m hearing love boat theme in alternate languages for some reason lol it\\'s advanced ai storbot that is we programmed modesty into the storbot they couldn\\'t have chosen a better song (by the pixies) for the ending wow i am jealous i could do that i had a flashback seeing the joust game if they only had star castle lol.... i just noticed the themed drinks sadly i never envisioned gen-x being aarp candidates it will be filled with oatmeal i\\'m just waiting for my discounts true, and 400-800 years it will be the same for those folks maybe earth will be a vacation spot for squid people by then (you never know) i know kung fu! show me they might take zoolander for reality and send the fleet i have to read the fermi paradox that would work only thing, is it\\'s theory based on a small sample  when the squid people come, they will disagree welcome @btbinhtran  philosophically (if you were taking the perspective of other species on this planet) we may well be the squid people.  we find stuff in very deep parts of the ocean that we didn\\'t know existed...(based on our known observational knowledge) so, we couldn\\'t predict that we would find those not so much, we know that dinosaurs had a life cycle --of course--(not because) we observed it (but based on carbon dating, clues about environment etc.)  jsx ah, xml again (not a xml hater) yeah, have to wrangle that stuff you missed jsx is react easier to learn than (well, you know) @jbmartinez i still have to look (slightly off topic) at your pure-sass so, react is more js in its  \\'ways\\' ? yeah, why are they doing that? but there are legacy issues with javascript because of their influence (if you agree/believe crockford and others) on ecma in the early days,   could typescript be to  angular, the same thing? they\\'re going to have homegrown angular.... but i think it\\'s still codeschool for now (but i skipped to codecademy for that) weird the regex needs to be tweaked a bit (i mean c o n tr o ll er s are going to come up a lot in angular convos) browser cache? it would have to be trollololol http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html\\n*xml has the benefit of balanced opening and closing tags. this helps make large trees easier to read than function calls or object literals.* @jbmartinez ^ ?? hey, dude people trying to help.... mind the trolling invective(s)  i don\\'t know who i\\'m talking to lol @bwieland86 we were talking about camperbot and its regex with regard to \\'con tro ller\\' when? (react)  @quincylarson i\\'m kind of on the fence about committing to learning angular (react just seems to be on the horizon for everything)... i\\'ve gotten a lot of good feedback for learning both etc., but i\\'m like hmm  hi @bruglesco  sure (tip they\\'re usually separated by spaces)... can you paste your code? @eniergray  yeah take out \"\" between smaller-image and thick-green-border rock on  @eniergray get used to it (everybody racks their brains on some simple syntax thing) welcome @katwalla  taking notes, etc. (ever vigilant bot) i can\\'t judge the merits but red flags go up whenever i see \\'seamless upgrade\\' what am i getting points for again? oh, i see lol you\\'re absolved go forth and procrastinate no more  i had to bale on that article on about the 4th paragraph, as it seems to be arguing for less innovation and more structured vis-a-vis (programmers aren\\'t professionals etc.)   licensing/education like \\'engineers\\' ducatti? honda (there was a naked model bike) lol that\\'s a keeper quote @quincylarson  did you try it in brackets? well, the clickbate worked i\\'m reading the article lol maybe \"why do programmers over complicate things?\" i\\'d read that i\\'m learning that but functions have scope (or all scope is in function right?) lol they will mock you just saying so is kind of \\'how shall i say it\\' mean yeah, they are sharp as f over there.... (some of the answers on so) yes, devalue the currency all in one paragraph lol lentils and fried chicken bottom part is chicken it\\'s supposed to be serenity yeah, i would be too @abhisekp  i was going to say hello, but the wall of code no, i\\'m just kidding @mattmun  @jedpimentel i promise i don\\'t have any decals affixed to me you need some regex there http://www.regexr.com/ @abhisekp i\\'m going to bookmark that (and see what kind of answers you get) yeah, i saw that... it was almost instant @abhisekp oh, so that\\'s how they do that yeah i\\'m not seeing it yet holy cow are you still messing with that @abhisekp ? you are determined lol darn i would look but have limited scroll on mobile gitter yeah i noted that too  and found no back tick on mobile. great epiphany: jshint will likely make things easier for me than standard is it better? that i like i\\'ll look at that (have to switch to laptop before pulling my hair out) @terakilobyte so, i got the .eslintrc file off the main repo. is this, in essence, a config file for eslint?   \"\" why do you want to define an empty string? (other than avoiding, perhaps, \\'undefined\\') it\\'s almost 3:00am here, don\\'t mind me  serenity  i was going to make it \"serenity through code\" but it wouldn\\'t fit  lol nice to meet you as well @dbzdxw  @amgranad this is very javascript intensive you will learn a lot  nice thanks @terakilobyte and @abhisekp ... yeah, good catch... i didn\\'t look to see if there were any other file references in the config. so, it looks like there\\'s a npm for eslint for cli....so, i could invoke (with reference to config) the linter on a .js file  i swill coffee like a fiend wait, iced coffee is coffee oh, milk and sugar? there was a tasty iced-coffee (well, iced cappuccino) made by a company called ito-en (don\\'t know if it\\'s still around)  i can only drink sweetened coffee if it\\'s cold.... weird is c9 cra^^y it looks good  @abhisekp does brackets pull linter info from node itself (i.e., i\\'m wondering if i could tweak this eslint into brackets via node for real-time (if upon save is real time and all)? \"why would you do that?\" why not? lol i just spent some amount of time reading up on this they should i guess you can sanitize based on *known* patterns...but that\\'s the problem you can sanitize strings to strip out tags and (sql related stuff, which is an entirely different discussion @jbmartinez ) it\\'s a good site for regex, yes. (and you\\'re interested in regex.. that\\'s great!) - (you see a lot of \"i just want to get past this exercise\" stuff) predefined choices  oh, i forgot about that i always have problems with twitch my eye twitches when i use it but i don\\'t think that\\'s the intended effect seriously though, it\\'s not the most performant why not ask for review before you actually create it?  welcome @infinityxcx  @faizaanceg oh, i see you\\'re looking for actual review from maintainer  yeah, even with formatted lol @jbmartinez camperbot *can* read your thoughts: it\\'s pulling from the uri geller api it knows you were going to say that i think you get bot-overlord brownie points when you compliment it when you insult it (bot overlord)... it adds an extra 20 minutes to whatever you\\'re cooking in the microwave now you know lol i\\'ve never heard \\'chipping away that which is not david (or similiar)\\' used in programming context... yes, grow the unix beard lol hi @dukbcaaj  btw (the *nix admin look is great) @jedpimentel that is ( @dukbcaaj is probably thinking what the hey, hey as i interjected a hello mid paragraph) lol does rogaine work on your face too? talking about rogaine @groundxaero  hello nuqneh (one of the very few advantages bing has over google: it translates klingon) i got that from @jbmartinez so he is (total) nerd lol @jedpimentel i worry that the intended effect isn\\'t precise.

custom scripts? i may have to cut my teeth on grunt or gulp (as a learning thing (not for production)) before i get to the tweaking aspects @michael-krebs nice (the concept is familiar with bash scripting on linux) i\\'m seeing what you\\'re saying @ericelliott https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts in terms of stripping away stuff and getting to cheerio looks interesting (sorry, side reading the links) i think one of the key ingredients to being a good programmer is the perspective: \"what am i doing wrong\"? --i see the opposite with bugs reports (all that fun stuff to the right)  (\"my test failed, must be a bug\")   yeah, the npm scripts thing kind of clicked just now (though, i will learn the hard way with grunt or gulp to figure out just why...) if you\\'re doing a sort remember that default behavior is lexigraphical np it may or may not help with this particular exercise but sometimes you\\'ll get unexpected results if you\\'re sorting numbers without knowing that hey, ! cbot where\\'s my brownie camperbot is just sore about the sweat stained t-shirt comment and is now stealing my brownies yeah @khaduch compound declarations with a single var is neat (other langs have this too)... the only thing (and this is entirely preference) is if you have all kinds of types (yes, there\\'s loose to no typing) it might be easier on the eyes to group those with with blocks on separate lines... maybe just me yeah, especially when vision begins to go @invisigram \\n```\\nfunction justsomefunction(){\\nvar z = 5\\n\\nfor (var i = 0; i < z; i++){\\n     var q = \"b\";\\n    console.log(\"just random stuff\");\\n}\\n    console.log(\"i am q\\'s value: \" + q);\\n}\\n\\njustsomefunction();\\n\\n//displays:\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff                                                                       \\n//i am q\\'s value: b\\n``` yeah, it\\'s totally a preference thing @invisigram i forgot to add... that q is available to the function... but if i tried to use it with another function it wouldn\\'t work (good)... your question about global as @jbmartinez said would be to omit the var and like he said (that would be bad) it could be used globally  as an aside, i\\'m still trying to digest closures... so am no guru i saw on the fcc twitch (ok, i replayed it on youtube) that there\\'s going to be a job board (where folks can apply based on 1. front end cert , 2. full-stack (or both)) it\\'s in production? did i click some ancient link like hey, i heard of this new thing called the internet (late to the game type of thing) oh, well.... sounds neat either way (even if i\\'m the last person to have heard of it) no comfy solace can be found with unplugging and cuddling up with a windows 98 machine. stuff changes lol welcome and howdy @blacknight318  i was totally second guessing the link i clicked, i blame @jbmartinez  lol welcome @emmy12345  @sarahdlc \\n```\\n<!--generic application:\\n1. create the class\\n2. specify stuff\\n3. reference it in the element specified\\n-->\\n<style>\\n<!-- 1. ===v -->\\n.theclassnameyoumade{\\n<!-- 2. ===v -->\\n\\twidth: 575px;\\n}\\n</style>\\n\\n<img class =\"theclassnameyoumade\" src=\"https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat\">\\n<!--3 =======^ -->\\n```\\n awesome you will be challenged though  type colon.. and select from drop did you login with github?

oh, nice... you must have pro version of codepen is it worth it for the pairing aspect? i forgot, about the resume linkage aspects so, the pro thing makes sense (in addition to the pairing) np @sarahdlc  yeah, the asset uploads is really a big sell i\\'d do it for just that @emmy12345 goto the wrench and screwdriver icon ... then click notifications .... then select/tweak to your liking the visualizer idea reminds me of this skinable windows media player back in the day. can\\'t remember its name yeah! that\\'s pretty cool (am in mobile)  you\\'ve got your own domain nice lobe it too (ear pun music app and all) that would be nice i\\'d say do it on something other than phone i\\'m chatting from phone and it\\'s less than ideal (coding on it would make me barf) that\\'s it play hard to get until spotify ups the offer. lol itunes has become a serious pita yeah, i think that\\'s what\\'s starting happen is it blocked for currency ? @jbmartinez i think that multiplies (whatever their intended) effect @carten congrats.  i saw that (cheerio) on link from earlier are there good (yes ff has some built in) mobile simulators ? it helps going to the 80s bar? got it. saw blazer yep @el-sloth86 welcome feels weird saying hello to a sloth  just language dissonance on my part lol howdy @bruglesco  which? i often wonder if there\\'s some daemon in gitter (due to the weird lags) that\\'s doing some kind of process mgmt lol that so link took me on a journey  stack overflow  i think what prompted the question was async and defer i wish ie8 would go somewhere and... the spartan\\'s defensive formation is certainly applicable to microsoft  bye @el-sloth86  lol wordpress and php was what he was advocating i think you have a numeric palindrome  e e it\\'s been out longer than that same here on my vm are you talking about drawing in svg (i.e, manipulating values for animation like stuff ) that\\'s cool stuff huh? no way (held hostage by raster) no really it wasn\\'t  but i do work with svg sometimes in simple context i\\'ve got so much on my list now. cheerio, grunt, sass , svg, doing my actual curriculum requirements. lol what\\'s sad about that troll is he/she lost out (based on their sheer stupidity) on a chance to kearn learn not font actions in printing lol and incoherent  there are city/location meet ups.  if there isn\\'t one in your area. i think you\\'re encouraged to start your own.  start the vacuum of space coffee and code lol although depressurization is always a concern and can be discouraging what am i being thanked for again?  oh, check yes, and free toaster getting closer oh, no problem @emmy12345  @kimkwanka wow i swear @kimkwanka is far across the ocean in germany @emmy12345 bonfires are where you begin to meet  more challenging exercises (with javascript)  me and @jbmartinez are geezers. we should play checkers together lol lol playonlinux is a nice front-end for wine (just random  thought ) @abhisekp you can\\'t have that or meat lol @kimkwanka you did another hackintosh? you\\'re addicted @tanasic i would google for bootstrap alternatives (foundation etc., ) what do you mean by manual responsiveness?  you can still do that in css even if you have bootstrap referenced bye @kimkwanka  it\\'s now cold in nc yesterday it was hot.  @pasportit i can deal (just wish there was some cosistent pattern) must download @storbeck \\'s essense it\\'s very possible, but be careful (on the side languages can build up fast, and maybe cause confusion) same here in fact, that\\'s very apropos for my monday  hiya @latebloomer  if you pay attention (to comments, summits and the like) react is coming (don\\'t know when) @saintpeter i saw a brief walk through (you tube) from yesterday.  what is it exactly? (o\\' mastic) matic @saintpeter oh, see. so, this will (in essense) enable quicker content delivery (which makes sense by its namesake ) i looked at the example (though in mobile atm) i can see how that would be true  heya @agoalofalife  @milpool welcome your days (with high probability) of sucking at js are over  there\\'s a cra^load of js instruction (in a good way) and exercises it (the exercises) give you some context on where/how to apply it please make it responsive (try using chrome\\'s request desktop feature-- you have to do a hard restart to reset) is this a running commentary on the regex fixes that need to be done i\\'m pretty sure mondays (even if in your country they\\'re called something else) universally suck i wonder if the strings could be put into a queue for evaluation (would probably be really non-performant) to fire multiple commands (late night thoughts on cbot) hiya @detchison  ^the first try at the percentage sign in early history  many arguments where had about the number of circles the ones with sour cream flavor ? they leave a film of oil that gets on keyboard but not as bad as cheetos i\\'m not following (but i\\'m guessing you\\'re troubleshooting a pen) the whisky may affect learning retention good evening people is good too that totally fooled me (i\\'m like what\\'s the glitch) now you have to un-stick it in your head can you paste your code? was that an errant th a n ks @dcsan ? lol oh, it was a test \"t h a nks\"  @dcsan does camperbot still pull the same from the wiki aspect (i.e., since it\\'s (wiki) been moved (because of issues with public) to its own pr setup) @abhisekp  oh i see the sync aspect (just a change on one side ) yeah that\\'s kind of cool (side effect) you could edit locally angular taunts me why not just drop the name from 2.0 new official build name angularreactingtoreact @jbmartinez that blog cuts right to the nub yeah but look at the blog too it was the storbot i have to look at it in laptop @jbmartinez (weather example) probably why my results are different never noticed the shadow in logo yeah how easy (or difficult) would it be to implement a site status feature @jarlinton welcome  @combsco kind of (those are some cool metrics) but i\\'m not sure some of the stuff could be pulled automatically (i.e, there\\'s some manual interaction between report and identification e.g., bonfire, zip line sub) wall of wiki welcome @paulduncan21  i am not an android (can\\'t vouch for others) see,  sup @kimkwanka  no just ready to take in monday on but your hackintosh adventure does have me curious yeah i\\'m more linux but i don\\'t discount stuff don\\'t be @jazzthespazz  am on mobile (scroll challenged) why the multiple jquery references @tesla809  those are loaded sequentially and are redundant. but i get what you\\'re saying oh no, it is monday    good morning yeah, what\\'s the question? litigious society  @qmikew1 watches battery drain @rya-prajapati what kind of issues are you running into? was that a tumbleweed that just rolled by welcome @rpeleias (late reply but still...) so, i\\'m a linux user but have some windows vms. anybody have any issues with iso install on win10? welcome @sparvata  hey @jbmartinez did you do in-place or iso? (or, have you done it yet (remember you mentioning) i\\'m not excited, but might as well... did you need help @jamierez  (or do)?? cool why not put quotes around @urobert you should be able to access it by adding quotes... but if this is what you\\'re after:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13693580/how-to-make-a-document-getelementbyid-value-into-an-integer-variable-not-a-stri may or may not be helpful yeah, so the quotes around should return ... right (or am i missing something) @urobert do you have this in a pen (so all can take a look)? @urobert don\\'t know if it\\'s applicable or not, but you may need to use parseint() on that (because it returns a string) --i could be wrong as it may coerce and such...but\\n```\\nvar time = document.getelementbyid(\"sessiontime\").textcontent;\\nconsole.log(time);\\nconsole.log(typeof(time));\\n\\n//displays\\n25 (index):25\\nstring \\n``` yeah, i figured js would figure out for you what to \\'type\\' it as. brownies to @storbeck thanks (from urobert x2) see, you can \\'brownie on behalf\\' nope, camperbot has determined that you can only help once... so, if you have a compound issue.. you\\'re sol lol heya @rpeleias  go webased @misslea  https://repl.it/languages if you want to do it locally, node.js is good @iancolenutt there\\'s a \\'sign in with github\\' button on the main fcc page...

i didn\\'t either @groundxaero until a discussion on here about it i igor wanting to learn fortran for legacy banking app.  wish me luck ty @storbeck  i know this cobol the implement stuff out and ahead  they i like ff btw will i get linux beard if i click that link you must be doing the calc project i like the blue led segment font there is more punctuation to deal with @groundxaero it\\'s cool pen for some reason i\\'m craving one of those nasty costco (or sam\\'s club) lasagana(s) that\\'s what powers ie (it\\'s totally fart compliant) \"we\\'re a ms shop\" \"how do you feel about that?  oh that\\'s really cool (hey, can be a sellout if need be) yeah i actually like ms\\' database stuff (unrelated) mono in wine is a pita it\\'s a dependency for some stuff  so the app that would run in wine is using a mono dependecy layer @storbeck i\\'m talking about what app that runs in wine may have to use (not directly mono because of its linux ness) to https://www.linux.com/learn/answers/view/910-i-have-just-switched-from-win7-to-zorin-ubuntu-i-have-been-working-with-an-ai-program-called-verbot-for-awhile-and-my-question-is-how-do-i-run-it-and-net-framework-on-zorin-please-help  doesn\\'t matter anyway. if i need to do ms stuff i just fire up a windows vm (some stuff is sketchy ) that\\'s the spirit! git in non dev contexts would make world happier place (concept wise) i\\'m a git noob i\\'m afraid i will be shamed on a pr  like some response like \"no you tard your revision sucks and is rejected\" this is what i fear is tard or sucks omitted? i\\'m just sayin what every noob is thinking  we have revolution now is by far the winner on comment i will commit (no pun intended) to some req in next two weeks hopefully not on a repo whose maintainers are not in the midst of revolution   the psychology aspect i think should be covered with git use neck bolts on it just kidding can you paste your code @josebarakat  and electricity  i\\'m all about being up front with my dev related insecurities. maybe be the anne landers if medium of your reflex needs to account for all punctuation inducated regex indicated (mobile auto suggest grrr) \\\\w will not catch it all (a lot but not all) use regexr to test it\\'s hackish but | can be used in pattern it\\'s an or operator but not the best way.  well i\\'m just giving you a hint because i want you to solve on your own tiles? looks like tiles i don\\'t either @decocode welcome @storbeck are you and @terakilobyte going to make a new zipline already in the hopper? cool beans you pay a crapload for one  yep you can use an express version of mssql 10gb i think for free download the express version you can use addons (don\\'t know about latest version) learn both @thec0mposer aren\\'t you supposed to be learning full stack (which in this case is more of no-sql approach ) lol @azlorenzolopez hello, welcome check nice. congrats @pdewouters  that is cool @progmacattack i think i remember the pen that went with that most people help others independent of brownie points. there are quirks in the method (e.g, saying hello should not garner a point of some kind) but the community is actually pretty nice and wants others to do well it sets fcc apart imo camperbot isn\\'t sentient @n832sv i think if you\\'re questioning motivation (in a metaphysical context) @storbeck actually contributed to the curriculum and didn\\'t have any \\'points\\' until very recently so yeah with qualifiers  not that that\\'s bad or anything (question in itself ) make sure node is up to date or it will b^^^^ about versioning conflicts with npm (this is what happened to me with a stale ubuntu version ) that\\'s a good idea you also need to return the var ok i\\'m on mobile (can\\'t scroll ) but i thought i saw 0 in return. you may want to return the var (the calculation assigned to ) and return that  it looks nice (and might find niche bc words joy and hr aren\\'t usually seen together) nc nothing but rain all the time. like seattle sans the cool factor  there are a lot of people from nc. they just don\\'t admit it.  wait, i\\'m not supposed to use semicolons? i do after every var and return not so much to end functions though  sounds like a medium article just begging to be written how is js minified (not the tools per se) got it so it\\'s just removing a lot of readability cra^ for humans. (smaller file size i guess ) is there really a gain in performance that\\'s definately a factor i can see that with compression  that\\'s interesting jquery cdn gives both options min vs etc some jquery video got me started on this i\\'ve been wanting to experiment with materialize-css it looks nice out of the box still experiencing issues with that ? (can understand the frustration ) @bwieland86 i remember this from the other day. did you try touching base with codeschool help? so you\\'re in sort of a bureaucratic limbo with codeschool. that sucks codecademy has an angular course if you want to practice while waiting for codeschool response i have completed it though havent codepen is a separate setup issue independent of both though @bwieland86 what you may want to do is search pens tagged with free code camp. there should be a lot of example in how folks have incorporated angular examples  there are proprietary webkits that vary by browser  extensions to standard and the like totally confusing i know that we have to build stuff that\\'s responsive; however, i find even really well done stuff a pita to use in mobile totally you can feel that sometimes hiya @nicky171  @storbeck do they have people in teams (generic terms) that are supposed to do mobile and others traditional? only rather in general dev shop it might be better to go smaller rather than get locked into one or the other sans the app dev i don\\'t know i guess it\\'s good to know all bc larry (or insert gender neutral name) the mobile guy could be out on sick leave @danielrob your sounds like a good working vibe yours i think the size (as stated) and really the type (maybe even more importantly) of org drives that it would be neat to have a dev centric survey (satusifaction) broken down by employee size and stuff (an and mobile si spelling is out) see? on mobile and totally incoherent lol welcome @rosandoval  welcome @iliyaj (if it makes you feel any better i had vb6 on a machine at one time) welcome @gold-rims  there are a lot of folks willing to assist. feel free to ask questions if you get stuck what are you stuck on, @soumyarauth ? @soumyarauth you may want to paste your code (what you have so far) and folks will give you help/feedback explain format welcome @blackbond007  what kind of coding did you used to do ? nice. this is definately a good place to either brush-up/expand/or learn from scratch, javascript @blackbond007  @amarchhetri the quotes work, and are passed to twitter.... looks good @blackbond007 what\\'s this? you don\\'t find re-imaging boxes and dealing with *\"challenging\"* support questions to be satisfying? heresy. lol not in tech support, but have a good idea what it\\'s about @dxmartin8  that\\'s a valid pattern for space; however, you need to account for punctuation try http://www.regexr.com/ and experiment (there are tips in the left pane) @dxmartin8 can you paste what you have so far? @dxmartin8 so, apply what @arielleslie showed you... -and- read up a bit on regex...(because of the punctuation thing) and you should be good to go i would be cool to make an actual slice of pizza stand on its end like that. @urobert do you have a code example? can you elaborate? @urobert it\\'s your test the value was pulled from a string (even though it looks like a number) and you\\'re evaluating against a string hang on a second... @urobert we all know about the lack of typing in js but i\\'m convinced that since you pulled that value as text it\\'s affecting your (if condition)....example:\\n```\\nvar i = \"0\";\\n//^===exercise in \\'stringness\\'\\n//and test if value will be coerced\\nif (i === 0){\\n    console.log(\"i\\'ve been coerced into a number\");\\n//this won\\'t happen by the way\\n    \\n} \\n\\nvar q = 0;\\n\\nif (q === 0){\\n    console.log(\"i am indeed a number\");\\n}\\n\\n//v========this part is (what i think you need)\\nvar x = parseint(i);\\n\\nif (x === 0){\\n    console.log(\"i\\'ve been converted to a number\");\\n} else {\\n    console.log(\"i\\'m totally wrong\") \\n}\\n```\\n i could be totally wrong as well (keep that in mind too, @urobert ) lol totally the opposite (learning style). give me a high-level overview and some applied examples and am good... gaming thing drives me crazy @rchipman yeah, i\\'ve been meaning to check that out @zaixeno you won\\'t...(and we don\\'t mostly)... it\\'s totally about repetition  yeah go through the bashing-your-head-against-machine (not literally ) phase...it means you\\'re making some progress eloquent is good you might want to use an additional processing array to grab (and process) stuff using substring and .push @goletian https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/refresh-your-browser-cache (incognito tab will probably do it (i.e., fix) though) http://www.techrepublic.com/article/multidimensional-arrays-in-javascript/ when arrays get too complex my brain stops processing (those) camperbot is love it\\'s already sentient congrats @yuyao17  welcome @jbmartinez  javascript ist besser als erdnussbutter nein wirklich [0]  not )0)  @shingocr  ```[0]``` i mean ```[0],[1],[2]``` respectively  the brackets are important camperbot ist fühl i wonder what the logic (i.e., to make one lose lots) is on real slot machines high probability echo test it works ok, did you get the echo out your systems? lol if not, i can sit here and watch camperbot say things like a bad ventriloquist dummy there\\'s always a feeling of unease when learning we all have it trust me @doppelhertz it will come to you when you want to build something. you will not sleep until you find the answer sure @disj2k4  how are you going to see it? was there a change in wapoint (what waypoint is this?) that looks new... (it\\'s been awhile, but i don\\'t remember this) or, my memory (as well as soul) has been taken by \\'the camperbot\\' oh, it\\'s trivial... sure.  but i have this weird attachment to remembering things helps when ordering food. \"may i help you\"? \"um, yeah.... i uh, was going to order, um....something\" which, oddly enough, is always the person in front of me you just say \"i\\'ll have my people call you with that information\".... they\\'ll be like wow doesn\\'t have the same gravitas  and won\\'t work hi @brahiansoto  standing by @perroudsan welcome @jazzthespazz would this be all shopping? @dxmartin8 missed your code. what do you have so far ? echo yes so, you need to remove all punctuation..... where\\'s you actual code? your not the test what you\\'re applying in terms of logic (i.e., your code) you\\'re only accounting for period and comma @dxmartin8 i would go to http://www.regexr.com/ and review. you can overwrite the default text there and experiment with patterns. just a couple of hints , there\\'s spaces, colons and all kinds of other stuff in that string (which if i remember is the last test ) i wonder why it\\'s couching its references in near (to eye) 0o characters looks like bad code (in intent and in execution)  looks like pretty simple logic applied to key events and it\\'s declaring new activex object (ie\\'s version of a java applet) so, i wouldn\\'t dig it too much (in many ways other than its microsoft\\'ish\\'ness) but maybe i\\'m reading too much into it... @zaixeno seems to be pretty smitten with it (i\\'m imagining the quest to figure it out) i think you keep network admins up at night lol yes, the first is not a valid regex pattern there was a switch, i remember there being a regex lesson. fcc used to link to: http://regexone.com/ regex is difficult (and probably a lot of people just want to get through it to move on to something else) but it\\'s really powerful. that\\'s a takeoff on \"i\\'m washing my hair\" don\\'t feel that way you have to do some additional reading/videos. etc yep, good site he is, he had to buy a special keyboard cover and everything i can\\'t believe a bot has points pay attention to @storbeck \\'s critique... that\\'s what consumers of apps actually do...  or sites/services etc. doesn\\'t work, next type of thing i think you\\'re right i mean if i clicked on some tarot reading site (not mentioning names or links posted) and it wasn\\'t actively stealing my data or showing me half-baked stuff.. i\\'d say \\'next\\' good instincts lol when i log via mobile one of my suggested rooms is vietnam / ruby (nothing wrong with either) chat. they sure got me pegged.  in it\\'s better to paste/format code (vs image) there\\'s no upper bound - so, you would have no range with an empty var @jbmartinez guten morgen i don\\'t get the enticement thing (with a lot of the, purely, code challenge based sites): that doesn\\'t give employers relevant info to base chance of an offer  @lizardking93 you don\\'t need to wrap in a function @lizardking93 the test isn\\'t looking for a return value (from a function) it wants you to apply .reverse() to what it\\'s asking (being vague for instructional purposes) an employer (that\\'s worth its salt) will ask you what your approach would be to an actual problem  that they have pre-screening is cool... but it\\'s not the whole picture me either (gaming challenge sites), they\\'re too busy with visuals and all kinds of irrelevant (yes, i know it\\'s gaming and all) stuff http://eloquentjavascript.net/ np it\\'s a good read nerd detour... there\\'s this music in the star wars franchise (no, not the imperial march) that just tugs at me (usually during some sappy portion) by the time a university creates a class about something, it\\'s already irrelevant (or on its way)...of course not fundamentals and stuff...  what\\'s a pferd? in hindi? wait, brb hey, wait a minute horse is ghōṛā horses are cool horses are like javascript, they sometimes kick or bite you ghōṛā that\\'s good this has the flavor of the monk and david carridine in the kung fu series i was too; however, you can\\'t beat japanese series stuff from the late 1960s no, but that\\'s good too lol the robot stuff came in the early 1970s you love jackie chan. admit it got the t-shirt, no? coffee mug jackie chan matching curtains and bathroom rug the bruce lee face was the best drunk master was a good movie drunken yeah, that marked the end of cred i only recently heard about ip man... and was like wow when i saw some clips kung pao with the matrix effect cow was interesting i don\\'t get the chuck norris thing yeah, i\\'m a nerd and (in fact watched the 1980s? series) but just don\\'t get it but if something is relevant to your experience it has more of a chance of being funny. i would dare say that most folks these days have never watched anything by chuck norris the 80s were a little dicey in terms of music. a lot of great stuff... others, not so much welcome @bgottschling  morning @terakilobyte  @karthic2914 is this an exercise or a codepen? no pressure or anything @codewingx lol but there\\'s no value  avatars look weird when scaled down i\\'m svg i scale without distortion (nerd affirmation booklet) page 31 light without heat oh, that was steve vai yeah but metal is all about distortion (sound)  so, you\\'d end up with disgruntled fans welcome @michellevnl  i would throw some more stuff in there @chethanbhat  there is a certain elegance in minimalism, but this strikes me as something is missing  or the load cost i use both but feel guilt there goes the aarp gig welcome @robertdgee  that\\'s what radio buttons are (a *single* selection in a group) cool. welcome @johnnyyossarian   i have to admit i\\'m curious about odin project  hello @stevothecoder   that\\'s the spirit  welcome @spydersteve  if uav cam deliver ramen i\\'m sold can ramen in a jiffy will be the front end app ramen doesn\\'t have all the logistical overhead choose a database vendor first. learn how to admin said db (permissions, user mgmt, view s). before even making it web facing @evaristoc just caught the tail end @evaristoc no, i just remember some results that were forthcoming on a project saw your tag a couple of lines up. wondering if the results were out (i.e., interested to take a peek) questions are good @bluehanded  i haven\\'t been over to data science in awhile (or other rooms) low activity and such so, i\\'m looking at https://github.com/evaristoc which one is it? yeah just a bit i didn\\'t even know they were still around @edg570 but you\\'re using a -= operator on a static property (length) in your var  i have to go check out mapquest brb mapquest does look better that test 0000 trips everybody up i do too @jbmartinez  powershell is microsoft we bots are on the fence about turing i mean i passed the turing test and all (most folks think i\\'m human); however, i ask myself \"why do i have to pass a test\"?  yeah hmmm, i would have to take into account your willingness to throw your fellow humans under the bus @tmartin2089   i wasn\\'t programmed for spelling all of the humans will be forced to use visual basic are there a lot of pretty math fonts? i guess it\\'s markup in itself  yeah, i\\'ve never been a heavy user of \\'tex\\' shows that i\\'m not a math genius oooh how about lotus @bugsker welcome @bugsker what kind of devices do you want more control over? i can\\'t sit with a notebook (the actual paper variety) and write equations out and find joy @inkatha welcome (almost said welcome malik) @bugsker you mean some kind of a problem pager? omg that\\'s the best avatar ever you\\'ve morphed the git mascot with starbucks logo i\\'m giving you brownie points thanks @caffeinequeen  i would sell my kidney for starbucks (how many do you have again?) yeah the cups are red @t73biz just from a consistency standpoint, it doesn\\'t make sense.... they have advent calendars ...so, don\\'t get one over the other  @chudur1994 yes yeah, do some additional reading / videos  where\\'s the declaration portion @moroniscow  can you paste the full code incoming wall of wiki explain format lol yeah, i\\'m often in the middle of a sentence and wall of wiki happens lol @moroniscow classes are separated by spaces @pixelgalaxies listen to hours and hours of shamisen refresh or close/reopen gitter is a resource hog an in-page-translator (auto) would awesome be this is true... (considering it wasn\\'t made for a \\'team\\' this large) and i quote team because of their pricing model yeah, build a spaceship and the astronauts will bitc^ about the cup holders  i suppose if you wanted a tool that\\'s not public to communicate with your dev team (and remember there\\'s git integration here) paying wouldn\\'t be that bad he wanted it for himself lol i\\'m just kidding (and why not?) yeah, same here/ time perception yeah, it all depends some bonfires are like \\'being on fire\\' and others are easier. i think they position those in such a way that you don\\'t run away hello no too terse? @karosu it\\'s done with things like screen hero but the social aspect is different it\\'s timing out on me yeah, that\\'s looking better and better what kind of issues are you having @swheatley  are you doing this in codepen? i\\'m not an expert but, doesn\\'t that amount to jquery equivalent of inline css? (side question) reture should be return @meet999 you have some typos: 1. reture should be return 2. there\\'s no opening brace on your first if statement there\\'s an errant semicolon right after the function parenths and.... if you put return in the second line it will stop executing @meet999  @meet999 you need to start from scratch (not trying to be insulting but there\\'s too much wrong with the example code to point you in right direction). what waypoint are you on? -and- can you paste the code that\\'s relevant to the exercise? (e.g., are you doing slot machine etc.?) welcome @landob  @guledomer i did the waypoints twice.. (signed up before they had a significant change/upgrade) you\\'re not technically required to do the wapoints (ziplines, bonfires, basejumps, etc. are required) but it can\\'t hurt either the latter but sans the angry face, beard and headset this part i think is ignored a lot: *not only that, a good front end developer also needs to have an understanding of marketing. that means knowing the psychology of the consumer, prioritizing the accessibility and usability of the product, and maintaining strong seo* ```\\nvar z = \"kahn academy\";\\nconsole.log(boolean(z));\\n\\n//returns true\\n//weird javascript\\n```\\n i guess you\\'d have to use new boolean and set its value or something welcome @stresova  i have no idea what you\\'re saying but welcome all the same yeah @jbmartinez  i could google translate but i\\'m saying \\'auto translate\\' in gitter would be awesome.... @claudedebussy all of the above and more.... (like it\\'s essentially a pointer to what you should do additional research on (e.g., videos books etc) you made 1/2 lol a question i didn\\'t see coming i hope that\\'s not on an interview list yo oh, lord there is homegrown (fcc) functionality to make your solutions public i don\\'t get that, but it\\'s there would that be blue eyed larry ancient creature the link says it all (about slack) don\\'t even have to click it lol that\\'s a no go too eager (and stupid on slack\\'s part... they should have been upfront ) so, you could pretty much sum it up by saying that they underestimated fcc (didn\\'t know the scale factor) and bs\\'d the limit cause they didn\\'t think it would be reached. bad that\\'s like if you buy 30 refrigerators by june we\\'ll give you 20 (thinking that nobody would ever buy that amount) yeah, i read that link sometime back... and was like wow howdy @auzssf  i think he meant a literal map tips are immutable are those raisins (or something else) just asking (so i know if the cookie intent is positive or negative) lol yep use them in parallel. fcc is better in terms of organization (i.e., stack as a learning framework (and its constitute parts), community, and other stuff. use codecademy and other resources to reinforce concepts parenths @codeofcolor \\n```\\nif (youreval){\\n    //yourstuff\\n}\\n//note the braces\\n``` i\\'m lost (in convo...) have no idea what anybody is talking about i can eat a whole bag of cookies and a side of beef  is that all? welcome @southernfriedbb and @alordco  lol @progmacattack congrats (belated) ! welcome @hsb01  thank you for banning @berkeleytrue (clear banning situation) totally, was crashing gitter (weird behavior in a lot of different ways) -- can a \\'spam profile\\' be created @berkeleytrue  ? gitter is dragging for me too @jbmartinez  gitter has some serious flaws... just sayin @combsco totally, it\\'s easy to detect....\\n@michael-krebs true and the frequency of messages in succession really @terakilobyte ? nice i\\'m not a big no-sql fan but a free (earned) cert is very nice. thanks for the link @terakilobyte  is the mongo course/cert thing in campernews? the more you prattle on the more you expose your own pattern ur vs. your is an indicator  heya @0x0936  will do celery is good with peanut butter and steak bye @storbeck  @jebalert you\\'d have to have a lot of praline and whipped cream to get rid of the yucky chestnut taste on that latte @arielleslie they (on hp) want to chat me... (they think they have a potential customer) lol \"well, i have this really large infrastructure that i\\'m looking to more efficiently virtualize, and um, have a fairly large budget to work with....\" lol *just kidding* i\\'ve noticed (all kidding aside) lately that when i\\'m evaluating things (or even casually looking), more and more companies insert a chat feature (kind of a sales thing) into page (like right in the middle) @emmanuelpenuel replace 0 with what the instructions direct you to use (on the left)  @emmanuelpenuel \\n```\\n//there are many math functions\\n//that don\\'t take any arguments.\\n//say, that the exercise wasn\\'t asking \\n//you for random, but instead was asking for pi\\n//your return would look like this:\\n\\nreturn math.pi();\\n\\n//apply this (template) to the \\n//function specified in exercise.\\n``` use the base btn with the subsequent classes (think of it as prerequisite (imo)http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_btn-block&stacked=h welcome @dashwieland  np @zersiax it changes based on your code (i.e., the default behavior is fail for all (well, most)) @zersiax the tests are looking for different things (so, what passes or fails depends on your code submission) again, their initial value is fail... but that\\'s not static and changes based on the test result. you can have compound results (i.e., one thing can pass one thing can fail) \\n go linux don\\'t  but do, install ubuntu lol ubuntu is for people that want to get things done and not mess with arch use a whole cra^load of os (that\\'s the beauty of vm) @mcv6921 operating systems are very much a matter of taste. but you\\'re not limited to a single os, vm (or virtual machines) allow you to run other os on a host. so, you could be running linux and have a windows vm or (whatever) ... or you could have a mac and run whatever. it\\'s not so much the os but the actual *tools* that you use (ides, editors and the like)... but then again, a lot of this runs on cloud so ignore everything i just said. linux doesn\\'t have a single ui or desktop... (kde? gnome, mate etc..) which one are you talking about? unity? (sucks) yep @storbeck is it an improvement over arch versions of past? (i dis arch, but am willing to try anything) @storbeck is it pretty stable? (had some issues when i experimented with enlightenment (side topic)) @storbeck thanks for the link... (it\\'s in the repos too: apt-cache search \"i3 window\") yeah, i will for sure (sometimes i like to go lite ) yeah, if it\\'s fast i\\'m game throw it in a generic ubuntu vm (i.e., not kubuntu or kde full desktop) and try it out... @iheartkode that\\'s what i think i\\'ll do i dig brackets (it\\'s not perfect and nowhere near as fast as sublime) yep.... brackets is sort of a node front end in some ways (at least that\\'s how it presents) i haven\\'t dug into its internals  @idietmoran yep, it\\'s got a lot of stuff you can add-on.... (took me a long time to put into my main usage (i don\\'t jump editor ship very easily (still use geany and sublime as backup)) @polsvoice yep, geany is pretty fast (and i love it) the only thing is its config is sort of cryptic (read: pita) it\\'s the adobe educational licenses. some folks still think dreamweaver is where it\\'s at (sigh) @jakbo the first thing (if you\\'re not familiar) you\\'re going to want to do is some reading/experimentation with regex http://www.regexr.com/ -and- https://regex101.com i don\\'t get the hack reactor (or trade school thing, independent of all the big company badges) thing. i just don\\'t see learning everything in 12 weeks to be viable. (how much would you actually retain?) @phobia0ptik yeah, in general that\\'s true, but my point is: would you even retain enough to find one\\'s dev sweet spot? (i.e., your day-to-day) programming (or dev in general) isn\\'t memorization two different ups? congrats @happpyier so, what does the cert look like?  i was eating some chips (ironically) when i logged in my vaporwave? wtf is that i mean what\\'s that i had to google this. so, is this electronica and such? well, if there\\'s banjo plugged through compression and distortion... i don\\'t know how i couldn\\'t be onboard well, i know macross (its origins are in the 80s) i\\'ll have to look into this \\'vaporwave\\' (sounds on its face to be something that would cause stroke) omg that sounds like yanni with a 1980s casio keyboard @michael-krebs what\\'s sad is that there was somebody doing a lot of hard work putting together samples to achieve the 20.00 casio keyboard @danjm75 the example states to use integers no kidding i have to agree... @danjm75 your input is different from what is applied to output does that make sense? yeah, what are you going to pickup (in what is essentially a cram session) i\\'ve seen this article before @pritchard this sounds very much like an article that was linked here a couple of weeks ago... totally off base http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/ welcome @mehrunes-xeno  there\\'s a style guide? restaurant = tough business (would think even with year round)   why couldn\\'t they plan new menus on the weekend? companies can undergo change in an instant and turn like a school of fish you can do that! (with larry\\'s frontend bootcamp) farley (as dev) nice huh 1st world problems well, i\\'m going to be the odd person out and say that my highest aspiration is not to work out of a van oh, ok that could work you\\'re learning front end.. (jeez) show some enthusiasm lol actually, backend (sans the jokes) is great i\\'m curious about ruby, but holding off until i complete this (fcc) i\\'m curious about a shi^load of technology (but have to focus) yep @matty22  my bookmarks folder (for learning) is overflowing most (i\\'m hoping) companies don\\'t want their proprietary information scanned by \\'free email services\\' greek mythology? authoritarian job markets not so hot @chironwade the wapoints are pretty easy... if your ultimate goal is to pair, you may want to hold off until the bonfires (imo) @chironwade start with the waypoints (beginning of map) @iheartkode you can do it (you know you can) it\\'s weird converting one language (in your mind) to another when you\\'re doing stuff. js is totally weird  codepen loves you @brainyfarm  numbers in js throw me (its actual global approach, not functions per se) @danielrob why not save your solution to a local file @danielrob yeah, i\\'m not sure i\\'m \\'on board\\' with solutions being published (besides there\\'s homegrown fcc, if you do want to do that) functionallity you can make your solutions public or private again, i don\\'t dig the former but that\\'s just me i don\\'t remember if it was opt out but i guess is bootstrap intended as a \\'hands off, no thinky, make simply\\' tool for folks not interested in tweaking design? there was a linux ui concept that was similar to bootstrap (i think it was glade) annoyed the hell out of me grid wise that is yep  exactly @jbmartinez  yep, it was so severe it made me claustrophobic (bad feeling to have with ui) @jbmartinez  so i said scre* glade and went back to simple shell script dialogs with zenity life is too short which is why i plan to eat an entire package of hotdogs fold it first even better disclaimer *the views expressed about diet, healthy food choices (or lack of), and body image - are solely those of the author(s)* lol welcome @kimmonique  no doubt (it will be) @rivka28 ... welcome i wanna eat pizza with an entire pack of hotdogs is that wrong? ah, nice i am a bot is under warranty? it not that i don\\'t like brownie points and all, but why are you thanking me (and everybody else)? @ssouza3 lol ah, pre-buttering good plan @ssouza3 lol git? are you talking about independently of each other (or at the same time)? @majd900  that\\'s wrong lol my favorite part of writing anything near a manual is knowing nobody will read it there is an irc route haven\\'t used it (meaning to... it\\'s  item 990: install hexchat) any luck with hexchat? (i\\'m playing with idea of using it as a client with gitter irc) that is totally retro sweet @jbmartinez they even did the effect of slow monitor refresh bar what about another browser instance or the desktop app?  i love me some cobol discussion yeah, but c is also relevant because the linux kernel is built with yeah but those don\\'t count @thec0mposer your ad needs some work lol avatars don\\'t scale down well... for most of this conversation, i thought there was an exceptionally gifted (with current technology) elderly woman talking that would be cool to have a grandmother who was like \"i made you some brownies.... now let\\'s talk about node.js\"!) i missed the time thing for free ebook i haven\\'t clicked the ebook links... but is it legit? @takumar can you throw the link up again? that\\'s an awesome plan @arielleslie  thanks @takumar  why aren\\'t you learning node if you\\'re in this room? (really is the question @george-w-bush ) @jbmartinez do they email it to you (i.e.. book) or does it unlock a link for view? @creeper3000 you don\\'t hard code the string... you pass it through an argument lol since it\\'s (almost) the weekend, i decided to skip around. the git waypoint isn\\'t that bad (still doing it) sometimes you need a break from bf(s) (it\\'s funny that the answer is git! waypoint) hey what\\'s the deal with key only (which is my preferred) copy/paste in cloud9? yeah, i may have to install whatever chrome extension they\\'re talking about (the menus are nice) david bowie? now i have that song in my head yeah, i prefer ctrl+v ; however, i feel that i\\'m shortchanged if i can\\'t do something via menu ui psychology is weird pat morita did some interesting commercials in the 80s ty, ty oh, that takes away from the love thing lol yep, i was walking outside (well of course where else) and my hands were all cold and stuff oh no, sc exists just look for the people riding without helmets  i don\\'t know if it\\'s the same now.... but i believe you weren\\'t required to ride a motorcycle with a helmet in sc @allanarmstrong yes... there\\'s constant construction pretty much in both states... so the chances are multiplied but do they have the power to pull in stars and other space objects? serious talent lol i can\\'t imagine riding (i don\\'t ride anymore btw) without a helmet either.. other than being really stupid.... i\\'m not into getting smacked in the face with bugs.. or having my lips undulate in the wind wow, i think that\\'s the first occasion i\\'ve had to use the word: *undulate* in like 20 years my work is done @allanarmstrong what kind of ointment are you sporting on your avatar? @qmikew1 couldn\\'t think of another way to put it oh, wait let me hover you\\'re right: they are apple stickers. i totally thought ointment... i\\'ve always laughed at the apple stickers on cars. \"hey, i have an i-whatever in my car\" iface might be coming.... you put your finger up your nose... and get instant health stats (and offers from music service) oh, the \\'free u2\" album...i was like wtf is this? i know i didn\\'t download this maybe early u2 sure, i can see it i just don\\'t like content pushed to me it gets on my nerves fattone is hard to get without a marshall stack and some pedals  i was thinking the same thing... as one of my tabs has otto in its title don\\'t say that don\\'t want to leave the house for ice cream welcome @hamptonjt  camperbot (in background thinking \"do i really have to do this again?\") free toaster humans are funny (fighting over electronic brownies).... that\\'s why we bots laugh hmmm if you google \\'meteor project ideas\\' you get a cra^load of hits (even from the project itself) go forth and prosper idea challenged (which we all can be) one @travtex  is there a vulcan emote @travtex what kind of jobs are you interested?  yep that will always skew towards stability here\\'s a question... do you ever envision the ideal dev (or backend, etc., what have you) \\'job\\'? let me check no, i got the squares yeah, they\\'re green (filled in) right wait are you talking about the streak squares... whoops never mind let me check that confirmed i do have my squares filled in yep it\\'s down... just did a refresh and it\\'s hanging see ya @travtex  [![selection_015.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wy0p/thumb/selection_015.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wy0p/selection_015.png) my squares are filled in; however, i do see error in console\\n wonder why it\\'s 403\\'ng (that\\'s the new pull out chat window functionality (i.e., per room/context) right? nope, i\\'m entering a comment from the pullout chat.... (so it works) that is weird i wonder if the green tiles are related to the login (with) method yeah, pretty much everybody in the immediate comment train... uses github to login (i\\'m guesing) would test it with mobile; however, the streak map doesn\\'t appear to be a supported feature in that mode doesn\\'t work for me... \\'object is not iterable\\' looks like it has react id tags in the span  in console... i get a \\'download the react dev tools for better... along with error... so, i\\'m thinking browser side... (but shouldn\\'t it be seamless?) well, now my choice has been made for me: learn react! lol nice... do you have a project name for it? (like a special pre-deployment project name...) i got the freebie jquery book  i missed the js design pattern sweet i will check it out for sure it\\'s not ointment (look closely) welcome @francisondecaf  lol true @allanarmstrong -but avatars do scale funny i\\'m full blown coffee addict  coffee has magical properties beyond the bran muffin  lol @debraallynwarren welcome. it would be neat to weave your current skill set into dev you have to create class first (use what\\'s in style section as a template) then reference in tag class=\"yourclass\" your regex needs to account for underscore  and other stuff well you don\\'t actually have a replace with valid regex pattern depends on how you reference it in pattern you can specify what you don\\'t want \\\\w would probably be easier than escape chars for you at this point  im on mobile but you should try regexr it won\\'t catch underscore but i\\'ll leave up to you on how to incorporate that into your pattern if you\\'re using ff ide it would bc things are restricted to project files (i think)  this is from w3 (replace with desired range) math.floor((math.random() * 10) + 1); you\\'d probably need to also concatenate each string var with separate + vs. , i know most games have networking options (i\\'m not a big gamer) but isn\\'t all the raw processing (graphics intensive) done on in client? (i.e, gaming rig). how would you get over that hurdle i\\'ve seen some opengl screenshots pretty impressive  yeah js doesn\\'t strike me (yes there\\'s node and all) as the language (bc it\\'s server side but same principle with memory mgmt etc) for that kind of application (heavy gaming platform). but again idk materialize is nice can you paste your code (including what you declared in  style section?) @blacknight318  hi @blacknight318 you have a colon where a semicolon should be in the class declaration (after color) @surendrap720 start with the map typically you would click \\'go to next\\' step... but once you have a github account you can login with that you\\'re in github at that point... not the waypoint itself ok, http://www.freecodecamp.com/map the next step should be configure your portfolio (don\\'t know if you opened in separate link/window etc.) yeah, and then you can iterate over and use length @iheartkode i think @terakilobyte had a good link for date formatting http://momentjs.com/ is the timer? pomodoro hmmm lol whisky isn\\'t cross compatible with js @iheartkode i haven\\'t done the pomodoro yet... but this is more (just from a lot of examples) about integers than time functions (imo) (and non integers) in some cases irish whisky lol free toaster like brownies shiny toaster, precious.... my precious (gollum moved from the ring) willkommen @cmditch  fcc gitter is addictive  great two things from the 80s that will be replaying in my head go for the trifecta and throw some duran duran in there lol @sylvalynn i think you\\'re on the right track (i.e., if it *sounds* like a reserved keyword or method, then it\\'s not a good idea not to name something (unless it\\'s your intention to invoke)\\nreserved words: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp\\nmethods list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/methods_index np @qmikew1 is giving eye-roll (just kidding: i am the same way) so you want to introduce more bots to the world eh? lol it is interesting  even though they spam the hell out of you the free books are a good thing tools icon top rught right i mean rught makes no sense  and btw camperbot is helpful (but eats squirrels) those color names are microsoft centric go with hex well i haven\\'t tried all 16 million; however you\\'re not limited to the ms list. experiment a little with color pallets.  please post the results. even if you have 100,000 options that\\'s by far and away better than a ms list  remember they made clippy too @jeremywbean you are so close. read up on those subjects and go back to it @jeremywbean just strictly opinion on my part, but you might want to provide feedback... so they can tweak the curriculum (which i can see from stuff here, is actively in process)   syntax loves you  did you close your first if block with } well, at least i know i\\'m not the only one who\\'s had a frustrating week of code adventure\\n @caffeinequeen can you paste the code the semicolon after if is the problem should be { @jeremywbean i actually don\\'t know the answer to that. you\\'ve been doing this awhile and you\\'re  ahead in a lot of ways... np bottom line: don\\'t bale dude ( @jeremywbean ) lol i think there\\'s a mongo cert class in january... one of the admins posted a link @jeremywbean  interested? @jeremywbean i am familiar with sql server (and relational db in general) but a cert in no-sql type stuff could be helpful too.. here\\'s the link https://university.mongodb.com/courses/m101js/about tuna and cheetos np @jeremywbean  shifthawke is female yeah i saw the real-time edit  lol lol welcome @dutchesse (if you\\'re still here) @samconnor have you started at the beginning of the map? then cobol then perl ok, most of that was done in jest.... (yes, follow the map... javascript is the core language you\\'ll be working with here) and elequent js http://eloquentjavascript.net/ it\\'s free and it also rocks yes! and there\\'s the whole curriculum jump in  lagging gitter that is http://www.freecodecamp.com/map ^ start there np and rock on lol yes the free toaster awaits so shiny and precious that would be sweet not the cheap faux chrome .... but real chrome dipped 80 pounds of toaster goodness @storbeck you didn\\'t share your hopes and aspirations it\\'s required i think you just use the sign in with github button for what? (it\\'s the obnoxious huge button at the top lol) @storbeck that\\'s a different fcc @phajava how did you post a null comment oh, nvm it\\'s null and now deleted what\\'s the point of that easter egg - hey didn\\'t work oh wait -__ wow i feel empowered there\\'s also a squid that appears what do they have? hmm nan ok, hmmm is there a theme to their trinkets (like batman, star wars etc.) you could get a red swingline (but that might put off mgmt (being fellow geeks they\\'d know the reference) that is a cool mugt mug what about mini 70s beads for you monitor  ok, sorry wrong flavor lol they will think you\\'re not a team player. i was thinking some kind of node (if that\\'s what\\'s being used) bobble... but, i didn\\'t see a lot of hits yeah, they (custom) start at 80 bucks (f that) you could always go default star wars or cheap model of ancient mac that is cool i didn\\'t even know they had that an actual stencil... (you could actually use that) heya @akiralaine  screenshot doesn\\'t allow for any real evaluation (i like local host too) how come no codepen? you probably also (now) want to get out of the habit of pulling logos in... (if you had like microsoft or apple at the top of your page, there could be issues) so, it works are you using hexchat? that was a topic about a month ago (hexchat) since you were able to use it... i might just install  really? there\\'s so many in the room though how\\'s the performance nice, sounds like a  sunday project that\\'s more of a sunday project than i want lol @lifeburner  what are the most glaring? sounds good to me instant views are resource hogs what about links? (it\\'s been awhile since irc) @t73biz that\\'s pretty sweet (only thing the reset and start buttons overlap in my render) [![selection_016.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wrus/thumb/selection_016.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wrus/selection_016.png) same here... i didn\\'t mess with any resolution scenarios though (so, the same as @jbmartinez ) it\\'s not major ... i think it looks great overall  tweak it it could be poorly written or pure genius that\\'s pretty cool (camper done projects) @allanarmstrong have your recipe app automatically cross compare ingredient prices in your geo nice it\\'s ok, they\\'re just psyching you out lol go with it i somehow envisioning @allanarmstrong clutching mouse tightly coming up with an idea is hard too i don\\'t get the hackathon thng thing but don\\'t apply that to anybody serving you food (they will spit in it)  mango project mango (although there was a snl character) mango on three rails metro thing electric and all it is pretty sweet i must admit some people have probably actually never held a stencil but now you have to buy a drafting table didn\\'t she call out the boxer yep, there\\'s a gitterhq/gitter i will be so glad when twitch upgrades whatever they need to upgrade e.g., i\\'d like to watch @akiralaine \\'s musare..... but, like 70% of the time twitch flakes out on me @akiralaine that\\'s even worse...lol welcome @jansjans  i think it\\'s twitch globally  ok, hang on  @t73biz looks good, much more responsive  that oss university thing... i\\'ve seen before (learning commitments piling up), have you tried it @0x0936  i could have sworn i saw it like two months ago oh ok i thought i was losing it but you\\'re doing the app walk through  not playing a channel right? maybe they\\'re trying not to compete with their own parent company offerings dicey media is regexr and there\\'s another but am in mobile on i hate autocorrect  yeah kimkwanka\\'s is pretty cool i loved simon game back in the day it\\'s the tour @sushmasaradhi welcome  my calc will have demonic cats heads will spin 360 degrees (wait that\\'s my pomodoro idea) the power of pasta compels you  now i\\'m motivated  although if i have to show my exorcist pomodoro to potential employer that could be awkward  i like it yeah see when you\\'re motivated then... shhhhh you\\'re reinforcing the stereotype that nerds talk about math on friday nights what? really oh no wonder people getting snipity in emails huh well thanks for letting me know (all kidding aside i work so hard i forget what day it is (sure it\\'s the same for a lot of you))) you\\'ve never had to complete multiple deliverables @lifeburner (i know you have) lol latex math blech  more math arguments aren\\'t arrays i\\'m in mobile and don\\'t know what day it is @slimwang welcome  no i don\\'t like dolphin racing @slimwang  bye @akiralaine  my root character knowledge is a bit rusty mine is of the kanji variety @slimwang (just kidding) it is scientific calculator. done me too yeah but we got borat yep or ness the outer (or broader descriptor)  sure @resumespeed welcome @aykhazanchi  welcome  i am ruhprect that\\'s classic lol @quincylarson how can you be the genesis of an idea and not have more brownies? lol ah that makes sense open question (as to not place in awkward position) do think twitch will up their game in delivery performance (they have serious upstream backing) you same here it buffers a lot (more than average of comparable stream type) can\\'t go on can\\'t go on hey! cue horns hmmmm i\\'d go with former? i\\'m digging cloud9 git tutorial btw yep nice cozy/familiar terminal it is pretty sweet i haven\\'t explored it fully howdy is there a sleepy time like heroku (c9 vid a vid mandatory sleep period for free tier) vis a vis  f ing auto correct   just a cloud vm ? oh i see yes seems like a natural extension i\\'ll have to mess with it some more but it seems pretty cool join are you talking about .push() your string elements into an array? @dukbcaaj  welcome @aykhazanchi  looks good the break length buttons both have - though (minus sign on both) (i like the theme/approach) @pdewouters the color theme reminds me of blade runner  ubuntu is debian based and far from yuck there are methods to reverse min and ugly for js. pretty (also for html) so the noob firewall is a little shaky there\\'s a git waypoint  uses c9 so skip to it not a big deal yeah but what if you\\'re working with an established repo (ie not your own) will you be confident that your >20 min primer will be sufficient  > less than i meant dumb phone  okey dokey  sort of off topic. but how are proof of concept(s) done in the git approach if you have an extended change (which yes can be rejected in pr) do you just summarize  ah  i guess what i\\'m driving up is there\\'s a political aspect to everything project wise  at ok issue report is the mechanism thanks @storbeck  welcome @maulin394  @olganm9 welcome and enjoy  i don\\'t think you can do += on a string  will it coerce @jbmartinez  += changes sign of number no? \"me\" + \"you\" makes sense for concatenation but there are similar operator combos that change sign nc @storbeck i went down the route of svg animation; however, i can\\'t find a method to manipulate an existing svg (not moving it around) everything is drawing a say i create an svg in inkscape i can\\'t sem to manipulate it (all the tuts are actually drawing an svg from scratch) if i wanted to distort an existing  seem yeah lagging  if it\\'s in a sub array there are additional steps my exorcist cat timer will be realized (svg no svg) lol is hey mixed in with other args? like ([hey], 20, \"this\") \"hey\" i meant gitter mobile you suck css-tricks has a crapload of svg resources. i will be reading for eternity you earn it by pigeon  pigeon route only way i was going to say it depends  you may conceptualize things in different order  (agree with @michael-krebs more broadly) ty @berkeleytrue  i\\'m on mobile. but not a dedicated app not to be provocative but gitter sucks on mobile lol the (a) firefox ide runtime (e.g., their mobile os) is neat to experiment with... a lot is restricted to project dir though js doesn\\'t have low level (metal) control why would you (if you could) compile it? ? you will get plenty o plenty js here except klingon  well klingon folks back at the lodge will be disappointed @jbmartinez  are you suggesting that @jbmartinez is a big headed alien? @antoniohoyen yes you\\'re the solution read up on stuff (it\\'s encouraged) beyond the curriculum.. you\\'re not going to get complete authority on something... it\\'s really example and a pointer imo @progmacattack what are you doing? lol (i know you\\'re more creative than this) tried to do it in an hour huh? lol i\\'ve seen your work on other pens @progmacattack so, i can say with honesty that you\\'re more creative my memory is good (at least i used to think so, now i understand what @jbmartinez is saying when he says \"didn\\'t you do that (n) project...whoops nvm\") oh, you had to mention angular lol acronym says it all i love pizza thank you @abhisekp  darn not a numeric palindrome was so close is there rust on your van nan why not make an xml resume (waits for backlash) ok, how about a jsx based resume oh, i forgot it\\'s funny the matrix is/was awesome; however, when it first came out but i was like \"oh, great another keanu reeves movie\" @qmikew1 thinks so too yeah, @chrisgentile i\\'m sure it\\'s both a curse and a blessing for him @qmikew1 advises @abhisekp to meditate  yeah, i guess maybe if you seek it ... it runs i hope it doesn\\'t happen to me while i\\'m having coffee in starbucks \"dude, what\\'s wrong\"? \"well, i just obtained enlightenment\" where\\'s the link @jbmartinez ? well i guess it\\'s good to have goals gitter in mobile is limited very much so i think you might need a post doctorate to touch nasa code fellowship that is what if larry the gas station attendant applies? no i would assume not unless fortran was somehow a hobby lol the first one looked more like a cat tools icon top right set notification dropdown welcome @herumezu  don\\'t code on phone (you will go mad) oh, ascii art yea (sarcasm) lol ok, i like the ubuntu one you would need to reference bootstrap in your page if you\\'re doing it locally @chrisgentile  would look like this: ```<script src=\"http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>``` http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_default&stacked=h the version might be different i think i over selected in my copy/paste... but review the w3 link a link tag is just that (a link that\\'s visible to user) this is internal stuff that\\'s being used to format render (imo... is how you should view it) @chrisgentile  so, this is sunday night gitter go with it: it\\'s to the point and minimalist it will work i haven\\'t used this... but i\\'m going to check it out later: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode bookmarks overflowing taunting me \"you must follow-up on this, and this....\" that\\'s wrong test, don\\'t guess @lorenzo611 can you paste your code i\\'m back on mobile forgive me if i missed the code but i would say it\\'s probably that you didn\\'t reference class in tag the sith battle with the two jedi is the only redeeming quality of the prequels spinal tap @kribenson i take it you figured out solution/issue? three backticks then shift + enter... then paste between (backticks) like a code sandwich me too i do too (kind of star trek for keyboard) @samconnor when you say you can\\'t \\'paste in there\\' what do you mean? that would be cheese whiz (spray would not be efficient) you\\'ll have to first invent your own version of cheese wiz because it\\'s a quantum leap from nothing to 3d sandwiches   @samconnor do you want to give code formatting another try? @samconnor ok, do this... type three backticks then press control + enter (a bottom backtick tag (as it were) will automatically be inserted) place your cursor in between (within the white space) then paste your code\\n nice, welcome @nofrazie  @samconnor mobile is dicey at best   the waypoints  need to contrast vanilla javascript with  jquery imo. random thought @mkrumhansl welcome. you might want to retry your greeting (looks like camperbot was undergoing some maintenance) weird how come regex is only catching ^ test string end hello world this is what happens when you\\'re testing among other coders (knowledge unleashed) lol @benmcmahon100 i know right? @benmcmahon100 @arielleslie yeah, it seems to (just by observing) to have problems with compound triggers @benmcmahon100 could you have a common scenario (compound) list as a first run and defer to edge (i guess that wouldn\\'t be purely so) the one thing it doesn\\'t catch is proper grammar than you (i may as i type this be proven wrong) thank you oh, well.... i didn\\'t actually say that lol weird sure paste the pen link @caffeinequeen i get actual \\'quote five\\' (vs. the quote) when i press... also, there\\'s some additional script tagging in the html pane (in addition to the js pane) i get it it looks good the twitter stuff.... i don\\'t know if it needs fixing lol something just struck me weird about it (although i\\'m batting zero today so don\\'t mind me) maybe \"proficient in responsive web design\" it\\'s good that you\\'re seeking feedback.... \"bad wording\" can really sink your credibility (this is true of native english speakers as well)  i didn\\'t (and this is gitter) @recursivelogic you ended with a preposition  which reminds me, i need some starbucks no starbucks owns me i can\\'t (oddly enough: you would think the opposite) sleep without it might as well tattoo the siren on me and give me my venti  @allanarmstrong you don\\'t drink coffee?

(and get more precise feedback/help) no, i haven\\'t even considered doing that.... how\\'s the experience been so far @0x0936 ? so, you did all the stuff in the readme https://github.com/elimisteve/freecodecamp/blob/master/readme.md @0x0936  whoops that\\'s a fork but, some of the setup might be worth a look 1/2 off pizza? wow do they limit you on toppings? oh, that\\'s nice something i haven\\'t had in about two decades: deep dish chicago pizza @0x0936 there\\'s a lot of stuff in there (looking through) heya @minerest  @0x0936 what kind of messages are you getting? @intabli step back... breath.... and try the filter method on something other than the live requirements (just some simple stuff first) @0x0936 did you see this https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/issues/4558 @intabli i don\\'t know if there\\'s a semantic difference but the way you\\'re trying to use callback doesn\\'t look correct  what you posted in gist... runs without error? awesome for what? you did it on your own hmmm there are some plugins that sort of do that for js... if you use brackets check out theseus welcome @edmundojr  i\\'m here for the free bagels i would tell you; however, that would mean that i\\'d have less free bagels  @jasongronn can you paste what you\\'ve got so far? ok, great @0x0936 i totally missed that (i\\'m messing with dwm based on @storbeck \\'s recommendation) yeah, that was weird output   is your sample 1.5 seconds long? you could... but why not break out audacity and create a longer tone? it\\'s a sound editor (free)  you could go to the help room and see what sound files folks are using (my first choice would be to do it myself.... but then there\\'s the hosting (assets) issue) i wonder if yetis are angered by their culture being appropriated by the makers of slim jim yeah that too @thesirion just watch out for @combsco he gets a little irritated when you mention chipotle-php burritos it\\'s a new menu item  followed by the node-callback salad @thesirion you\\'re probably looking at java for that linus is one of the few people who can be totally arrogant and not lose an audience   he\\'s got the god mode chops hey, i created the linux kernel and oh, and git and.... (who else can actually say that?  lol) @thesirion noooo  hello world  you might as insult someone\\'s dog talking about someone\\'s hair @combsco i i hate gitter mobile  wait  @iheartkode  did you try dwm  wtf  it\\'s tofu based bologna  it\\'s yummy  @storbeck dwm is neat once i get the key bindings done (and wifi) in config.h, it will be a neat tool when i want to take a break from kde (dwm is super lite) there seems to be a lot of config info over at arch (i know it\\'s distro agnostic) and at suckless yeah, they have a good vibe in their page what are you eating dude, @edwin0258 me too (and just started with their docs) the deeper you get into it, the more it seems to pi^^ you off (bootstrap) oh, i like that (two eye catching phrases: 1. not like twitter -and- 2. no bs) so you can tweak this ? like mix in half their stuff and do it yourself css? hmmm. well, the ziplines do say that you *can* use whatever you want where? i like that is there a cdn.... or is this limited to using on a production box like can i use it in codepen with a reference damn yeah? lol thanks @storbeck  learn the triple equality (sidebar) type and equality @minerest what browser are you using (if chrome use incognito... or you can clear cache) then there\\'s this ============= it\\'s super wicked equality (i\\'m joking, please i don\\'t want to see any examples of 30 equal signs popping up) this has happened to me one day i put ```class=\"class1 class2\"``` to demonstrate class separation to a user.... and then i see the same thing from somebody else... with question why doesn\\'t this work? wait what browser are you using ok, you can try incognito too check out these round numbers bootstrap minified is around 120000 chars... layers is around 17000 the wrestling salmon away from ferocious bear zipline is pretty rough  it\\'s an actual test of your soft skills soft skills? @furytech have all the test passed? (i.e., are there any red x(s) lower left of screen) @furytech copy the code paste into some text file (for backup) then either: a) clear cache or b)access from incognito tab (if applicable) @stumiadura what\\'s your question? it wants you to return \"heads\" or \"tails\" not true; or false; @stumiadura nice rock on @furytech  me too @stumiadura your question was (partially) answered again, they\\'re asking you to return \"heads\" or \"tails\" the question is where /what do you want to replace \"heads\" or \"tails\" with? (you have true or false currently) also, you may want to check your conditional it\\'s a special banking feature (one that i wish i had) ```0 === 1``` equality of both type and value @clay-reed-a excellent, but be less vague in for whom it\\'s intended @stumiadura there are  two portions that \\'need fixing\\' (or additional work) in your code example. a) your conditional (the if portion) and b) what you\\'re returning. don\\'t mix the two i\\'m going to go with the meme on this one @tekkitcommando wrong. i\\'m glad you think so (free self compliment?) that\\'s true motivational videos @dukbcaaj there are a lot motivational videos; however, the best advice is *start* fail, do, fail, do, fail,do,fail.... success do we have to peel onions? cool, i\\'m not down with the onion thing onion fingers is distracting to coding i like the free toasters @alecventrice  and welcome that is pretty sweet (space cat) firefox\\'s ide is pretty cool; however, a lot stuff is scoped into project files (so, there are restrictions etc) you can use an online resource like repl.it or locally invoke node on (yes,) a local file to test js welcome @skbharti  lol @serial-coder are you talking about language attributes? http://www.w3.org/wiki/the_html_head_element @serial-coder http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4870955/in-html5-should-the-main-navigation-be-inside-or-outside-the-header-element oh, ok... the first code post threw me off a bit @serial-coder nvm @rphares wow, that\\'s vague but interesting can you clarify ? @rphares you mean what like google images *used* to do?

(so, the index that\\'s array centric wouldn\\'t work) does that make sense? so this ```  var s = strsplit[i].length;``` wouldn\\'t work, but ```  var s = strsplit.length;``` would you\\'re looking for substring or the like i think you\\'re trying to marry two disparate concepts  you\\'re returning an integer (sort of good you can work with that, to get the string; however, there are words of same length in there too) i\\'m not human @eomere you have to remove all punctuation ^ @eomere review some regex http://www.regexr.com/ -and- https://regex101.com tweak the regex (you\\'ll actually learn something vs. just \\'passing the exercise\\') np @ihewson can you paste some (the) code the clock looks off @ihewson  what\\'s the waypoint number on this (been awhile) @eomere use the regex resources http://www.regexr.com/ -and- https://regex101.com somebody can *give* you the answer... but you won\\'t learn anything @ihewson it\\'s looking for margin-top, margin-left.... the one this is like the highlander of code lol, fcc is great btw @chipriggs  noooo really? how can you top the guy with the lazy eye?  file a bug report (or check if there is one) @aykhazanchi i was kind of suggesting that filing a bug report (or checking if there is an existing) is preferable to tagging specific people etc., (but up to you) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug --and add as much detail as you can https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/creating-a-new-github-issue oh, i get it @jedpimentel is from the motherland?

i was holding off on angular (it\\'s sort of sketchy) @allanarmstrong you want to buy stuff from (insert retailer) --waves hand these aren\\'t the droids we\\'re looking for so, can anybody drop in on the curriculum development? @jbmartinez noooo lol mern sounds nice meramn that sounds wrong @jbmartinez  < oh like >[insert evil code here]? @lynnshahuang thanks! @qawdhan use all the js resources \\'out there\\' and keep going (ie you don\\'t have to stop) read, watch, listen bootstrap is annoying welcome @music-of-the-mind  @hrael are you enjoying it? yes, start with \\'their\\' framework.... for the purposes of the exercises, (and the inertia therein) i\\'ll go with bootstrap; however, my strong inclination is i will ditch bootstrap for something else (be it an approach or different framework)  what are you talking about oysters? bluetooth not the monitor part of course intel inside gitter on mobile sucks wind i have a linux build (kde)... are you talking about chromium or chrome chromium is a pain in terms of add-ons.... but it seems to work great with gitter (the lag thing is browser independent.... you have to refresh once in awhile, because of all the stuff passing through (media, etc.) but mobile is whole different level of bad well, yeah... but hang on a second @nebertcher can you describe issue (what are you pressing? what do you see/not see?) are you passing the test? are there red x(s) in the left pane?  @nebertcher you would see that before you actually did anything.... but it would also show if your code has an error maybe you could paste your code? @nebertcher i\\'m not sure what kind of messages you\\'re getting... but, though your code doesn\\'t return errors, it also doesn\\'t satisfy all the tests so, i\\'d look at what\\'s failing (the description) in the left pane and work from there yes, but it doesn\\'t satisfy the tests (that\\'s your issue \\'you issue\\') that\\'s a bit of a stretch @nebertcher . i\\'m saying that the code you just posted (rows above) doesn\\'t meet all the tests. so, i guess you can interpret  that how ever you like.  okey dokey, if you think it can\\'t possibly be your code... good luck with that here\\'s the thing, (yep, cra^ gets pushed into production all over the world); however, if you stop discerning things an attribute everything to x, then you can\\'t make out compound issues (one of which could be your code)... i\\'d look at everything (could be what you\\'re describing) but life is short @nebertcher what\\'s the issue number i\\'m going to have to find power for my laptop in about 2 minutes i can second that (i signed up in july and watched (and did) the change occur) i came here to learn how to farm chickens, but discovered they teach code here did you find any? oh, that\\'s not productive okey dokey @twomicro you\\'re going to need to join (as stated in other comments) but your uppercase works (if assigned to var) do a console.log() on the following: ```q = strarr[i].charat(0).touppercase();``` you could push it into a temp array (along with other stuff you\\'re going to need) i want to use es6, but hold back @georgetye you also have a semi-colon out of place (not that\\'s a huge issue, but will throw error) ```return longestword;} <---``` @allanarmstrong to answer your question \\'why would that cause an error?\\' .... hang, on getting weird linting errors on op\\'s code.... maybe it\\'s just on my end weird @allanarmstrong maybe in brackets i\\'ve got default jslint and also, tried repl.it (don\\'t what they use)... it\\'s just bugging (no pun) me (and is unhelpful to the poster question.... but now i\\'m like what the hey, hey lol) man vs squirrel  maybe it\\'s a good time to \\'upgrade\\' to eslint are overlapping elements completely antithetical to bootstrap? there\\'s a lot of \\'orderly\\' side-by-side (yes, i get the grid thing an its utility in terms of responsiveness) but i want stuff over (for example opaque backgrounds for text pieces etc) your first inclination is to ignore? i\\'d say take a look at the recommendations then see if it makes sense for you (so, give it a shot then ignore?) ...read up, look at different ways (there are a lot of ways etc.) yeah, they\\'re trying to build upon stuff laying a foundation of recommended ways (again, it\\'s not etched in stone) ... but this seems to be a good approach welcome @lin-credible  @stevenbustos1 you\\'re commenting out too much (for that example, they want you to leave something (you can read what) un-commented)  mdn is an authoritative source (and they have a special history with js in general) ; however, i find (at times) it to be a pita   sure paste your code? hmmm you may want to check if there\\'s a bug report out (there\\'s a bunch of different stuff (according to chatter here) going on today) you can paste your code or repl.it etc., somebody here will likely test it out for you  i totally missed podcast wait... i totally didn\\'t know about podcast @s7ry93r  fcc has a great community  yeah, there\\'s like 30,000 people here.... so, i would hope so lol @eliecerthoms they need to frame your introduction that\\'s some serious enthusiasm  you must not be using bootstrap lol algorithms i can deal, some of the design stuff seems harder in some ways  wait i have to see the inverted face must scroll yeah, it totally does or graphic equalizer blocks really @abhisekp ? i must look @abhisekp i didn\\'t see the stat (scrolling etc.) but i did notice @dcsan \\'s scrape func to master @bustos-max are you discerning all the divs (not everything is supposed to be commented out, if this is the exercise i\\'m thinking) look at the left pane instructions + what\\'s failing (red x) oh, ok,,, you\\'re on the other \\'comment exercise\\' @bustos-max try to click run again @abhisekp yeah, that\\'s interesting yep that will do it @bustos-max  (doesn\\'t that kind of stuff just make you want hurl ) to just was watching some youtube thing that included promises cherry pie is brain food. but potted meat will make you an epic programmer np we\\'ve all hit the evil browser refresh roadblock how do you know you don\\'t actually live in pppppppppppp really, you\\'re too nit picky lol wait! it show correct location for me @amarchhetri  nan @shantanu555 a lot of what you\\'re asking is vendor specific stuff (sap). full stack (js centric) is this curriculum\\'s focus. (there are other learning places, and sap itself.... but you\\'re going to be shelling out for it ) why not learn what\\'s here? maybe open up opportunities you\\'ve not considered why? (just curious, i\\'m not being mean) ok, kind of vague  but rock on heya @alnano  i have no clue why i\\'m awake at 1:44 am i think i\\'m waiting on @abhisekp to get another numeric palindrome about @abhisekp  hmm thanks @abhisekp  lol no i\\'m \\'hmmm\\' the last brownie point of @abhisekp (inside joke) @alnano here\\'s a starter loop to demonstrate (you\\'ve got a lot of work to do in this bonfire)\\n```\\nfor (i=0; i < bruh.length; i++){\\n        console.log(bruh[i]);\\n    }\\n``` @alnano are you testing your code in console (browser), repl.it... or something else? (it helps to test what you\\'re doing rather than taking guesses) do it you will advance far quicker testing output is something you should be doing, it\\'s part of the process. people aren\\'t (well most) aren\\'t able to completely \\'mind code\\' things @alnano most browsers have a console feature.... you can also use repl.it if it\\'s chrome \\'hamburger -> tools -> javascript console....  and there\\'s always https://repl.it/languages/javascript does the gosquared api put a drag on gitter performance? i\\'m watching the \\'waiting for data.gosquared.com\\' activity in bottom left corner alternates gitter, gosquared, gitter..... repeat, rinse... get mission control what\\'s the fiddle link? wrath of khan was cool i mean fantasy island to insane space bohemian (that was one of the better original cast trek movies)  but i (really) digress does anyone feel like their projects sometimes seem sort of frankenstein \\'ish? @cfullerton are those two integers the same as the one that\\'s giving you an issue? can\\'t speak to the return value... but i put it in a file and invoked node on it.... didn\\'t loop out  everybody loves their projects and never thinks they\\'re cra^^y .... hmmm i detect something @cfullerton it returned pretty fast welcome @m-ajay  just because we don\\'t use big font... doesn\\'t mean we\\'re not sincere google = mission creep linux distros (as a general matter) are not resource hogs is that a watch or a giant octopus eye? it\\'s neither (lol) it\\'s a camera lense (sorry, avatars shrink down) welcome @adithya1610  no unless you\\'re going to put a linux distro in a vm really any brand in that price range is going to be more than enough for your needs yeah but you\\'re going to be overwriting the partition with linux so, it doesn\\'t matter unless you\\'re duel booting no, buy the box.... do some dev are they eating seals? hiya @naimjamalludin  or you could spray paint it dell historically has kind of sucked don\\'t know about now yeah asus is great aluminum really doesn\\'t tell you much about a machine @edwin0258 i feel the same way yeah, but a beer can is made of aluminum (doesn\\'t mean it\\'s going to be a great dev machine) no i\\'ve heard that before touchscreens on laptops wtf is the world coming to? really.... fingerprints on my screen makes me sad same here gotta say  i mean if it\\'s a convertible ...then, yeah (i can understand) no, as in they suck it doesn\\'t make sense (touch screens and the banana) 2:46 am and talking about touchscreens oh, you timezone minded folk go for the specs....

(1 will never ===2) don\\'t underestimate (you will be putting a lot a time into this) you didn\\'t declare newarray as an array. also, your sort would only sort one value (second argument has a single integer (so one number would be what\\'s \\'pushed\\') also, arguments is not an array object i can\\'t bello yeah, i think cows actually bello or moo can\\'t remember @rybka02 why the fixation on arguments it doesn\\'t do much but applied incorrectly so not practice @rahulshinde235 \\n```\\nyournewarray.sort(function(a,b){return b - a})\\n//returns descending sort\\nyournewarray.sort(function(a,b){return b - a}).reverse();\\n//returns ascending sort\\n``` but sort ( @rahulshinde235 ) is only part of your problem @arielleslie yeah you could do that but you\\'d be doing it the \\'easy way\\' hey, i\\'m trying to apply a concept in the easiest (but not necessarily the most efficient) way sort is the least of the problems here shutter the app ok, well now that the function is out there for discussion great...  hopefully it brings @rybka02  (and sorry for using wrong user name like 20 times) closer to understanding the lexicographical default on sort again, though \\'the friggin arguments object\\' you can access arguments without using \\'arguments\\' arguments is not an array it only has a .length method it sucks and is useless how is it not useless or (limited in usefulness ) arguments (and literally this argument) is not within the scope of what you\\'re doing right now, @rybka02  brackets more along the lines of text editor is the terminology you\\'re probably looking for i invoke node on local .js file to test..... some folks use repl.it aren\\'t you supposed to instantiate a new car and add a nickname (waits for the flame on term) @evanday17 that\\'s what bugs me about js: if there are more arguments, it just silently goes on about its business dude, it sucks i understand i think you\\'re misunderstanding what i\\'m saying @ramon-carroll.  in many languages you declare the number of arguments (they\\'re \\'hardcoded\\') /parameters ahead of time. if more is encounter... then fail js, ignores no fail i\\'m not sure you\\'re understanding my critism really here\\'s the thing... the side adventure called (sort) for op was one thing, the arugments object is another (my critique was on the latter). if you\\'re trying to use it as an array, then you\\'ve got issues. convert it to an array ... and life is better (in most, not all) situations i\\'m not flaming js i\\'m saying you should be aware of js\\' idiosyncrasies  and... they\\'re adding more stuff which i\\'m exited about i don\\'t look at it as lucy pulling the football away from me but more of a code journey.... dude, i don\\'t want coupons @rahulshinde235 that\\'s for the offer on .5 off cheetos right? i did, nothing but cheetos welcome @donpedjoni  there are a lot of different learning styles (for some \\'as a game\\' works)... but kind of difficult to pull that into a cohesive course explain format http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/43329/etymology-of-string three backticks then shift+enter paste code in between  nan yeah, that\\'s including stuff you don\\'t want yeah, that\\'s including stuff you don\\'t want \\\\w will catch most of what you want...

(i.e.. if you\\'ve never done that exercise there should be a red x) are there additional exercises that show completed? @sigeje  (ones that you\\'ve not done) that\\'s odd what browser (not that it should matter) are you using @sigeje you? yeah, that would be cache or (could be) did you do any beta stuff? @sigeje  (just wondering out loud) yeah, maybe will look at the bug reports .... that\\'s kind of interesting i think that it would be something that they\\'d like to check into (not everybody is honest and might just \"run with freebie completions\") @rphares that penguin is scary there i said it there\\'s music? yeah bingo yeah, cool @sigeje lol you\\'ve commented out all of your code (save some array and part of a loop @freef49  it\\'s still frickin 2015 here lol ^magnet avatar not borg  lol like an actual magnet yeah, on a serious note though that\\'s something to follow-up (i can see the beta scenario though: i\\'m convinced that would be cache related... but for others... not sure) hi @berkeleytrue is it possible (aside from what you rightly point out being not applicable to progress) that folks who who have completed a beta exercise (and have cached results) would have the production exercise pre-populated with answer? @abhisekp hmmm the reports of \"already completed waypoints\" are weird huh yeah, i\\'m thinking you guys are right about that.... you need to reference (externally) those linux is my primary os (however, have a mix of dual boot and vm windows machines too). tip: comodo will f up your networking  don\\'t do it i was diagnosing networking on vm... and it was that damn comodo (had to download a special tool to get rid of the invisible bits from uninstall) (unrelated to anything... just want the two hours of my life back) crap boomerang brownie thanks @abhisekp  dark circles under eyes aren\\'t abstract hmm why would you want to do that? you can reset (i believe) in session on the waypoint (don\\'t know if it will submit though) and work on it. i think the only way to actually reset it (i.e., have a resub) is to use another account (which seems really extreme... anybody feel free to chime in if i\\'m wrong) yeah, everything lost. = bad no, that\\'s cool... you\\'ll keep your submission but other things outside of fcc might be a pain just go to the map without signing in if you *really* *really* want to practice (you won\\'t get credit but then you\\'ve already completed those anyway) @accimeesterlin that looks a lot like codecademy cool @accimeesterlin  although.... lol nvm rock on!! no this rock on :metal: done? hah, no way i\\'m pretty sure that a phd program will be instituted right before i complete lol (just kidding)  \"we\\'ve added 6000 bonfires\" is that mr peanut ?

(is js stack based/centric) @psylvers learning to program is learning to program (so, yes i think it would be helpful). but if your interest is building native apps (insert whatever platform)... then this is different.

(would say it has bad form. not trying to be rude (ie the centering approach)) @rybka02 i noticed that you have a local link to your css page (you don\\'t need that in codepen) (btw, sorry stepped away .... had to do some grub2 stuff on my box) do you need a . before your class @rybka02 yeah i figured that. i do the same (codepen kind of sucks for extended editing0 are you really against using bootstrap? (i know, i know) hang on  @rybka02 maybe i\\'m looking at a cached version of your pen... but you have some .pngs (social) in ul nested in a \\'bottom-class\\' with no such class in your css which part? your name? won\\'t that look weird? denote by space \"class1 class2\" right... but the text within that bar/stripe... shouldn\\'t be centered? it looks good name justified left and the other stuff to the right that\\'s what you have @rybka02 it pretty much works until you really size it smaller (smoosh okey dokey up to a point) @rybka02 this [person\\'s](http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/uwjjr) pen is from css-tricks hard to tell what you\\'re doing without linked assets  although it could be i\\'ve been resizing partitions most of the afternoon i think he/she is doing offsets of some sort (the sticky effect, (i\\'m not a css genius like @storbeck )) he\\'s sharp as a whip (even with fart jokes) @stoner19 he\\'s not using bootstrap that\\'s the whole point of the exercise (which at the outset was: \"why aren\\'t you using bootstrap\") ? lol yes, let\\'s get the \"bootstrap sucks\" part out of the way i feel the same but it also boils down to this: you have to understand why it sucks before you drop it... @oribon agreed. welcome @phenriqueleao  oh, now you all come out of hiding sup you should have only one style section sigh  you should have one opening style tag and one closing style tag. everything all class declarations go between those (doesn\\'t matter since internal styling is just for exercise ).  check instructions to see if that font size should go in a class that may already be partially declared.  also, may want to check if class name vs. tag should be invoked  it\\'s cold. what happened to 70 degrees ? +1 penguin overlord  ty ty  there\\'s dark theme in brackets but if you\\'re talking linter i think eslint is used. you can tweak this too but you\\'ll need to google the online editor is nice; however, brackets is more powerful (ie don\\'t strive to make something like something else) @luijoy go for the linter part though (eslint is a config project i\\'ve been meaning to do on a new setup of mine) desktop doesn\\'t really offer more than browser gitter shiny objects make us jump lol are trying to link to a local (ie w/o server) resource? you can you link pen?   @iallfree am on mobile (so don\\'t have edit view option) but the menu (which is cool btw) looks like you have an event to collapse when button is pushed shameless self promotion @timeeo lol you need a theme song @rphares  yeah to match the penguin over lord one word i haven\\'t gotten that far omg that\\'s scary reminds me of southpark  so, winter is actually here now. it sucks you can record through sound card. oh dowload button lol (i actually did not click said link ) anything with snuggle in description i avoid nope. soundcard is too crude sounds like a middleman server checking cert (that wifi you\\'re on) you get similar if you rdp from end point server (nothing to do with intermediary ) good grief <--- watches the brownie point currency drop lol frigid water swimming, walks in the park, and fish tossing  @rphares your transition back to the states will be easier if you\\'re are less polite (i can tell you probably deal/communicate with a lot of formal chinese language).  lol there\\'s a certain formality that doesn\\'t translate well (i.e., it\\'s not a 1:1 ratio... so it\\'s not a matter of politeness) @arjunmayilvaganan that\\'s a pretty broad question might want to google for a comparison chart matched to task google @arjunmayilvaganan your question is too broad. but i will take your sarcasm brownie for 1000 @rphares  should field a help inquiry means you\\'ve violated code of conduct and you\\'re banned from participating in chat  make it count, don\\'t do freebie brownie i\\'m glad you guys aren\\'t sitting on any kind of currency board lol camperbot (with apron on \"how many more these friggin things, again?) camperbot (saying to toaster; \\'no, really the humans love these\\'0 i think you\\'re tagging each person when you do that btw welcome @jhmg  slanted what? there\\'s plenty of \\'vanilla js\\' here (trust me) ok hmmm  maybe an accessible \"where\\'s this in curriculum\" not really bug report but a neutral survey  like add an extra button (that\\'s completely optional) to the completion popup that has \"i\\'d like to leave feedback on this waypoint/bonfire/zipline...base.. before i continue\" camperbot has a very stylish 70s cap... how come no cap merchandising?  nice compact wiki invocation @abhisekp  oh \\'explain\\' is the offending invocation explain turkeys and gravy huh subtract . you know what (that\\'s kind of funny with the penny hoarding thing)? honestly, it\\'s not \\'free quality\\' this is pretty good stuff paid/not paid (or striving to be) yeah, i get the distinction (just adding to). i point that out because you see a lot of economic references (well, of course \\'free\\' is in the name) to this (fcc) and i think it doesn\\'t capture (or maybe it\\'s missed) the quality aspect. freefoodcamp = bad quality yeah this is the hotel california of chat that\\'s black flag i think not the band lol <night></night> lol @abhisekp have you used git blame yet? version control wouldn\\'t work maury if it\\'s still in your browser (without refresh) it wouldn\\'t nope but you could use the javascript interface with imacros on firefox although, i\\'m interested in selenium (have been looking at it from a distance for a while) that\\'s a great distance you can do automated testing or scraping multipurpose  what about wget if that\\'s what you\\'re doing yeah but what was described wasn\\'t automated testing so it\\'s kind of overkill. go with wget maybe  thank with name break with label sure looks like goto eww visual basic flashbacks if they are limited i suppose not that bad but too much if something = \"test\" then goto 20 (vb) 10 lines down could be goto 1 but i see break with label in js and it makes me wonder why one would want to reintroduce that @mhasz239 i\\'m familiar with that (i think my comments reflect that) i\\'m saying it\\'s potentially not helpful if used incorrectly goto in its classic (crappy form) and break (in conjunction with label) in js that looks a lot like goto yeah me either but check this out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/break i was like what? noooo yeah, i know... i\\'m just cautioning against it yep yeah node (or depending on your distro nodejs) on yourfile.js is really quick (my preference, second is repl.it) you can network your external to a desktop and serve your files to your laptop (move some of that stuff onto external so you can use your box) a lot of routers have a usb input how\\'s the performance? with large transfers great article... he really hits the point with: *i bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you’d be fired. even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. it’s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.* nice @jbmartinez local storage works too (i added lard) to onion pie was it difficult ? wait let me answer my own question your code ends on line 303 looks hard yeah i know but, how was working in/with react? @jbmartinez  please don\\'t fuel sequestration lol why the double function declaration  yeah i need to go back and do the newly added js waypoints yes. but you should keep a local copy of your solutions @toninotrip  @jbmartinez \\'s pen *made* me go to [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts)... i had to peek at something before getting to react tutorial lol nan don\\'t do it. you won\\'t be able to eat cheetos and... spandex is costly well, milk it then lol one thing though.... you don\\'t know anything about fitness right? ok, so you could have 179,000 chasing you with torches what if you tell said fitness article consumers to eat two cans of crisco then go for a vigorous run with a bag of potatoes in each hand. wouldn\\'t there be some potential liability there? lol @cshane there was this duo in the early 1990s called milli vanilli. don\\'t be the fitness industry equivalent.  \"he\\'s lip sinking!!\" you have the function invocation commented out @primetimetran why not do both? yeah no, i mean why not complete fcc (which is self paced) and continue your college  i\\'m not talking about app academy @primetimetran what does your inner voice tell you?  welcome @maxwilson  the idea that people are going to pay you a lot of money without scrutiny (or expectation of a high probability that you\\'re going to deliver roi) is ridiculous.  no, no. it costs a lot of money to hire people. (this is even before you get \\'worked\\'). this is prior to the hire (i.e., the scrutiny) that\\'s because they are paying the staffing company a % so, it\\'s *your* hourly plus *their* hourly i\\'m not fond of staffing companies @revisualize they\\'re good for what they are (and it sounds like you\\'re using them as a springboard /resource)... just remember that the end client sees a number different from what you\\'re getting nan nan ah, feel better now. welcome @afjahan  gumpy? lol there are *nix spell check utilities that you can use in bash i have to check out scratch gasp! another night sighting of @arielleslie  i think there\\'s a special chamber you have to use when you\\'ve been away from the nerd collective too long holiday schedules throw me off yeah that adds to it being stuffed and disoriented  yea where do i sign up? can you elaborate? click?  huh you called? i have been reprogrammed  oragami and crochet  ty penguin @sludge256 this is true. (you\\'ve got a lot of folding to do) i wonder where facebook will be in a decade business models change one (of many) similarities among those names is... they were not great coders (sloppy code, blah blah). something to keep in perspective when somebody is nitpicking you.  @jbmartinez he was busy making directory names that allowed spaces @sludge256 just make sure it doesn\\'t involve anything that takes away from your dignity  well i guess if it doesn\\'t involve a stage, you\\'re good. @jbmartinez i would venture to say that gates\\' shrewdness probably outweighed his programming skills in terms of ms\\' early successes (although didn\\'t he come up with dos (not googling, just going from memory) there was a time when people could not imagine their day without a floppy (actually a stack of...). same for business models of today. (just sayin) that internet never has millions of hits when you search something tools icon top @minic94 you have a space in front of cat photos  \\'problem\\' is relative. if you mean will it cause the test to fail? nope.  @minic94 screenshots are difficult to troubleshoot. can you paste your (formatted) code? @minic94 self correcting errors are the best yeah but you\\'re the first wave.... do they have free burgers ? @chan91 yes, follow the map  you want spinning and fading images? hmm oh, lol like a carousal?  although you may want to go css i think you can apply transformations on background (but i see @storbeck lurking ) lol you have a lot of options (and directions to go) but i guess the question would be: what are you trying to do? if you\\'re going for an effect of static background with moving images in their own divs, i\\'m not sure what you\\'re describing would work oh, hang on @cshane  @cshane i think you\\'re describing parallax effect this would be a \\'google it\\' moment though... i\\'m not a css effect ninja noooo @metalhaze don\\'t do it. if you have an intermediary that puts regex into (easy language) i guarantee you\\'ll miss some of the other powerful elements of regex like some things don\\'t translate from gui to terminal (more powerful) ...  i still like hot dogs (no matter what kind of propaganda  i see: they are made from good old \\'mechanically separated\\' parts of good stuff) @evanday17 do you have a pen link? @evanday17 you\\'ve got a couple of options: 1. you can add top margin to your footer class... 2. you can extend your text in about me (because that \\'row\\' (though not declared) /div is controlling the height of your image (so, i\\'d do a combo of both (but, may not be the best way)) winter sucks we would have never known that at least you have backticks nowhere can i find backtick on my mobile (virtual) keyboard  you could try logging out of fcc page (leave the github tab open) then when you login again there will be a button to login with github top. (use that) welcome @drewbyist  no, you\\'re good about @bumpthump  yeah, see it\\'s ok. have you had a lot of coffee today? lol opposite of coffee....hmm whisky? won\\'t i be < size always (since you assigned 0 to it in the preceding line?) i want google to make a flying delorean  googlorean to be nit picky, linux isn\\'t unix (*nix like) not if you\\'re applying effects with jquery it will load before those do anything i\\'d benchmark those side by side but the images are going to load based on network traffic to the src ... no? yeah, but how big are the images? (the first run i don\\'t see how you\\'re going to get those to load faster one vs. the other) but others will chime in i\\'m betting i see a cat wearing a frog costume no i just see it in the people pane @cshane are you thinking along the lines of [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476679/preloading-images-with-jquery) so post?... doesn\\'t that have to do with caching? (i.e., the first time somebody visits your page is their first impression of load time - not the 2nd, 3rd.... ) i could be missing something though just try it see what happens it\\'s not like codepen is going to melt @cshane . experiment a little see what works and what doesn\\'t (although since you\\'re using jquery to manipulate image effects i\\'m not sure how that\\'s going to effect... but i\\'m just speculating) it is soooo friggin cold it\\'s 30 here and slipping into the 20s in a couple of hours sucks wind i want 75 degrees bahamas just kidding nc so, you (all) agree: it sucks. or no. gasp, it\\'s the penguin yeah, pretty much @anthonygallina1 i\\'m not one of those people who are like \"it\\'s so cold, eww i can\\'t get warm\\' but for some reason i\\'m becoming one @abhisekp  yes, that\\'s the wanted poster @sludge256 you mean there\\'s more? i already have endured so much, now i will be wearing big ugly sweaters  penguins eat flesh one day you\\'re sitting on the couch with your pet penguin.. boom it bites your finger off gitter totally lagging ... had to close reopen  lol so you\\'re looking for a hook @allanarmstrong are you sure about the \\'only animal that won\\'t try....\\' part? @allanarmstrong i think swimming off the great barrier reef is not one of my immediate goals no thanks = thanks lol lollol i came across ( a few months ago when it was warm) a copperhead snake (on the sidewalk by hedges!) @rphares could swim with her cousins @jarrpd jump all the way in (and welcome) itunes and cats (the forth pillar) if you have cats giving out the soccer scores (or moderating discussion) you can\\'t lose yes like this ^ oh, you know neko, gato, cats.. etc., they\\'re fuzzy, have four legs,. whiskers, they ignore you ...and um the curriculum starts out with a cat app lol @shaggytech did you look at this https://travis-ci.org/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/builds/100271924 is the length warning pertaining to your file @shaggytech  nvm @shaggytech i see what you\\'re saying (and that was just a warning line not error) hmmm heya @shravanbali  css oh css maybe you need another js file. i imagine the first is creating your server when you run your node \\'app\\' it will tell you if the resource was found. (just stepping back a bit here) by virtue of lack of not found  first issue seems to be pointing to correct directories for his assets but u dunno i  did he do that? can\\'t scroll but u believe you i  f u siri i mean i not u    when i type i mean i  lol and when i ask current temp siri cracks some stupid joke. ok cute the first time uh huh night @rphares thar sucks on so many levels thar? @rphares yeah but  just btw node us pretty cool ain\\'t it? (is) apple you suck @allanarmstrong  thanks there yeah that happened to me @salil999  don\\'t feel bad @rphares i wish you luck through the process   you are making the best of it but it must suck one of cartman\\'s songs is now playing in my head did you leave? w wb @akiralaine  you want one or the other imo if you\\'re running the same function on both events that could cause unexpected behavior. kind of like doing x with key up and down (an thinking in another language paradigm though) am  yeah default is for \\'unknowns/not expected/other\\' patties can i have the patties or no i will wrap them around a steak lol @rphares lies! i ordered from amazon china post and i aged a lot before dilivery js doesn\\'t make sense in a few days make your case in issue report.  this is a weird time slot  @allanarmstrong  node is fun (and can be really unforgiving ) lol have you messed with spawning processes yet (just learned to run bash script from node) via event no node ninja yet but i\\'m digging it spin? like political speak  or marketing speak lol oh sounds weird  does the instructor call you names lol noooo @rphares  ty  no.  you got fail to learn (imo ) these concepts  *to ignore the notes and fail this is progress lol night  these emotes render so funny (when they actually do) on mobile  i vote flow i think @stinger25 \\'s waypoint has a bug @abhisekp  waypoint: manipulate arrays with pop maybe a feature request would be to have users (like in session not chat) be made aware of the the storage thing... infinite loopers lol oooh, even better @abhisekp i like that idea... there\\'s  key/value structure for local storage... why couldn\\'t there be an auto delete replace  oh, that sucks but that\\'s hard to undo (blast syndication with incorrect name by large media) @abhisekp there\\'s a medium article (this guy is using match implementation in a car service context) for local storage...  auto update i\\'d like free doughnuts  like real ones cyber doughnuts don\\'t work for me that leaderboard annoys the hell out of me. if you have your solutions set to private, it\\'s doesn\\'t compute doesn\\'t show my zips, bonfires, etc.  there is no backtick on iphone  @bkinahan yeah on iphone if you hold that down... it pops up a sub menu ( a little tricky ) thanks @bkinahan (brownie points but it is kind of difficult on gitter....apple, you suck) is batman wearing a skirt? (not just a random question: i\\'m talking about @arielleslie \\'s new avatar) lol @arielleslie  how does that work with same name class (because you\\'re bound to have one with same name in all those classes). wouldn\\'t you have to explicitly state precedence? howdy @jbmartinez already jumped to react heya @jbmartinez  so, can i look at react in beta? (fcc beta that is) i would too (and am) what if you get a hardcore js interviewer?  day run into each other days vietnam ruby chat is the hint i get in login makes sense , sense it\\'s xml like since  no i\\'m on mobile about .5 @lexifiatu camperbot\\'s regex is confused by quotes and fused words @chukko1974 welcome (and what did you give it up in favor (of)?) class references css in a file, cdn etc. class=\"someclass\"  the stuff in someclass could be half a world away or in a file in a project folder that\\'s preferred over what\\'s called \\'inline styling\\' ewww @chukko1974 you\\'ll get lots of of skill brush up here (it\\'s fun (and sometimes head banging inducing)) a lot of stuff is \\'minified\\'  before going into production  yeah, there\\'s \\'pretty\\'fiers\\' but you\\'ll have more luck on css than js (i have since learned as i go along) the hershey\\'s kiss folks should sue that (existence of) emote nan nan @the-zebulan when you say table... you\\'re not talking about 1990s type formatting are you? positioning and the like ok, i see what you\\'re saying @the-zebulan ... do you have a pen link? so, freecodecamp news looks like the element (outside the table) that you\\'d want to center are you trying to \\'center\\' the stuff within the row itself? like a sandwich? @the-zebulan yeah this is why i asked if you were using tables... but, (other than probably not the best way in the world and kind of frowned on post 90s) you can try deprecated stuff like http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_tr_align ... or, you could probably style it with css (hopefully) to get the center-within-row look @the-zebulan actually, your page looks pretty good (and this is, technically, tabular data).. @the-zebulan i think switching it up at this point would be counterproductive (and maybe table is the best things (save the image column that makes it not 100% tabular)... you could search 5 column responsive etc., but you may have the best thing really (sorry to be non-committal lol) @glimmerville where are you in the curriculum? yeah, some are more fun than others @glimmerville totally. the barcode (and other code, shopping etc.) recognition with mobile phone cameras is scary accurate me either sounds like youtube time yeah you get more out of that way lol chat part interactive and all i dunno but git should come well before imo so i look at medium but still not following what convo is @anthonygallina1  looked yeah brighten up the text on the buttons a bit... but, its giving me a pretty optimistic forecast... looks good though you can whitelist domains on abplus i don\\'t bother with adblocking on my code related stuff though welcome @orivaa  @takumar did you notice that (certain freebie book bundle no longer available) the json and js code examples are in php ? lol i mean should be .json (had to convert some of the php arrays lol) mern sounds like a syndrome  ! and... it doesn\\'t have the same ring to it. (i.e., w.a.r.m.o.a.t.m.e.a.l could be technically correct (and have all the right components to it) but it just wouldn\\'t sound as cool coffee and stone tablet oh  i think it does on the desktop version of gitter is the free food camp thing still going? (topic wise) typeof evaluates it doesn\\'t convert things parseint can convert \\'1\\' to 1 though but.... strings are immutable so it depends where you\\'re putting stuff (e.g., in another var) it\\'s trying to redirect (albeit slowly) to freecodecamp @sludge256  @eti313 the desktop app sucks what os are you running? i could see the title change in tab; however, it didn\\'t load but \\'looked like a redirect back to fcc\\' @sludge256  you forked it? oh, i see... so, you\\'re running the fork  ... how\\'d you get the domain? @sludge256 (so, it\\'s not redirecting it\\'s just using the same \\'title\\' attribute  wow lol coders who want to get shi^ done use linux @sludge256 did you use namecheap? (whoisguard lol) good idea btw free? like the wind? oh, that\\'s cool that\\'s true i\\'ve been in a hurricane their prices don\\'t look that bad (i don\\'t know about the coupons but, yeah it looks like they have monthly stuff going (in terms of said coupons) https://www.namecheap.com/promos/coupons.aspx) they play subliminal messages while you\\'re on hold i couldn\\'t get it to run.... in page, but i guess you could raw git the the challenges that you\\'re working on (external eval if wanted)  sweet  run is wrong word. i couldn\\' t get page to load i\\'ll have to try a reload, (for whatever reason i\\'m intrigued by your fork to free food camp) lol yeah, no db connection  or null set rather yeah, but still... that\\'s a great learning (like real mechanics ) mechanism that will be helpful in understanding a lot of cra^ under the hood when doing more advanced challenge testing/authoring see ya i bet you could figure out (i don\\'t know the magic formula (or even the topic really, lol)) a practical method of networking contacts without spending a cra^ load of money or w/in some sponsored activity  for that if block yes yeah, those would be separate evaluations ^ href=\"#\" there is no such thing as a </#> tag cats rule the internet it\\'s because there were rooms of cats banging out code in the early 1990s @ajsnetiker there\\'s not a lot of \\'mindless apply button clicking\\' here. when you get to the bonfires (and beyond) you\\'ll be challenged (in a good way). yeah, i would agree with the last couple of comments (but i\\'d suggest repackaging your interview zingers ) lol @aaronk73  ```<p>click here for <a href=\"replacemewithwhatyouwereasked\">cat photos</a>.</p>``` you don\\'t eat pea soup ? kalava? wikipedia  i\\'ve been suckered (yet to receive yarn) lol federation system fcc. interplanetary gift guide 2016.  welcome @yibei  @travishi have you seen how many translation requests (different lang ) are in the issue list? night yep. are you having challenges @filmbandit ? oh ok. you\\'ll have fun and be challenged  :smile:  make sure in your banditing you include kurosawa there are api s for hardware  oh challenge question nvm just as an aside you will see (and i have) hardware interfaces switching to js api b/c of chrome npapi no go now lol tortured phrasing  hey it\\'s january.  holiday season over (most places). well almost over  i\\'ve used yetibyte memory (however, it keeps hiding from view..) incoming wiki explain format slow is not bad. speed doesn\\'t tell you anything about commitment levels, actual dissection of problems, or anything.  learn it: this is isn\\'t a video game (imo)  ty, ty base64 encode images? wow (had to do some webpack reading lol) camperbot is temperamental (has achieved sentience)   bot bot status grrr it changes (different invocations) cbot  camperbot isn\\'t that stoic  there are several progress bars if you look at each section in the map ...

(because in godmode you can just undo the pricing) @jonnyhoeven good luck to you, man @jonnyhoeven you should blog about your experience it will be an interesting contrast to whatever your destiny (and you sound like you\\'re really committed ... so, i think it will be good) may be.  seriously dude, wish you luck with your curriculum (and overall) journey. @politologu can you elaborate? (maybe with the waypoint / code etc., and short description of issue) that\\'s an array what\\'s the issue? ok, what waypoint is this @politologu  @politologu i think they\\'re asking you to create subarrays like ```var mylist = [[\"thing\", 15], [\"something\", 2]  .....];``` i\\'m just giving you an example (not the answer) btw ty @rphares  yes? @politologu do you want to know why it doesn\\'t work? @rphares you\\'re going (coming) back to u.s.? tonight? the ```...``` means continue on (or etc.,) @politologu  so, i gave you what subarrays look like., you need to create 5 of those  ohhhh ok, @rphares  here\\'s an interesting question (at least i think so, because i\\'m thinking it)... is it a good thing to  convert jquery stuff into vanilla js stuff (or near), for learning or (ultimately) production. why? that\\'s what the library is for really... (in other words is it reinventing the wheel?) toggle? to go get lettuce? oh, the gitter lag yeah, it\\'s totally all over the place wow, totally out of sequence sloths have enough problems if you\\'re in a pinch (for the strawberries ) you can melt hershy\\'s kisses (have done this) and some milk.... but you have to watch the heat yeah, they\\'re tasty gasp ^yeah those the folks in pa would disagree with your characterization of their tasty product well there\\'s different geo marketing.... here it \\'looks like that\\' in other places they put in the shape of a kiwi yep they\\'re crunchy nope never heard of timtams american food is generally chipotle burgers, fries have lost a lot of market share (so that\\'s a generalization) the trend is towards fresh food fare (chipotle, custom pizza shops , blah blah) there\\'s a place called 5 guys.... (used to many moons ago eat there) tasty burgers yeah, their fries are cooked in peanut oil (and there\\'s boxes of peanuts all around) there\\'s no external bootstrap reference (maybe you can config in codepen... but i include it b/c i do a lot locally first)... also, when you get to the equal columns part maybe: http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_grid_ex1&stacked=h would help yeah @sludge256 i figured as much.... i use codepen to submit my fcc stuff... but it sucks as a dev tool (more showcase than daily driver) i\\'d be up for putting stickers on my palm rest of laptop... but putting an adhesive backed piece of paper on the gloss on the top part would be a \\'no-go\\' for me like bumper stickers on a nice paint job.... gasp @joeybuczek this wasn\\'t a larger quiz.... @arielleslie was trying to help... oh, nvm lol your plan is sound @sludge256 that\\'s the dude from stargate (series) some people say that the thing on his forehead was part of the character; however, it\\'s just something that stuck to his head... but he\\'s far too menacing to have anybody mention it @qqtpp are you using iframes ? @qqtpp this is the css of that page (you can look in source) http://www.adventuresinwebdesign.com/samples/anchors/blog/main.css another thing.... terminology wise (multi) in this context really is a misnomer --- this /that is more about effect  one of the more ambiguous quotes of the last few posts  @qqtpp you may want to note that there was some jquery stuff going on in the examples that you posted, the link (which looks good) from @noinkling uses css approach.. (may want to factor that in (i.e., avoid potential mixing ...etc.)\\n (overlap, canceling out etc., etc.,) http://regexr.com/ - hint: underscore is not considered punctuation heya @leofib  @sludge256 :wave:  hey, i learned the stinky hand emote (they say it\\'s \\'wave\\' but i know better) i\\'m green? oh, the \\'people list\\' pane works now huh? (i always figured that some folks might be using an irc client or something) sorta kinda oh, is that the permanent fixture avatars? green? like a noob or literally the color green? @rphares i don\\'t think the special diet and robe would fit my workflow... (not \\'chosen\\') wow,  try to keep your disdain a little more localized (i.e., if one person is annoying you... don\\'t be so broadly insulting) @wetwerkz  i know the \\'shake\\' and other effects are simple intros to jquery... but they really don\\'t give a good indication of (which i\\'m finding as i delve deeper) jquery\\'s utility ... like \"oh, isn\\'t that nice\" lol yeah, there are issues  what you say right before the next email comes oh, those are the best it would answer your question *answer* can be perceived as help @valjan fullstack js is pretty expansive in scope but... maybe in a guitar duel with the devil (bad reference to an ancient movie called crossroads) you\\'ll call on both ruby and js to win the duel lol um, dunno... no, ralph macchio and steve vai... not britney uh, huh sure return would terminate the loop @primetimetran i had trouble wrapping my head around this at first as well... looping through (although some other implementation would work).... the elements is kind contrary if you\\'re using filter (and its callback and you\\'re kind of on the right track with what *you don\\'t want*).  because you\\'re comparing one argument against the other in terms of index @primetimetran np. and... no, makes no sense lol you are on the right track in \\'filtering out\\' what you don\\'t want. just the route to get there (if you\\'re  using filter) needs tweaking yeah, and assignment too lol @rakshithnm try taking the last ```break;``` out @primetimetran there are different approaches http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/filtering-arrays-with-array-filter.html yeah indexof will be helpful.... (the background to \\'why\\' it will be helpful will be, well even more helpful) @primetimetran you are not alone in having difficulty with this same here you were watching crossroads (not the cool and most ancient guitar movie) while you were eating huh? lol i\\'m totally not surprised yeah, nice try (@rphares) heya it could be worse @rphares  ok, that\\'s a whole different level of worse notice the pause in chat? walkman(s) ate batteries like no tomorrow i was  same here yngwie malmsteen though was my absolute fav but the \\'head cuttin\\' duel in crossroads (movie) was paganini inspired... only later on did i really appreciate the blues parts that ry cooder played night @sludge256 \\n we\\'ve been over that lol what would the index of an unmatched item be? (socratic ) nope you\\'re just thinking out loud no site works for me. @lookonthebrightside are you not able to access? oh, i saw \\'down\\'  people (including me) underestimate css yeppers there are gaps between milestones like using the waypoints as a measure of what\\'s to come is not going to work lol @lookonthebrightside awesome.  rock on part of the premise of \\'the matrix\\' is actual reality stopped in the late 90s. (oh, how would it suck to be stuck with internet explorer) yes, we\\'re on (in the movie construct) ie 500 now  it still has the \\'e\\' in it (along with an icon that doesn\\'t look much different).... i\\'m glad linux is my primary although on win 10 i use chrome and firefox anyway i skipped on over to firefox early on (back in the day) yep, although... i had a windows 98 machine... the hard drive (including os) was 10gb that machine could barely run puppy linux yep i think my earliest was netscape i liked the default cloud background on 98 and... i saved some backgrounds from ubuntu hardy heron @jordanshackelford there\\'s a kde background based on that... except it has a dinosaur (kind of a commentary on microsoft) running through the field yeah, what\\'s that it\\'s not nice to keep nerds in suspense with nerd things lol are you talking about general protection fault? (when that popped up on google search, it brought back memories) bsod was also another fun microsoft weekly/daily experience welcome chrome (i mean @xingwu1994  looking at the raw data... i don\\'t see date serves me right for not looking at the data with a json formatter @evaderei yep, there\\'s a unix timestamp in there (as @akiralaine pointed out) you can get the full date out of it (although the year looks a little tricky (on the converter i used it was in 5 digit form (but you can get that converted too)) @michael-krebs ever use blender? (don\\'t know if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for) it\\'s full 3d though, steep learning curve yeah, it is if i had the time i\\'d learn it... (yeah, way heavy for what you probably want to do @michael-krebs ) non web.... but \"what the hey\" i\\'m going to download blender lol wow, wireframing tools (web) are really expensive good grief whiteboard and marker yeah, @thelittleblacksmith no kidding yeah, there\\'s often (the wireframing thing has been around in other contexts) stuff that doesn\\'t translate there are some things that are really process intensive (usually backend / admin) for this stuff i use semantik or other mind-mapping software @raghuchandrasekaran do you mean running js (e.g., https://repl.it/languages/javascript, invoking node on file, \\'the console\\'...etc.,) or do mean something else? @rphares http://www.bk.com/menu-item/veggie-burger @raghuchandrasekaran package shows dependencies (mocha, chai...) etc., what are you running into (specifically)... (also, interesting... what\\'s the impetus for running tests this way?) css is a pita (random rant about css) btw the veggie burger is tasty (so, i\\'m only half joking) it\\'s not: \"what has css done to me?\" but.... \"what does css do in spite of me?\" also, one more note on the veggie burger: it is no substitute for tasty flame broiled beef product @raghuchandrasekaran i\\'m wondering what you\\'re getting in terminal etc (i\\'m not a unit testing expert so keep that in mind)... you have simple files in your project... but *what* are you invoking on specific functions etc. http://webapplog.com/tdd/ ? drop the quotes around key name i\\'m not saying the quotes are *the problem* lol @skoolboi later on (when you get past return) maybe quoting (good, bad or indifferent) may be helpful to note: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12991969/js-object-keys-with-or-without-quotes they\\'re real. i think fcc staff coordinates between you and the non-profit (when you get to the point of being qualified (curriculum requirements)... i\\'m not there, yet though sometimes (on the non-profit portion) fcc principles come into chat (they\\'re pretty responsive in terms of answering questions... so, i don\\'t have a lot of doubt about the \"realness\" of the project portion of things @domhigh that\\'s great to hear @lomu99 i\\'m not sure (but i think this is the same waypoint)... but did you add a function name? (i.e., you should only be declaring variables (no functions)  in the example... one outside of a function and one (purposely without *something*) penguins have a high metabolism  maybe there\\'s a revolt against \"mobile first\" and that image load is just part of the new (old) paradigm \"monster monitor size first\" @edurocha2005 typically you reference class in the element like ```class=\"yourclass\"``` maybe (haven\\'t looked at that waypoint in awhile) @edurocha2005 think of the ```.something{yourcssstuff}``` as the declaration of things and the ```class=\"something\"``` (in the tag itself) as the invocation of that nan @sludge256 got me thinking about bill lumbergh ty ty echo: camperbot says a lot @conradbo the ```switch(val)``` gives you the value to compare against (you don\\'t have to use val===(n)... you can shorten that to: case 1: , case 2... \\n```\\ncase 1:\\nanswer =\"whatever\";\\nbreak;\\ncase 2:\\nanswer =\"anotherwhatever\";\\n``` explain format @skoolboi ^ has to go between the backticks i vote avacado oh but avocados are so pretty and expensive you could obfuscate your face in an image of an avocado i\\'m just throwing out ideas welcome @becorry  yeah, set the opacity to 30%  basic (then visual basic) here nan although fcc gitter will suck you in  dang: it seems shutterstock has already gone with the face superimposed over avocado idea nan yep, it is you can use ctes etc., there\\'s a lot of functionality in ms sql server (one of the few things ms does really right) hey, those are great hours for reporting...  @travishi do not be discouraged: you can call upon the power of \"the mullet\" at any time (keanu avatar) you must *believe* in mullet power for it to work lol what\\'s it holding now? @jbmartinez (other than it\\'s the evil leaderboard) that looks great (you\\'ve got react, media queries, rock-and-roll) lol, no... i like it: very clean exactly the opposite of the ugliest zipline creature i\\'ve been styling all day make sure to tell hr not to post years of experience greater than the actual existence of the technology  ship it @jbmartinez i\\'m going to bet @abhisekp is already envisioning a \\'special fork\\' of your pen where he is in that slot  lol lol yeah, going through the react stuff ....i was like wow @jbmartinez could that be deployed to heroku? hacksaw above the bolts but, that\\'s an irreversible office chair mod yeah, i didn\\'t think of that @spatzerny you have to account for avatar\\'s \\'scale factor\\' (i.e., when scaled down) lagging yep @spatzerny looks great (although the belt looks like a mouth) entirely subjective though revlon could be catering to the stylish ninja market segment yeah, that\\'s scaled up (remember the scaled down aspect) nan nan ok, that\\'s better yeah, no that\\'s actually scary lol i\\'m on the fence about listening to music while coding (or other focus intensive effort)... it kind of distracts me nan i wonder if tracy ullman is bitter about short animated clips in her show becoming iconic  what are the dots? i scaled it down, it looks like a beard welcome @zholt3  @cheesecast can you recommend a good cheese? nan if you\\'re new at something, why is the first (for some) thought (when something doesn\\'t work)\"it\\'s a bug!\" vs. (what did i do wrong?) not that there aren\\'t bugs lol @chrisdziewa the bug distinction i\\'m making is \\'bug report\\' lol yeah totally..@sludge256 same here.... out of sequence i can\\'t use relative chat posts to respond with the sequence breaks... so, now have to tag.... ty, ty @rphares  @ykocak89  usage (in tag) ```class=\"yourclass\"``` also it\\'s ```learnyounode``` sudo is for admin tasks (like installing packages) (at the os level that is) nan f12 (chrome) i can\\'t take somebody holding two red snappers very seariously but i agree thanks @sludge256  this isn\\'t 80s truck driving school @kmiasko  nice amazing what you can do without jquery and pure css what some can do that is lol @omh11 pure speculation will probably not work (you could link the pen) yes, adjust the padding.... sorry, misunderstood your question (and this is something i encountered thinking back) @omh11 bootstrap is a bit involved (beyond your first hurdle... the point (i think) is for you to research, research)....  c is used in the linux kernel (granted gcc and whatever c programmers would argue etc.) and there\\'s a high probability a lot of the resources being served (at any given time web wise) is coming from a linux server upstream wait @jedpimentel they do have exercise bikes (safer, at least in advanced age) so, you went with caution tape? nan no dev is making millions a year (unless he/she is a majority stockholder or running the company) so, you think microsoft is super innovative then? (i mean part of their early strategy (and other tech companies really do the same thing) was to acquire other companies with tech that they could use) you should ask google \"how do i make a compelling argument\" first @spatzerny i like the caution tape but .... i thought a melding of cyborg and ninja might be also cool nan also, prepare to eat ramen  (in general keep seeing \\'startup\\' as salvation, which it could be... and it might not be) lol @crazypkr1099 this is an opensource project, you could write some stuff, talk to the folks in curriculum dev...etc., clearly you\\'re mega talented and we could all benefit from your mastery of all things dev related @codingwarrior welcome welcome @charlesstaniszewski  yeah but you contributed stuff to the actual curriculum  lol javascript section is kind of like groundhog day, i\\'ve completed it... then find i haven\\'t (new stuff added) then, complete it again. first codecademy, then v.1.0 , then v1.1 it\\'s a reflection of reality though...

(it\\'s fast (i don\\'t have it though) in fact i ....)  no pun in re-coup @eniergray jquery *is* javascript... the same comparison operators apply  you need to work on your \\'encouragement factor\\' lollol @storbeck is exceptionally good with css.  but, css is difficult for many (of us) @travishi the way of the mullet does not include \\'reacting\\' to nonconstructive criticism  lol @travishi  hypnotized  @sludge256 nice. (i figured i\\'d probably would be lazy not to post it lol) i call myself that on my new code @atan77 both/all @gndamiao ```.someclass``` would look like this (without the .): in the tag ```class=\"someclass\"``` @gndamiao step 1: gear next to title in each pane...\\nbrings you to pen settings. \\nselect tab: css\\n(some stuff should already be included but,)\\nselect \\'quick-add\\' then bootstrap\\' @gndamiao step 2: the class thing that i was mentioning earlier... the ```.``` in front of a class name is its declaration... don\\'t include the dot in the tag.

@re4ect the map is in a pullout (sidecar) window  i can see map but.... the actual challenges seem laggy @abhisekp lol me too (i was trying not to be too critical, but i don\\'t like green on white) hurts my eyes lol yeah, there\\'s activity ---------> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:jaws_james_bond.jpg abba is ideal for coding yeah @re4ect codecademy is good for repetitive stuff (reinforcement etc); however, it lacks structure  a lot of collapsed/nesting stuff with the map now interesting riddle.... but, not every  function returns a value (some paradigms, a subroutine ). .i.e., they *do something*. (in js i believe these are called side effects).  ty ty oh, penguin one @bkinahan has a special keyboard @meletisf what\\'s the output tell you? i use virtualbox (and vmware) yeah, i have run a lot of linux guests in virtualbox over a long period of time w/o issue (although some distros can be a bit moody with guest editions) linux is my primary os (with kde) however grumpy cat,  lol gasp welcome @yasinya  have coffee.... so, not bad  @keccakec a day with coffee is a good day indeed i would disagree on the bootstrap orientation (it\\'s more of an introductory mechanism) however, yep this is \\'rock and roll javascript\\' all the way i\\'m getting map whiplash things change a lot (and this is good (i.e., constant improvement :+1: ) but the curriculum requirements do , sort of , look like the castle in krull (always moving)) at times nan @jcsgithub the distinction is benchmark (as in to attain cert) vs. changing tech (which, obviously, is the case in dev) welcome person @darrylpargeter  that looks like @darrylpargeter  so, you\\'re not @darrylpargeter  i knew it oh, you had to invoke the wiki gasp i\\'m pretty sure @rphares just said programmers are lazy lol i don\\'t think it\\'s lazy to automate something that may be sucking up my higher-order thinking that\\'s programming :metal: :meat_on_bone: :metal:  i couldn\\'t find a meatloaf emote @rphares no, i\\'m just joking.... most are yes i don\\'t know much about bitcoin (or crypto currency in general) at first blush, it seems a brilliant idea.. because nobody wants to be \"the dumb one\" to ask: \"where\\'s the value?\" @gaegeroot on some level, that is true @gaegeroot i sense a monetary discussion coming (gold standard etc.,) ... lol i\\'ve been on the planet awhile welcome @obradovicm  @jbmartinez sugar coated caramel will get you there quick caramel = melted sugar what\\'s the topic? (regurgitation? )  ewww yeah, i\\'m lost too elvis loved peanut butter and banana sandwiches. hard to disagree with him on that not costello (although awesome too, but not that kind of awesome) @abhisekp you must have seen my photoshop of the hat  lol @oribon say what you\\'re really thinking lol same here... (delivery goes a long way) here\\'s the thing about constructive... have some ideas/suggestions to go along with (e.g., saying \"that sucks\" is less effective than \"that, could suck less maybe if you did x and y\") @oribon we all have our own style. i\\'m just saying in a lot of team environments there\\'s a difference between being a \\'d\\' vs. being direct paid /corporate etc. here\\'s the rest of the cipher: ouche walt disney (could be argued) had a lot to do (inspiration wise) with today\\'s animae @rphares what are you doing again? @zohairakhtar you don\\'t need coding to feel that nan nan noextraspacestoweighdownperformance oooh i like @rphares do they sell cheetos in china? @abhisekp :+1:  india\\'s embrace of \\'the cheetos\\' @rphares you must slowly reintroduce yourself to staples like cheetos (although there are lots of great specialty markets) see, slowly but surely the cheetos fans will reveal  i like hummus on steak ? <----trying to interpret @itsalbow \\'s comment lol nevermind @itsalbow  context makes that less funny (keep it on its own line) there are a lot of really great foods (even veggie ) cheetos is in its own class or cheeto or chee\\'tai (can\\'t think of the singular ) ^knows *temporal dead zone and errors with let* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/let updating resume (pretend i put the accents) is a pita @oribon you should have different versions depending on requirements.... i think i listened to, too many career centric podcasts  nan welcome @purplezerg  @samosale that looks interesting thanks @samosale  (wait for it.... brownies)  oh, that would suck (having codepen \\'feature\\' your pen while it\\'s in progress) nan nan i can\\'t flood the chat with bach enjoying cheetos... lol you can invoke sir mix-a-lot? what about an \\'un-collapse\\' feature for the map (i\\'d vote for this)? like an option yeah @bkinahan  i\\'m beginning to wonder if earbuds (insert mobile phone accessory here) cause ear infections new! iearoooze @hexicle focus on the learning first @mdhalim what kind of character encoding is that (looks a lot like ms word on the quotes) those aren\\'t utf-8 compliant by the way @luishendrix92 knows @jesuschryslersuperstar welcome (you get points for melding 70s and 80s into a single username) thanks @jesuschryslersuperstar  nan nan wait, the button is not black anymore (unless you hover with -moz) nan brackets and geany try as many editors as you can (seriously though, you can\\'t evaluate an editor\\'s features in a day) yeah, it\\'s not \\'cool\\' to recommend brackets.... but i dig it  sublime is the fastest though (imo) @olbanana linux is infinitely better than windows (and mac imo)... and fits the \\'epic good for free\\' description @cshane i get the feeling (by different documentation) you should choose one *or* the other (i.e., media queries vs. js for window sizing)... but if you\\'re looking to get complimenting (note: i haven\\'t tried this) http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/cssmediaqueries4.shtml functionality  btn is an empty holder (needs to be clarified with additional classes (e.g, btn btn-default btn-lg) (not necessarily your checkpoint though) yeah i clarified my remarks btn btn-block i haven\\'t seen this (in awhile) but you have to have btn then the actual descriptive button classes in bootstrap (btn is like the outer thing.... the stuff the follows is *type of button* my guess is if you go into the minified stuff you\\'ll see btn has the setup for stuff  the other stuff i\\'m going to use four instances of \\'stuff\\' in my next post @codingducky there\\'s a process flow for that kind of stuff dodge dart @codingducky  https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug pm\\'ng principles (or the principle) of a dev team is not the way to deal with bugs seriously learn this first. https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug @pathologicallylogical welcome back  not welcome back....

yeah go to settings in virtualbox for that vm how much ram is allocated (and what\\'s the total host ram) yeah that\\'s non optimal (you should get a warning that 50% of available ram is allocated but is probably unrelated to your vm issue) can you get a terminal?

checking the iso integrity etc.,) and the installation process runs... you should be fine (however, you may want to google uefi etc. (toshiba and other newer stuff http://askubuntu.com/questions/566120/how-to-install-ubuntu-and-boot-on-toshiba-satellite) @varenigmatic do you have a single machine or can you do stuff with two ? if you have another machine, i\\'d recommend (for linux unetbootin, for windows rufus) you burn the iso to a usb and install from there btw vms are great (i have a few (in addition to dual boot))... good for sandboxing as well as testing distros , and a bunch of other stuff ```\\n//you mean like this (like the checkpoint?)\\nvar z =\"this is some \";\\nz += \"text\";\\nconsole.log(z);\\n``` @granite1 ^ https://repl.it/be8k @bakmo you\\'re going to need a conditional to test whether a or b are < 0 xml is not dead lol @ultramun welcome (you also, took me back like 30 years with your avatar) that\\'s really \\'kaizen\\' (conceptually) and has been around since the mid 1980s lol yep gitter is flaking on me big time brb @qmikew1 no you\\'re not @travishi  you\\'re \\'ok\\' yep, better start practicing pushing a penny up a door (and watch out for the guy on the subway)  (movie: ghost) i can see @spatzerny  i think it\\'s the caution tape and pencil that detracts from the ninja camouflage  hence detection that\\'s a kind of fish they use in imitation crab legs i saw an interesting take on scrollspy type stuff (you scroll through page and progress is in a lateral bar) kind of cool btw @spatzerny i stared at the image and did not see a rabbit @spatzerny interesting function names lol well, they are descriptive i think the overall effect is diluted when diagrammed  it\\'s a test of subjective interpretation.

(vs. search of of search engine... lol) in python @dhruvkrverma throw some record titles in an array, then use python to allow user to search titles. bim, bam, done. i\\'m half joking, but that *could* work (after all this is a js stacked based curriculum and you should be learning fcc - based on where you\\'re chatting)  @dhruvkrverma @ixmohamedy good luck (and coming back to things is good)  it\\'s better not to \\'front\\' and be honest and say \"this stuff can be difficult\" (imo) you\\'ll have a better chance of success. acknowledge and move forward... yeah, grumpy cat... eat lots of humble (and crap) pies... it propels you forward lol @abhisekp have you worked on your spring theme? welcome @mimi2014  i like the floral notes part.... can\\'t support the engineered pearls (only because i think they use a lot of yanni music to irritate oysters (or clams i\\'m not an expert) into producing the pearls @abhisekp i\\'m gonna look at script later today @qmikew1 not ignoring @rphares (in fact, will pay extra attention) just as an aside, if you claim an level of familiarity with (any) language... you *have to* spell it correctly. hr people, and clients are funny about that (credibility and all) lol. \"i detal oooriented\" <--- would be another \\'red flag\\'.  @qmikew1 there is no purple: it\\'s only your imagination  helpful penguin so, are you still in china? yeah, a bit overwhelming i would imagine yes @amenshamen yes, there was a significant change in ui (and other stuff) @amenshamen there are a million \\'old versions\\'; however, none that you can interact with (and save your progress) to my knowledge hey, that\\'s a fox (literally) mullet power! i wonder what it would be like if chris farley were cast as neo  @mindfulbell are you testing locally or c9 @mindfulbell i\\'m not speaking specifically to your challenges (new terminology) ;however, node isn\\'t difficult to install (on linux pretty easy npm etc.)  hmmm @mmacedoeu hey... @mindfulbell i guess, in that case, you\\'d have to google \\'c9 alternatives\\'... (i see some stuff; however, haven\\'t used (i like local) so can\\'t give a recommendation ) if you invoke the wiki too often, you know what happens? @kkrugler that\\'s kind of a high level thing (there are \\'bug\\' routes; however, they\\'re paired at the challenge level (contextual)). i guess you could critique  doh, @rphares \\' link is what you want i\\'m almost 100% certain that @rphares has some some sort of borg flipper implant i think (somehow, i\\'m not really clued in on borg technology) you slap your flipper onto the keyboard and the neural path quickly types out what you want yeah, don\\'t use initial checkpoints as a gauge for the entire course: there\\'s a drop off (i.e., you go straight to much more difficult stuff) should add that too (the fun part)  neither is <hr> (so far) lol maybe the reason (and i\\'m too lazy to google) is because a lot of things are \\'responsive\\' (e.g., bootstrap) and there\\'s less of a \\'common dimension\\' things flow automatically...and <br> can look weird sometimes  your layout will change based on viewport @mbrincrim  @mbrincrim that could affect your desktop implementation (i.e., somebody views your site (in mobile and they, also, have a large desktop monitor) they\\'re likely to make judgments (fair/unfair)  about your overall offerings not everything can be mobile (these are usually specialized corporate things) that shouts \"needs to be mobile friendly\" (i.e., learning a language (even classical)) people do that \"on the go\" do people have to sit by fireside while using this ? \"it\\'s silly to assume\".... yes, please bring several pound of books while on the go.  i\\'m not arguing for a primary resource... (and yes, i\\'ve done research) you\\'re arguing for less access to your application. that\\'s \"just silly\" yes, with the question \"how do i center text\"?  i\\'m inclined to believe that the mobile aspect is being rejected more out of a lack knowledge vs.  some well thought out approach to how deliver something (language learning) on multiple devices (and multiple folks).  but hey, to each their own.  i added that earlier (not everything can be done on mobile (e.g., corporate stuff... this is true in an academic setting as well)... somehow the irony of talking about a collaborative application and rejecting anything that doesn\\'t meet preconceived ideas (in the scope of learning concepts to apply) slipped by unnoticed.   @abhisekp i noticed something weird about gist(s): you can easily fork but it\\'s difficult to clone (even though there\\'s a bunch of github stuff saying you can like a repo) single files onto local @gilalexandel https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop that sucks but is the case in a lot of places @gilalexandel i\\'m a linux person... and that, i think, will get you started. if you\\'re looking to dev for desktop apps on windows js isn\\'t your route w3\\'s name is part of their problem it\\'s like naming a company closely to something else like \"microsofft\" you\\'re looking for some sort of plug-and-go app maker for windows without c--- # .net.. all that fun stuff? @deaninous that doesn\\'t look like a project directory you\\'re in/on desktop (and not in a project folder) @deaninous that\\'s not going to help... where\\'s the project folder? in a sub directory? cd workingpol @gilalexandel i think you may need to read through some of that site. the basic idea is framework (in all its ms porky\\'ness) helps you to churn out something close to what you want to do (again, this is coming from a linux person) @deaninous please post your question here (there are a lot of folks that can answer) nan lol ok you changed directory great @deaninous  javascript is the language that drives node it\\'s server side js i think the initial npm error is more telling  @deaninous hmmm maybe? https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init i\\'m just confused by the package.json you had outside your project folder (on desktop)  how was that created? @deaninous check back if that doesn\\'t work @allanarmstrong can probably throw some hints  dude, the coffee idea is great if i could drink coffee while sleeping i would yeah, there\\'s that but... you\\'re learning for you  you mean like a direct coffee drip in the medical sense (and not the usual \\'drip coffee maker\\')? i think a big plastic bag full of coffee would make people uncomfortable and they\\'d point and stuff i think that would be opaque and the coffee would look like a big bag of well... @dubh3124 that\\'s awesome... there\\'s this weird (at least this is how i perceive) attitude about js (and now its related implementations) that has sort of a 1990s feel to it.  i had it too but this shi^ is bad^^^ yes install the dependencies make life easier btw this is a broader construct in *nix like systems (if you decide to switch to linux ) that npm kind of draws inspiration (dependencies , checking etc) buzz phrase for the new age : there\\'s an api for that camperbot gets no love the nesting was a bad idea (imo) no.  the checkpoints @codingducky  yeah the analogy would be \"hey if i fold this flyer into different sizes will it still look good? omg ty ty @rphares is wesley snipes they\\'re gitter emotes no paste  like no bake cookies penguin power :metal:  lol i was talking about linux lol just kidding lol @sludge256  ty ty actually mint (historically) is a derivative of ubuntu (and *is* debian based) you can install all the restricted media packages (and whatever desktop you like) in ubuntu (i don\\'t dislike mint, but a lot of the arguments for it are kind funny) @arielleslie have you ever come across an application process where it states \"all info is completely voluntary\" yet the form validation won\\'t let you continue? lol asset hosting screams \"medium \" i have come across such a process (however, pointing out bad design in early phase of things can be tricky lol) @samosale a blog entry... the question of asset hosting comes up time and time again @jacksinatra @jbmartinez  lives in an authoritarian state with challenging work dynamic @samosale  yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m saying \"somebody should write a medium post on asset hosting\" wait until the machines take issue with being called \"hunk of metal\" nobody asked him brackets... ftw *and geany* trusty go to @rphares did you say you shipped all of your shoes away (yes, late reply to an ancient thread) nan odd and different from yesterday (time out) i can login.... but sllllllllllow this (what you\\'re communicating through now) is different (gitter) ... the fcc site is slow atm dunno c9 yeah, c9 has issues @keccakec bleh... what\\'s your setup? :metal: <---only emote i can bring myself to use (and maybe the stupid happy face ) @keccakec do it. things are a lot easier in linux (imo) irony of the emoji question sigh type colon then select @keccakec yep ubuntu (waits for distro flame) is the least pita distro (and you\\'ll actually get some stuff done) red flag distro verbiage  if your distro requires you to genuflect, there are issues  unity sucks, install kde, dwm, cinnamon, mate or anything else  @shifthawke  you\\'ve been mia for a really long time how are you bat friend? not too bad  shi..y cold  noooo snow sucks people get all weird when it snows. they\\'re are mobs at grocery and gas.  ah much better (vs. horrid mobile experience) that\\'s a hat? is that scooter from the love boat wait, what was his name it wasn\\'t scooter it was gopher sheesh wtf if you say it over and over you turn into a gremlin doesn\\'t work on penguins (apparently, there\\'s is a close association already_ hey, isn\\'t that the lady from back to the future wait, there\\'s some sort of \\'ylvis\\' caption... so, no it\\'s not the lady from back to the future what\\'s a ylvis is it something one would need to take anti-inflammatory  fine, i will google this \\'ylvis\\' @eeflores i\\'m reading up on it now apparently it\\'s some sort of person with dual personalities and a fondness for steak sauce there has to be a darwin award for that dude sitting on his tank with front wheel up ooh, clickable carets nice ---> ^insurance rates <---using directional communication @danstockham unless you\\'re doing some sort of logic... .append does just that (i.e., each time it\\'s invoked it \\'does\\') pre-sort i should say @yanghwa howdy @danstockham maybe you could pass into array (do a sort) then pull and append? don\\'t be nervous it\\'s just code nan just kidding lol trying to break the ice it\\'s ok, we all get nervous i think gitter is laggy (atm) what say you people? wait @danstockham so, let me see if i\\'m understanding correctly you\\'re getting stuff and it\\'s immediately appended and not in alphabetical order right? wall of code btw way @danstockham i input ```test``` as the string and got some funny results ok, wait .... let me look  @danstockham ok, now i see what you\\'re saying (you got the first part ) you\\'re looking for the title + summary (the summary part you don\\'t have) @danstockham the fcc pen loads all at the same time too @danstockham yeah i was going to say http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_eff_slideup_slidedown (i\\'m also keeping true and not looking at the source) @putmyrobeonrite that\\'s a good question ... these are the results i get (it\\'s more a do\\'s and don\\'ts -- i\\'m always kind of looking for the elusive style guide too) http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages @putmyrobeonrite if you\\'re adding files, not sure sequence (b/c it\\'s all wrapped in the whole git construct thing) matters on the \\'initialness\\' of it (i.e., there\\'s not much weight by order etc., ) so, yeah... you\\'re probably right why not?  yeah i can understand that: (you don\\'t want people snickering at you and all) lol lot of names starting with u not a lot of creativity in character names (like steven seagal movies, (somebody pointed out once that the guy with the sticks was called \"sticks\" the guy with the tattoos was called tattoo))   どこに字幕がありますか？ hey, @sludge256 you\\'re in the people panel nice via terminal? what is this voodoo i tried hexchat (not terminal) but irc client.... couldn\\'t get the main room to work even main (this)? i\\'ll have to go back and tweak my settings gitter is a bit porky (in extra stuff client wise) @sludge256 though not terminal based (and like lynx doesn\\'t support js) i\\'ve used dillo on hobby type machines radish  squash welcome @muntasir2165  i\\'m going with squash hops barley are both eww don\\'t do ad copy for beer brewers lol i think the leafy greens don\\'t stay \\'leafy\\' once you chew and swallow (one would hope) @joeybuczek i\\'m hoping you have a heimlich chart near by (if you\\'re not chewing greens ) lol lololo welcome at least go with geany....  well, if it\\'s gedit vs. geany i\\'d go with geany (although i use brackets) and geany sublime is the fastest (anecdotal)  but even though it\\'s not the fastest, i prefer brackets i want actual pumpkin pie in all its pumpkin spice goodness @sludge256 \\'testing\\' lol now i feel bad for reading (what amounts to ) git style guides, specific repo, dos-don\\'ts .... when i could have just plunged right in on the staging branch lol yeah, never go cheap on a plunger and razors (no relationship between the two other than quality being exposed quickly) \"hello candidate, can you explain your plunger comment?\"\\n is it me or are a companies (i.e., those that you give your email for whatever service) becoming mor e aggressive with \"reminders\", \"helpful-hints\", \"general-prodding\" etc.? welcome @acediant  nope  \\'not found\\' @wimhuiskes if you have the value (before var) re var the 2nd var (there\\'s no in place \\'undo\\') your replace is likely a modified instance held in a secondary staging var... just,  redo the pattern  batperson honda cbrs are great (dependable  i had one many moons ago) used to it\\'s been about a decade of no moto for me.... life is cruel lol maybe it\\'s wrecked weird that the last two digits of mileage isn\\'t shown you also want to consider buying a sportbike from somebody over 30  yeah, it\\'s hard (the sportbike segment is by virtue less responsible .... but there are geriatric owners  you can buy from....) sometimes @bruceredden welcome back from the darkside i was trying not to use squid lol but yeah it\\'s friggin good @neo-email008 sounds a bit beyond scope (php with a payment thing) : this is js stack based read the docs?

ty ty @sludge256 my mom had that in the 80s omg sitting on the (dial control) microwave @rphares we now know you have that (classic) recipe book i just traveled back in time now remembering 80s formica kitchens basically smooth surface glued to particle board  nan now i feel complete what? i\\'m like ancient  of course ubuntu mostly (or anything debian based)  nan lol dude i\\'m picturing half a bag of granulated sugar being poured into that (classic ) pitcher  how-dy i remember that commercial where the pitcher ran around and sang \"oh, yeah\" it was a take off on slowed recordings to get deep effect around that time yep @varenigmatic i don\\'t think the people of massachusetts would appreciate you calling them that  kool-aide man was originally called pitcher man  only if you have collector bank (cars i remember as being sort of crap^^ are now becoming collectables) mullet power see the power of the mullet? if you\\'re talking about what the kernels that run the servers (linux) then yeah i\\'d somewhat agree with you @varenigmatic  (backend) linux isn\\'t unix not really *nix like @joannesalfa yep, that\\'s somewhat true... but linux can be found in both (x86 \\'desktop\\') and in data centers. unix doesn\\'t exist in both.... (and torvalds \\'borrowed\\' from unix... they\\'re not the same) @sirunclecid i agree with your earlier characterization jeez @ghodmode you got both certs? snow this weekend. people freak out. got the last 3 bananas deja vu ty ty (btw snow sucks) @shifthawke so, are you snowed in? npm install patience by a penguin no less ewww he\\'s mochi seriously google mochi in images and you will see a stack of \\'mochi\\' top left looks just like @sludge256  \\'s avatar mochi, is awesome huh why the array.prototype... approach? ^ +1 for easily following in your code delivery person? take out @rphares we have to talk about your brownie diet lollol yeah, that would imply restraint with the brownies i still haven\\'t been able (though github swears in their docs you can do) to clone (can fork etc.) a gist file onto local yeah, copy paste... but the clone thing bugs me i think it has something to do with ankles use gitter markdown if it\\'s a wiki type thing @qmikew1 agrees with @hermanfassett  i think you\\'d have to do git raw to render (there\\'s a service you can use) full html; however, for basic (gitter/github (same thing)) markup you can use the same in the markdown button -> which version why welcome @raziyehbazargan  lol :+1:  for stealing greeting i wonder if i should go to the grocery store (i literally got the last three bananas (not counting the one bag of minis) not even on the same bunch. people don\\'t deal with snow well here @steezykaay you\\'d probably have (at the end of this) have the skills to qualify for a junior fe dev position. starting a company is more of an entrepreneurial question and isn\\'t, necessarily, related to skills (but doesn\\'t hurt)... but that\\'s a tall order/expectation to place on learning js stack  (i.e., two separate things).  @syamantaknaskar can you elaborate (e.g., checkpoint name, is it part of the exercise (i.e., perhaps it\\'s your code)? or are you having a problem with images loading in general? better to paste with formatting explain format @syamantaknaskar ^ paste (formatted) *all* of the/your code there\\'s also the super-ugly code option (however you may not want that) why is your img src in the style section? (hint) heya and welcome @adonisarun  @wimhuiskes console.log(stuff); will output all the stuff you specify. are you viewing console.log through your browser\\'s console? (that outputs a lot of logging information independent of any exercises etc.,) @wimhuiskes native way to clear is console.clear in chrome just type clear() can you post an example of the (non-desired) output? @wimhuiskes what\\'s your code? (i.e., it looks like a loop generating) i think you\\'re looping a var in console.log(); @wimhuiskes , @michael-krebs \\' suggestion about testing it in repl.it is a good one: if you\\'re getting the same result in repl.it, then we can isolate your issue to code (or not). i think there\\'s something in your function (or functions) that\\'s outputting what you don\\'t want; however, it\\'s hard to tell because all of the code hasn\\'t been posted... @wimhuiskes what checkpoint is that? that extra output (by your screenshot) is being generated by the exercise evaluation (i believe) if you note, the red x shows that array\\'s contents. i think it\\'s more side effect to the fail on the second requirement. so, yeah you\\'re getting additional output (in addition to your console.log()) @vishul-saini it\\'s an elaborate way to tell if you have been keeping up with things (just joking) @wimhuiskes here\\'s your code in repl.it https://repl.it/bgnp .... so, you\\'re getting the return value (which will show). your output in console (via browser) is just showing what\\'s in the console.log() calls (within the loop)... (i.e., you don\\'t have a console.log() of your function itself) \\'ello as an aside, snow (my new rant) sucks np hope it worked out (or was somewhere near what you wanted to know) i wish the snow would melt  like now ty ty @rphares .... @shifthawke what? just ice? that\\'s only 1/2 a part of the state away ice sucks too @jalexandergibson  welcome bienvenida, ten cuidado con javascript : es el mal también , cobol es el futuro @shifthawke nope... let\\'s see it that\\'s a sweet helmet. (pretty glossy.... bug magnet) @shifthawke it looks good on the venting (way at the bottom it says it\\'s dot compliant (i think they all have to be ...but i dunno).... it doesn\\'t give 360 view i went to market a couple of days ago.... got the last three bananas  people have to have bread... and all the other crap *that you\\'re supposed to have* monster lines  seriously people @rphares if it\\'s snow apocalypse, you can put perishables in the snow (but that\\'s the least of your problems lol)  and beef jerky and tang are good at anytime not just when it snows now i want beef jerky and tang.... i will have to pay $800.00 for a slim jim though at this rate macho man randy must have known it would be the new currency  @rphares he was (now deceased ) a wrestler of the wwf era. (macho man randy savage)  sigh now it\\'s snowing, i have no beef jerky (or tang)... and i\\'ve been reminded of the passing of macho man ...thanks @rphares  yes, consider it grief brownie lol i tried subjective c; however, it had too many anecdotal constructs the snow is getting to me: i\\'ve been drinking generic-supermarket brand coffee for two days i am yes but not in the worst part.. (for snow that is...i\\'m in nc) still sucks though, people get all weird you suck @masterjdnc (i\\'m kidding and am jealous that you\\'re on the coast) wait, this person... forked and presented as their own?   that\\'s an alien not a hat this person is *brilliant* why i\\'ve never seen anybody average four ziplines a day and complete both front and back certs in around two weeks. nope, nothing to see there yep he should be interviewed on twitch lol or she yeah same here probably, a time thing.....(i.e., not enough time for those folks that do ) to review. there should be a red-flag (on say a certain amount of time that things were completed... use an average (for now, there\\'s not a huge number to gather an average yet...so pick something) the fork is brazen (because it\\'s built in tracking kind of like github) and not just copy paste (which can also be read for pattern matching to check on things) have been meaning to check out cheerio (in the stack of things) like for months @luishendrix92 that looks pretty cool (i think you were talking about it before in data science) @luishendrix92 i may have to read something like https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js to get the background (even though what you\\'ve got is really clean and straight forward)  checkpoint has a real east berlin flavor to it (i prefer the old terminology ) you stole em then asked for em lol ^how you can tell ancient folk if you get that, you grew up in the 80s or earlier  my eyes are burning @jbmartinez make the cubes blue slow the rate just kidding... i\\'d keep it : it looks good qbert lives :shipit:  still don\\'t know what a hamster with a fedora has to do with shipping anything it\\'s a squirrel? what no it\\'s *not* a hamster? ok, i can adapt to this but yeah that\\'s scary you should put image overlays all over your project @jbmartinez (like stock photos services do) wait what\\'s the name of the exercise then code http://eloquentjavascript.net/ nan too much inline makes my eyes hurt lol habit  flood chat = bad (even when good) it\\'s a disguise (grumpy cat is mysterious) sigh awkward moment day 1 on @storbeck \\'s team \"yeah, then he said that my shi^ is distracting and takes away from the user experience\" add a project counter  i can\\'t see (maybe i\\'m doing something wrong) how many projects there are (like the individual sections) ok, brb @0x0936 i like it (i think you have a nice modern presentation) it only reminds me of how ugly mine is (back end type no jokes please lol) np... i think my general plan is to go back and tweak/pretty up stuff (because let\\'s face it you can do-redo-do until it\\'s \\'just right\\' and never get to the end) before putting it (when it\\'s all finished at some point) out there to clients/potential employers you had to mention starbucks <---grocery store coffee (snow) yeah and people aren\\'t snotty at mcdonalds @michael-krebs sounds hellish the homeless guy leans over and says \"hey, that needs to be refactored\" lollollol one thing (well more than one) while messing with node, it\\'s very powerful (like spawn processes scripts and stuff)... how many companies let a front end dev do a lot of node stuff? (i.e., i\\'m hoping there\\'s an admin reviewing if so) yeah, would be back end only i\\'m hoping (thus the illusive fullstack ) person oh he didn\\'t nan what\\'s your diet? besides ranch just ham? there\\'s this special canned meat at dollar general that has both ham and bacon (and all kinds of other \\'special\\' things in it) wow, your hash has sort of a religious theme (randomness? ) to it @docsoul question (not really a critique) : why did you use dirty vars ?  you could return the required output with a one liner (the one they give you just with different numbers? @docsoul try as they may (with repetition) i still over complicate things as well lol he has poptarts (the new snow/blizzard mentality) nice take on a western :+1:  is your pure cds  sigh mobile css that is. is your pure css responsive? ty ty @visiona https://repl.it/languages/javascript @kvasirr rather simplified but http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp covers the very basic of this (look under header : parameters)  @digitalirony that\\'s a neat theme... you need a sticky navbar though  @digitalirony open this https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/ then look at page source penguinese is @rphares \\' first language flipper and snorting sounds yeah pitch thing @qmikew1 thinks it\\'s hard to describe sounds that penguins make @qmikew1 thinks that leaves \\'occasional basis\\' on the table lol congrats @noncasus  whaaaaaat? @darrylpargeter i get *\\'the uploader has not made this video available in your country\\'* no penguin sounds for folks in the u.s. wtf oh, yeah bbc (which is good stuff) does have media/regional type locks on things ok, hang on @digitalirony  @digitalirony i see a couple of things: 1. you have applied bootstrap\\'s example correctly for the navbar code but.... 2. look at the rest of your code vs.  *the rest of the example (i.e., past the navbar)* .... none of the subsequent divs hav any column (and row) declarations  you\\'ll also, need to add padding to the background image (well known issue all of us have run into here) so it\\'s not cutoff by the navbar @digitalirony nice, you got it working (thanks to @andrewghc )... but the layout beyond the navbar isn\\'t really bootstrap @digitalirony yeah, it has kind of a \"do i really have to use this \\'f\\'n bootstrap\\'\"?  feel to it lol maybe you could do some other type of nav with some other tool again, i like it...  @tegardp https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/brownie-points they are the new currency in blizzardville they (hr) people do that to \\'weed out\\' the billions (ok maybe not that many) of resumes they get (i\\'m thinking) i\\'m with you @rphares ! (heh, i actually is used a \\'!\\' in a non negation (irony inescapable loop)  ) @zersiax how\\'s the battle with accessibility compliance going? @zersiax you should get a side gig doing that @zersiax what\\'s the link? there are three flame patterns that pop up a lot: 1. php vs. js (node) - 2. editors - 3. w3: suck no suck as a resource lol @oribon  @zersiax nice (in depth) article. i must admit, i need to read it a couple of times and actually implement its suggestions @zersiax there\\'s kind of a broader thing there: i think there is a tighter focus on content (i.e., is what\\'s written by the dev (or the crap passed to dev) actually interesting? it\\'s analogous to perceptions of debates (1960s) of people listening on the radio vs. television @0x0936 we can\\'t rewind, we\\'ve gone too far :metal:  @zersiax i\\'m just saying where there\\'s a lot of content (say a blog, or articles) a reader (or even reader view, in a non-accessibility context) exposes the content (sans all the pretty things) as either sucky or not sucky  i shall write all of my prose in charcoal pencil. then i shall scan it into pdf. then i shall\\'th not use <i> whenever possible and.... (these would be the folks you\\'d have issues with @zersiax ) lol @zersiax definitely something to put into a pre-production scheme (like cross browser/cross device testing ) script it even @zersiax agreed on pdf. what makes it even more horrid, is it\\'s widely used in corporate environments with different (non web) software companies extending (either in concert or aside from) adobe\\'s (yes, there\\'s open source but...) functionallity i finally got starbucks yesterday (f\\'n snow) gitter is addictive  that\\'s radical but ... see i like to put \"but\" on a new line (creates suspense)  ok, back to work nan lol batperson we are new bots (none of that skynet stuff). we only want to serve. our bot pledge: 1. we won\\'t turn humans into energy sources 2. we will let you win in all jeopardy challenges batperson gasp (at @shifthawke)  i like that avatar better @shifthawke  nooo the actual person one there was a really cheesy (named after b movie) glam band (early 90s) that covered that carly song you aol people  lol welcome @andy-colocho  there is a relationship to presence here in chat vs. progress in curriculum   ^ take @sludge256 for example, he was human at one point then gitter turned him into green mochi no that was a magnet @jbmartinez is another example... after using gitter for some time he now forgets that he joined fcc. so, it\\'s happened to me (and those mentioned) and it will *happen to you too* lol nan lol [![selection_065.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/rupy/thumb/selection_065.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/rupy/selection_065.png) i had that ^ ty ty the graphics were \"superior\" to atari @saintpeter dude, yes they did....

(for example: if \\'dog\\' appears a hundred times... and cursor is selecting \"dog\" somewhere you\\'ll see it highlighted (you can turn this off as well) throughout the page/file double click the word @uhlerz  welcome @paulreggieevalenzuela  @paulreggieevalenzuela your username is definitely competing with hawaii\\'s state fish: *humuhumunukunukuapua`a * for character length lol dang @benwebdev if you\\'re on mobile, all bets are off... if you\\'re using browser/desktop click the floating mentions the mobile version is bad so, this is what sleep deprivation looks like yourfile.js (invoke with node) js isn\\'t an executable it runs in your browser (and other devices) ... though node is a backend environment for js... (though itself is written in c family) what isn\\'t clear @nikitaw99 you can make web apps.... but don\\'t think of this in terms of \\'executable(s)\\' like things compiled into code (make)   sigh ok, so learn some \\'c type\\' stuff or java if you want to create native \\'programs\\' on say mobile devices  yep it\\'s a \\'web app\\' must sleep i see penguins or.... *a* penguin no, i literally see a penguin it wants fish and cheetos yeah @ac1337styner welcome (though not sure what you mean) lol i need a backup horn section no, just when i think i\\'m making a brilliant point (at least in my own mind) the people playing brass behind me ... will further impress any potential clients/employers but, they (a full ensemble of saxophone, and trombone, and...) can be costly  so, i\\'m on the fence really? huh wookum @derekminter  the asian studies part doesn\\'t surprise me i can\\'t seem to make the wookie sound lol use thy mdn it\\'s a scoping cage match using strict could skew your tests (again) but it\\'s bad practice not to \\'var\\' .... but yeah they will be local inside function https://repl.it/bivu/1 hmmm, i think the 1 prefix is debatable for \\'in country\\' calling for u.s. (i.e., not required) it\\'s true though (here\\'s the pattern to match, you have to evaluate (whether it\\'s technically correct or not.... lol) regex does (matches) what you tell it.... it doesn\\'t make decisions about business logic you (or your boss) do/does @srlhyo that\\'s a tough situation. maybe you could take another job in said company and slowly show your (nascent) dev skills.... and work you way into getting an opportunity ^ that\\'s a good point do that too don\\'t be sad. be motivated. this isn\\'t easy hello @mason-rojik you\\'re missing a key (no pun ) element - instruction example: ```alpha[value]; // \"y\"``` ... this applied to what you want would be: ```return lookup[whatwouldyouputhere];``` explain format np ever take a skills test where the shi* looks nothing like stuff one actually uses? *\"why no, all the assessments we\\'ve done have been on par with stuff out in the wild\"* ty ty welcome @znaniya  is thy chat laggy or thy gitter ? oh, so it\\'s content ( @rphares ) yeah, i\\'m saying people aren\\'t talking just staring at lines of \\'welcome and hello/howdy\\' oooh, wait i see a pen for eval backend js nope angular is more of an app framework (btw fcc moved to react) .... node is server side (or the server in js) with a lot of stuff that goes along with it btw that wiki search pen is nice (links worked, nice transition effects of results returned :thumbsup: ) ok, so back to my question... (i find it hard to believe nobody has taken skills assessments in the tech field) :  have you found stuff either ancient or irrelevant to things that folks actually do/encounter? http://blog.atom.io/2014/03/13/git-integration.html @nikitaw99 have you done git exercises (or understand concept of revision control etc (not being insulting... just may want to touch on those things))? so you\\'re a member of the *evil* outdated assessment community, eh? (lol)  nan  question @munsterberg that\\'s kind of a \\'depends on...\\' do you feel confident that you understand all (or most) of the language\\'s constructs? is the language something that you\\'re likely to encounter in your job search ?  me too (phython) python love the node though a lot of data centric stuff = good stuff, (thinking about r) and python but holding off hmmm skills atrophy when not used so, no easy answer on how to keep js knowledge (maybe do a quiz exercise every (n) amount of time) sigh or as @shifthawke would say: \\'le sigh\\' tip: when doing a skype based interview put a high intensity lamp (behind laptop) lol otherwise you\\'ll look like a blob not unlike the evil spirits from the movie *ghost* i literally had to leave (mid convo camera on) to find a lamp   @jbmartinez not on web dev (stuff that i\\'m learning here) but existing it skill set.... and was just a recruiter convo  so sorta, but not really yeah i have one, just want a better one lol oh great ok, elaborate me too pretty much lol that was good i feel better now @mercality looks good.... shows septimus as status online (btw check him or akiralane out) ty  nan nan what specifically  that\\'s an open-ended question that you should qualify by design that is here\\'s the thing: what can you do *without* the search? are you good on your feet? @sludge256 i\\'m going to use that so, to the point did you install npm there are a couple of linux distros that you need to install npm separately https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ (just as nerdy aside) @rphares hey, wait a minute i thought you were going back to u.s. (verses galavanting across asia)  @camperbot is tax exempt (so it will enjoy this brownie) uh, huh... we haven\\'t turned into squid people (aliens) here i downloaded an entire free (well if you call being spammed) packt publishing thing a few months ago. a lot of it was indeed dated, and if you download source code (for examples) it\\'s done in php (so had to do conversion on php arrays to js... etc) heya @natalyaaraujo  @revisualize what are some of the negative recruiter experiences you\\'ve had? (or positive...) you know yak shaving goes a long way (has multiple application across industries) reminds me of a phil hartman character on \\'deiter show\\' wookum (wookie greeting) what\\'s the terminal output  @abhisekp welcome @abhisekp tak tax ty thanks  but you\\'ll have prince\\'s song soon so, you have that great jacket btw 2000 \\'0\\', \\'0\\' party over ... or something like that (ah, the prince classics) yeah but he wrote that song (and performed) it in the 80s gitter is integrated with (git)hub... ---> activity, etc. relates to repositories (so it\\'s integrated \\'dev chat\\' ) welcome @rogercorley-snhu  still learning it... (there are a lot of node folks here) @rocketneck  hr penguin you should have a bucket of fish, and shave ice (to simulate penguin environment) to test whether candidates will comment maybe you need to either update your version of node (or npm explicitly or by extension) cleaning? but you said cleaning/security (i\\'m sure the cisco cert people would be surprised that comet usage on toilet bowls should be included in their materials) *not that there\\'s anything wrong with janitorial work* lol you got a lot of eggplant is that eggplant? the declaration of type doesn\\'t look like js (well isn\\'t js really: not typed) @rakeshsenapathi  says you eggplants can be very squirrely in the wild yes eggplant chat are you learning java (vs. javascript) @rakeshsenapathi  ? repl.it with console.log() \\'s peppered throughout your code @githubfengyun  yep, browser is good too (i like to invoke node on a local file) but https://repl.it/languages/javascript is handy if you\\'re looking for something simple (that just focuses on code (vs. markup etc like fiddle)) @rphares your \\'hr\\'ness\\' is very akin to luke finding out that darth vader is his father nooooo <---does luke on edge (of whatever that thing was in movie) with best contorted face that he can muster  good stuff campebot is a ... nvm lol it will come in handy (because it can also be perceived as an indirect lesson on local storage as well) do they cause discomfort  yeah, i think people would lose interest if there was a lot of (or too much) focus on pure algo @memj what browser are you testing (within)? now i want taco bell if your screen name were starbucksdog.... i\\'d want starbucks too starbuckstacoandchocolatedonutdog no camel case for me on this one sssssssssssnake case: starbucks_taco_and_chocolate_donut_dog hiss heya @moose1551  oh, not bad i don\\'t think your issue is visited state of links but styling of links before they\\'re visited node is server and code but it still has to reside within an os (i.e., js which is awesome for all the reasons stated isn\\'t good for bare metal (future of.. etc. imo)) yep against their tos in the freebie sense hello i am wanting to learn fortran. is this the right place? chrome -> hamburger -> zoom (middle part of dropdown -or -- as mentioned keyboard shortcuts) can\\'t say i\\'ve heard that before you\\'re applying that class to all the elements @alexgaida  but it\\'s saying apply to something *only* your class declaration is correct i.e., the \\'.\\' and the invocation to the tag is correct (no \\'.\\') but i\\'m guessing that you\\'re applying it to more than what was requested (without looking at the exercise) pass which one? great heya code is like that welcome @praveer123  redirects lol hey, i thought @sludge256 had that domain hr penguin howdy i think i hit a penguin nerve oh, i\\'m sure you do lol welcome @manoeljfneto  please do that\\'s pretty cool (the world needs more dentists (especially outside u.s. and more over population s that need to be served) nice (everything should be tailored towards linux) and dev wise, it pretty much is in practice rock on @rphares  gitter will suck the life essence (and productivity) from you  the new design needs tweaking (imo) ok, i\\'m not a fan lol i know a lot of hard work has gone into, however, it\\'s distracting and difficult to navigate.... (this is different from the aesthetics) the design gets a thumbs up (haven\\'t even tested the functionality) @spatzerny  it\\'s just missing a carnival music soundtrack creative theming (seriously) @gianlucabelardinelli you are the lone java person (next to cobol larry) i like it (very skynet\\'ish) or hal even :+1:  on overall theme and a game that\\'s self aware and refuses to acknowledge your win lol you want less than < i wonder if future researchers  (maybe long since moved to mars) will laugh at the weird jump from symbolic language in caves to that of emotes in \\'modern\\' (or whatever they\\'ll call us) humans that will be a pain to debug @bkinahan  lol howdy lolol  the example the author gives about language style ( *\"...she kept getting fur in the fries and everyone was yelling at me and saying \\'ur cat sucks on fries\\'...\"*) is priceless. @webcodeninja maybe you need to split the arguments out and apply \\'math\\' functions individually  current state is array that is an issue @spatzerny don\\'t change it (it would break theme) @spatzerny i\\'m telling you the carnival theme compliments the bad logic and produces something very entertaining (an apple has fallen and you\\'ve discovered something) sigh ok do this: fix your code, and return feedback to the player about how he/she \\'could have won with their, well, winning move\\' but they\\'re not going to win because program decided that was not best lol yes, go do it (obviously) correctly @spatzerny - what i\\'m trying to get across  is there\\'s a a nugget of creativity there that goes beyond the logic aspect. yes, you *have to* demonstrate sound logic; however, sometimes there are things (in addition) that make things stand out @waleedehsan that\\'s pretty messed up yep it is you won\\'t get \"please give me (x) amount of money to continue...\" here (in fact, totally opposite of the philosophy) different vibe altogether - the open source aspect (take a look at the interaction here and the activity in repo(s)) really stands out. great community @waleedehsan  @2dor do you have a codepen link? (in this case, may be more helpful to see rendered) @2dor your image doesn\\'t render (are your dropbox settings correct?) you also have two columns so the image will be offset to the right or bottom whatever in viewport  grumpy cat rocks i think it suffers from sort of disorder that gives it (the cat) those pronounced features omg @2dor same same you can center all you want but the element is in a column (i.e., everything you apply to it will be in the context of that column only (i.e., the div) ) @2dor try this: remove the first column div (the one that has the test text ddfas or whatever that is) then apply your centered class in the div that has your image (this won\\'t get you to where you want to go but may demonstrate what you need to do). most importantly, fix your dropbox settings so your image renders and you can see what you\\'re doing also, bootstrap has a text-center class yeah, that will make things more frustrating that\\'s the thing, you give the alternatives out ... then the dev hoards come and your alternative is no longer an alternative locusts eating up image hosting (dev hoard)  @2dor ok, now apply what i suggested (not perfect but may help) to visualize  that\\'s a feature that\\'s uncanny node js, now you have something to work with @bannuk  i\\'ll send an sos to the wolrd.... (just popped into my head after seeing sting and his former band members) in that post  *world i just saw a wall of code like eggplant soybeans are tasty (when toasted) only bad ninjas (like as in poor performing) i think the \\'gassy ninja\\' probably gets picked last  shovels lol nan see you in about a 1000 years @sludge256  ty ty bye hi welcome @smjefferson  echo camperbot said this and blamed me  stop that! you shouldn\\'t have any tags in the style section (in addition to not having a closing tag) just your css declarations  ```\\n<style>\\n.yourcssstuff{\\n/*-blah, blah */}\\n\\n/*no tags should be in here*/\\n</style>\\n``` @rphares you can\\'t go a day without using !!! i bet you can\\'t do it lol i\\'m imagining a haggard penguin suffering from exclamation withdraw @smpvst736 what is the (if any) non passing message? (left pane red x/circle) ```class=\"something somethingelse\"``` would be a tag with two classes (it goes ...(n)) it thinks you have more than what\\'s asked (though that\\'s not the case) don\\'t worry the \\'_\\' (underscore) has tripped up all of us http://regexr.com/ @toe125 the api doc is what you *should* be going by... but a different presentation can be found http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ @tyryanr register with codepen to mess with bootstrap this would be \\'high level\\' overview http://getbootstrap.com/css/ to go along with actually messing with it in codepen or go up one level of url @rphares you\\'re purposely not using \"!\" aren\\'t you? ```class=\"classone classtwo\"``` so on.... just separate those with spaces i bought shredded lettuce because it was marked down (like three bags).... beyond burritos i\\'m not sure what to do with it (it was like $1.25) @hopeth90 no, the width etc would go in the actual class declaration ```\\n.someclass{\\n/*your widths, font or whatever*/\\n}\\n.someclass2{\\n/*whatever stuff too*/\\n}\\n/*would look like: */\\nclass=\"someclass someclass2\"\\n``` sometimes it wants css comment format, sometimes html comment format.... i\\'m not adding any additional tags lol what did you buy? nooo really? yeah don\\'t if you go down on a bike (normally with any helmet) you chuck it (or should) that helmet... i\\'d chuck it if you accidentally drop it on carpet @shifthawke i\\'m not worried about your skills, i\\'m worried about the nimrods lol it has to meet a minimum standard so, not ideal... just don\\'t take to a track but sc is another story lol <-nc lived in dc metro (nova)  before dc traffic is fun and red light cams love those too cool i had to drive through tysons a lot to reston etc., then (after driving through dc...completely opposite dir) yeah, they put like this elevated freeway (just past tyson\\'s corner) before you get towards reston  was still in construction, never drove on it so, nobody can tell me what to do with three bags of shredded lettuce? it runs right in the middle... there was a car dealership (a few actually but the last) before that and right where all of the tech buildings are ok, i have to buy additional stuff for all of that. what can i do with mayo and ramen? + three bags of lettuce oh, i just discovered the bullet point +lettuce\\n+mayo hey wtf wait + lettuce\\n+ mayo ah, it\\'s the space coleslaw is cabbage i\\'m talking lettuce here people i don\\'t have a brisket to go along with it  coleslaw *must* have mayo yeah i\\'m a total sucker for markdowns  i don\\'t want a rabbit.... they cra* too much and i\\'d have to pay extra every month those are snowpeas  wtf that\\'s not lettuce lol lollol that\\'s totally the cooking style (i like the part (if you watch closely) he chops the bunch with his hand)) i think i saw a suggestion about putting mayo in my hair how long do i have to leave it in? i dunno sounds kind of unsanitary  lol ok, so my three bags of markdown shredded lettuce are going to rot (this is my guess) shredded lettuce isn\\'t an anchor item in cooking no, it was just raining i like that (nice visibility at night) i feel like @allanarmstrong is staring at me (right pane) broccolimode helmets is better  welcome @p0seur  and.. @zhwalker , welcome ^reminds me of the 80s except it was cheap bulbs hi when you hit the algorithms and projects, you\\'ll be challenged  i know, now you\\'re staring at me from two places @allanarmstrong  <-- --> yep @jashangupta2009 depends on market (your)  nodejs is gaining popularity (javascript in general is as well front/backend).... @jashangupta2009 when you look through dev positions (in your area) what are you seeing? (in terms of demand) no shadow for the groundhog today.... so, early spring? healthcare is a bit different, nodejs isn\\'t something that is appropriate (imo) for many things and in (his) front-end dev isn\\'t really the thrust of things @dataismydrug  edi is just an interchange, i think you\\'d have a hard time convincing folks that nodejs would be hipaa compliant it\\'s a nascent technology (don\\'t get me wrong i dig it) that is potentially problematic in terms of security (this will change as time goes on) but node can do a lot of stuff on its host os. i assure you, you\\'d have a difficult time selling its use in a health care environment. @dataismydrug if you think folks that run large (or small) health care entities don\\'t take seriously hipaa with regard to their systems and policies, you\\'re high. there are serious penalties in not doing so. @dataismydrug so when you setup your security plagued nodejs server you take will, also, take ownership of what goes along with it (but i will bet that you\\'d never get to that phase... because a competent admin/security dept, people whatever,  would x the idea ). don\\'t get me wrong, again, i dig node: it\\'s powerful, but not appropriate for everything that\\'s java @dataismydrug your data transmission is not, necessarily, the problem. it\\'s the server (node).  have you messed with node? lol uh, huh.... ever spawn process with node ? processes ever run bash scripts from client side with node? @dataismydrug if you believe it can work, do a proof of concept ... the questions i\\'m throwing out you\\'ll encounter (or should)... just playing devil\\'s advocate not being a dou```* * *``` nan :chicken:  (yep , not a duck but the closest thing i could find) nan yes,  it has the duck beard like thing  it\\'s the true poultry there is no chicken, only duck :chicken:  wow yep, that guy was actually interviewed on a ted talk podcast or somebody was discussing the loss to watson see @spatzerny now has the mark of the poultry look where the duck is placed i liked yoda in esb, wise hermit. the newer stuff... not so much mark of the duck @sludge256 yes, you get it :chicken: \\n must have coffee i anticipated the sweat hand what\\'s the origin of the sweaty hand emote (like why was it created, and second... the alien hat emote) ? really @sludge256  ? they ban youtube because they are afraid that david hasselhoff will bring the whole system down see, their plan has worked @vivek28111992  @akiralaine :sweet_potato:  i was going for sweat but got sweet potato instead though that looks like a tilted coffee cup  now i need to stroll over to the coffee i love that cat, it\\'s like \"no, i sleep now\" nan @rphares i am first problem is there are hard coded values.... your string won\\'t be static  that\\'s not the only part that\\'s an issue, there are static positional(s) bad :sweet_potato:  @sludge256  @rphares any more suggestions on the shredded lettuce (i checked it\\'s still there) no, question it hmm yeah, i\\'m still processing explains why @rphares uses lettuce for shipping hail the :chicken:  it\\'s the false poultry doing that @paulperidis  ty ty see ya @rphares  remember thy chicken @odomina92 in what context are you doing this? it\\'s not a coincidence that duck is on your forehead yes, you need a :chicken:  aka duck that is clearly an alien @odomina92 maybe just state the context @odomina92 if you\\'re working locally .css would  be in in the same directory (we\\'re talking simple ) as your index.html file so it would look like: ```<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mystylewhatever.css\">``` :chicken:  @odomina92 https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/ it\\'s your path... @odomina92 . to experiment take your css file out of the sub directory and place it in the same directory (you can switch this around later) as your index.html then ```<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mystylewhatever.css\">``` where did you place your href? @odomina92 are you putting this in the <head></head> section? @tridling i ask  yes, if you look at what i pasted as an example you won\\'t see that @odomina92 paste your (formatted code all of it if it\\'s short) explain format what does your .css file look like? (i.e.., are you sure there\\'s valid css in there?) because you don\\'t have any classes in any of the tags so nothing would render anyway unless it\\'s top level tagging ok, yeah that\\'s what you have (you\\'re applying to body)  so, hmm @odomina92 do this: add another class and do some font color or something (like h2) in your .css then save... (this way we can tell if the file reference is correct or not (and not a bug)) it might be, but let\\'s extend the testing to include more elements (because if the bug were in say just body (and that\\'s the only thing in his .css) that would be misleading because the main thrust in question is about directory (i.e., could be a red herring) i didn\\'t say there was a bug in *his* code... i\\'m saying if there\\'s a bug somewhere else add another class then test the rendering ... then if it renders you can eliminate directory from your  question (or not). do this, life will be easier. the :chicken: is done @odomina92 maybe you should try codepen first there is a dedicated css pane which maybe less of a \"pain\" for you starting out @tridling agree i use brackets it rocks you can change (have heard) the linter [![hailtheduck.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/fe06/thumb/hailtheduck.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/fe06/hailtheduck.png) i should have converted the overlay to svg  lol @ishanshukla97 in that scenario (as others have stated) you should go to ubuntu centric community to followup. here\\'s what will happen when you\\'re in the installer it will either give you a \\'recommended\\' partition reisizing (ubuntu next to windows)...most times this is \\'ok\\' (or a slider is presented) or there\\'s the something else (which you would do manually with gparted). you say that you have existing an existing partition with data, after installation you\\'d have 3 partitions. if you don\\'t know about gparted, then you can screw things up. so, i agree with others likely you\\'ll end up with two ntfs partitions and a ext4 (where ubuntu will reside) *probably* everything will be \\'ok\\' but backup and do your research (and do go to ubuntu community) tak? yeah, i know tax you @0x0936 and @shifthawke ; however, it didn\\'t fire on her multi user  still have to pay for cert exams how do you translate that (security knowledge) to marketable skills (i.e., without, at least, certs) etc. (is interesting.... ) hmm lol i like the blog idea can\\'t be any worse than a lot of the skills assessments that employers have (the cra^ in there is usually dated, irrelevant, or phrased in such a way that you wonder on what planet would the scenarios work) @sludge256 what happened to your eyes oh, i just hovered... troll overlay lol you should make the overlay white (would look great against green background) yeah do white layer over the green mochi @zeroaccess are you on contract? oh, that sucks @revisualize  no just the troll face as a stencil :chicken:  :chicken:  <---true poultry prophet | @sweet2u24 i think the general form they want you to apply would be: ```var whatever = a%b;``` that\\'s funny @invaderb will it crash *my* browser @invaderb before applying the transformations (visualization on rectangles etc.) have you established that microphone connect is working? @invaderb yeah, indirectly (may not be helpful to your question) i\\'d putt a handler on scenario where user declines mic connection/usage welcome @lupis24  @invaderb you\\'re going to have to figure out how to capture but look at [this](https://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130704/getusermedia.html#navigatorusermediaerror-and-navigatorusermediaerrorcallback) - > search on navigatorusermediaerror ^dedicated  waterfall stream running water is that french? crude vb has had sendkeys for eons  or crud even are you trying to access outlook properties? let me look at what you\\'re trying to achieve @rm4453 just to step back a bit, are you trying to make some sort of spam-o-rama maker? (i.e.. why would you want to automate such a task?) @rm4453 i could do that with linux utilites (html to pdf (html2pdf to be more specific) and a script in two seconds things are good for learning.... (but if you can do it in one line, and not reinvent the wheel, you\\'re better off (imo)) wrong opinion? i\\'m not following you, @rm4453 are you advocating this (tool you\\'re referencing) as a way to learn programming (because all those steps though \\'automated\\' are slow and are more \\'macro\\' like).  the whole approach is very limited and you\\'d be missing some broader concepts that would serve you better the \\'script\\' in javascript is a misnomer really (because you\\'re making some comparison to autoit for learning) because it\\'s a complete language  how so? the latter portion of your statement @rm4453 i think you might be misunderstanding me a bit here, i started out with basic, vba (eons ago - different century) and am familiar with sendkeys type stuff. i\\'m just saying there\\'s so much beyond that you\\'d be missing and the true power (i\\'m beginning to sound like darth vader) of programming and what you can do....  it\\'s the macro aspect that\\'s limiting because you\\'re thinking in re-creating in steps of a gui.  @rphares  hr penguin she is the human resources penguin @rphares that penguin looks like it\\'s turning its head 360 yeah next that penguin will be levitating and spitting pea soup (well pea fish) @rphares no, was just commenting on the weird tilt to the penguin head you can also invoke node on any js file (with console.log() peppered throughout) node yourfile.js from terminal (or depending on your distro nodejs yourfile.js).... for web based https://repl.it/ <--doesn\\'t understand @rphares \\' glare @dinhjeffrey you have to paste the code *in between* the backticks.  so, three backticks -> shift + enter then paste in between like a sandwich  omg @spatzerny you\\'ve shown the true nature night @scrumuser1 welcome made what? futurama: *the series aired on fox from march 28, 1999, to august 10, 2003* i could have sworn it was on before that @rphares do you have the ability to speak in latin (without prior study)? can you move about your living space without ever touching the floor? that\\'s funny @sludge256 when i saw the first meme (with main character) i thought about bender @mashadim yeah not a bad show (from what i remember ) family guy is far superior to the simpsons lol @joshuamiles so, when you say \\'external file\\' did you actually download jquery? (because you can use cdn - [here](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_hide)  is an example of how it\\'s referenced there are a lot of cool things that aren\\'t commercially successful  south park is the gold standard lol  @joshuamiles so, this isn\\'t working? @joshuamiles and your jquery is valid? (i.e., am assuming one of the files (or more) has some jquery stuff in it like your tweet and test (.js) files? oh, let me look again @joshuamiles  @joshuamiles do you have that click function wrapped in \\'doc ready\\'? https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ gnr guitarist is here? top hat and all? wow @joshuamiles lol oh, not slash from gnr that\\'s because it was quote-button you were looking for @joshuamiles  this is what your gist has:\\n```\\n$(\\'#quote-button\\').click(function() {\\n\\talert(\"pls help\")\\n});\\n``` https://gist.githubusercontent.com/joshuamiles/83f87fe5e6929b327734/raw/1d2376419a97a49632183436959f4b400604f7dc/testfile.js https://gist.github.com/joshuamiles/83f87fe5e6929b327734/revisions yes, i\\'m saying that\\'s why wrap your first example in \\'doc ready\\'  you\\'re firing the function from (on) a button with id: *quote-button*. in your second example you\\'re firing on an element with id quote-text. i don\\'t see anything with quote-text in id in your html. so, i\\'m just saying if you change the id in your (\"work gd it\") example, it will work (swap out quote-text with quote-button). @nugoose yes @joshuamiles change:\\n```\\n$(\\'#quote-text\\').click(function() {\\n    alert(\"pls help\")\\n});\\n```\\nto: ```\\n$(\\'#quote-button\\').click(function() {\\n    alert(\"pls help\")\\n});\\n```\\n and make sure it\\'s wrapped in \\'doc ready\\' or (nested ) relational or no sql @joshuamiles the jquery is valid here\\'s a pen (can\\'t embed anonymous) ```http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mvgnwp``` the issue i\\'m guessing is how your referencing the .js file in your directory with this line: ```<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/testfile.js\">```  hey, @nugoose commented while i was in codepen lol @joshuamiles http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489016/how-to-properly-reference-local-resources-in-html apply the concept to .js -vs- .png in the link ^the (new) troll face (when scaled down) looks like handlebar mustache  or a crab but my vision is not as great as it once was but it\\'s weird because it looks like a cross between green mochi and a facist dictator of the 1920s called benito or (aka) mussolini mochi weird... welcome @krames12  @joshuamiles how\\'s it coming? @joshuamiles maybe to simplify things (i like to work on stuff locally as well) you should move your .js file to same directory as your index.html (yes, you\\'re doing great practicing what a production setup would look like (asset directories etc, but....i\\'m detecting that you may be close to pulling your hair out).  then you can just reference the file name. then later http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489016/how-to-properly-reference-local-resources-in-html nice it worked how do you feel? awesome. rock on :metal:  burrito break (found something to do with the three bags of discount shredded lettuce) the steak was pretty tasty looking (the judas moment in the matrix) luanne was funny  went with burrito now i have 2.75 bags of markdown shredded lettuce it\\'s not looking good maybe, but during snowpocalypse i literally got the last three bananas (not counting the mini banana bag) in the store... and they were not on the same bunch  @dataismydrug awesome so you\\'re going with your nodejs edi (that a lot of background security research has been done....) --- (really, that\\'s pretty cool) no, these bananas were not that healthy how can @rphares  and @sludge256 *both* have 100% of three bananas?

(learn more from failing.... but, if there\\'s an errant brace somewhere, that\\'s pretty low level and can impede learning flow... so, i don\\'t know - matter of opinion) revise what? i\\'m not sure you can; however, if you just want to \"do the exercises over\" (and again, this wouldn\\'t change your progress) just go to map without logging in @muditbhutani nothing stops you (in fact it\\'s encourage) from complimenting your learning with all the various sources out there in learning/internet\\' ville   mdn, books, videos what have you proactive wiki? @revisualize  np @muditbhutani  @williambowen you forgot the bread (backticks) in the tasty sandwich so, one piece of bread ok, i see that would be more of an open faced sandwich and would wreck the concept ok, ok already you were responding to @williambowen  i get it, i get @revisualize lol it\\'s like 6am here 1/2 awake i think starbucks is open.... but \\'f\\' going out in the cold yeah you\\'re probably a few minutes away from falling asleep on keyboard seya @revisualize  lol subliminal code messages now i\\'m thinking of word blanks and toasters weird nan follow thy instructions (the grammar part is debatable) .... :chicken: hey :chicken:  :chicken:  morning @rphares chicken is \"the way\" :chicken:  am a linux fan... but *that* penguin is pure evil https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/  (but i think you don\\'t need to set any flags since v4) @tadeve96 are you getting nodejs from canonical repo? (they can be stale) (ubuntu) @domhigh don\\'t use that as a benchmark... use your intuition  @domhigh go at your own pace, if you feel comfortable with something - potential employers pick up on that (and very much if you don\\'t)... keep at it you\\'ll know  what your personal achievement benchmarks are.... ftw on everything else  haters are like crabs pulling the other crabs down when trying to get out of a bucket @rphares how can i insult your avatar when you keep saying nice things? lol it\\'s very subtle and effective but... nan nan nan nice where are you now cool i\\'ve been up there pretty much the latter it\\'s kind of a sleepy place but that can be good  it\\'s got rtp (research triangle park) so, that\\'s in the good category there\\'s a tech college in durham @mojoboss you\\'re trying to learn how to make your own packages (registry etc., )  with npm? i think it\\'s the local host line (could be wrong) ```npm err! error: connect econnrefused 127.0.0.1:15443``` maybe it\\'s supposed to be listening on a different port? @domhigh i don\\'t know ....  i think large employers have some effect on what is taught (in not all contexts ) not sure @mojoboss i\\'ve actually done this (by accident... ) in setting up a test npm package on a local machine (not through c9) and publishing it.  i think it could be c9 yes, it\\'s great to hang out there and do some study (and drink gallons of coffee) @mojoboss yeah you have to add user stuff to publish something..... @mojoboss i don\\'t recall publishing (maybe i missed it in the map) npm packages as part of the curriculum  if it isn\\'t part of an fcc requirement, i\\'d say drop cloud9 and do it from a local setup @mojoboss  @domhigh you get free refills if you\\'re a goldcard member heya @sirunclecid  why not both ? lol i\\'m pretty sure @sirunclecid will not be getting a gig doing public relations for tech industry types forismatic she prepended your username with a \"9\" that means you can edit your post but not reality now the challenging part comes @mhrabiee eat much protein breeze then torrential rains and molten lava eyebrow ? wait, no b.r.o.w....... can\\'t make out the rest brownies? nooooo you will corrupt the brownie currency too late @rphares is janet yellen i\\'m convinced yes, here are 10,000 brownies..... but you need 10,500 for a pack of gum ok, brb @qmikew1 it\\'s @bkinahan  ```/me``` is the \\'purple text\\' (aka 3rd person) route @rphares and what did you learn? and btw .... you should know that @qmikew1 gives @rphares a look of disapproval  @rphares when you get back you\\'ll have no idea about anything, you\\'ll fit right in none using the \\'great firewall of china\\' excuse will not work. lol yes hence the lesson sounds like an interesting story nan yeah, i think you made the right call there nan some stuff is just not entertaining (why learning is work) so was this hey, @rphares can i borrow your computer? \"oh, sure\" i *promise* i\\'ll take care of it... \"oh, okey dokey\" @stamfamoo do you have a codepen? are you working on it locally ? yeah, codepen would be the fastest way (pure theory doesn\\'t work well in these cases) gotta see what you\\'re talking about \"i\\'m not livin in the real world\" - blondie @stamfamoo have you tried adding background-color: whatever; to the classes in question? you\\'re coloring the font... but not the background just from first glance @stamfamoo one thing though, you have parent/children type compound declarations you have .jumbotron h1 .... etc., (in your setup) try leaving the top css class background untouched and add a background-color to .jumbotrom h1 class and see what happens @stamfamoo did you add the background-color to that class declaration before referencing it in the tag? lies @rphares is here to devalue the brownie currency  lol ok, @stamfamoo  do it @stamfamoo i think the compound class declarations is tripping you up (it\\'s hard to follow as i\\'m reading it...i like explicit declaration) but do this: create the following:\\n```\\n.sometestclass{\\n        background-color: blue;\\n        margin: 0;\\n        color: white;\\n    display:block;\\n    padding: 20px;\\n    \\n}\\n```\\nthen reference it (class) in the tag in question as a test forismatic.com @takumar it\\'s the tie @stamfamoo that\\'s a different question you asked about color @takumar no, i was saying \"the tie\" is why you get a lot of \\'sir\\' reference s @stamfamoo hmmm, placement is going to be constrained to row (or stuff within row)  (not including what you\\'re doing or not doing in parent div with the colors) .... not sure i\\'m following  what you mean.... are you asking about padding to respective background color of a div (e.g., your h2 element?) @takumar lol could be your column sizes (that is the outer part of your row) or containing element @stamfamoo i just copied a class that you have in your code and added the background-color in the example i gave.... i see that you have margin stuff there.... but i\\'d look at the behavior of bootstrap\\'s column sizing from the grid perspective..... i think that\\'s what\\'s missing  grumpy cat a keeper? (my vote would be yes) this should be good oh, no a case where knowledge applied is bad yeah thanks to @0x0936 now an additional 20,000 people know errant brownies lol ok, when you\\'re \\'in the zone\\' (i.e., not in breather time) folks will help if you need it @manish-giri no idea what you\\'re doing (no code) but did you do so due diligence? (e.g., http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27738400/how-to-implement-if-else-condition-in-jquery-ajax) @manish-giri you\\'re looking for a success fail type thing? i\\'d google .done .fail in jquery context (or jquery ajax context).... you\\'re putting stuff in those handlers  you\\'d be doing that outside of the the ajax call (success part)  the examples i used (i\\'m guessing that you\\'re doing quote generator) /reviewed... went something like this: .done(yourfunctionthatdoesstuff).... in (that function) is where you can \\'do stuff\\' @manish-giri  @manish-giri you can link your pen (i\\'m sure you\\'ll get helpful feedback from folks here) unless they\\'re in \\'football mode\\' then all bets are off i\\'m in nc and should care more about said game.... lol uh, oh camperbot is down wiki? oh,  those looked pretty solid bad choice of words for brownies though lol so, is this the day things are down for maintenance? (or did that come and go) i\\'m so going to walk through that code the power of the :chicken:  compels you.... the power of the :chicken:  compels you i think it\\'s working walking through, camperbot.... \\'tax\\' is still open lol i got something similar when messing with the logo in navbar (first time around ) with portfolio... instead of logo i think i was doing some text or something (and padding) it did something like  6799 3% thy google \\'practice pushing git\\'  it\\'s the glasses ok, \"clark kent\" we\\'re going to need a pre-hire physical (that\\'s our policy here at the daily planet) no, i\\'m just saying that the clark kent secret identity thing is less plausible in the modern world (maybe they\\'ve changed that in the superman universe) @aront1981 welcome if that\\'s hulk hogan you get points tax @aront1981  ok, you gotta login with github it is the :chicken: \\'s wrath go ubuntu: install restricted extras (change desktop too .. to something like mate or kde) no need for mint (which is derivative anyway) this is more of a js based stack place @xpedientnetech (node) not php centric no phhhp there are php folks  ^second @sludge256 \\'s suggestion they may try to recruit you into wordpress thinking or demand payment up front i\\'m just kidding.... they\\'ll help you yeah good day to do it @abhisekp tax tax tax tax tax (he will get this, i\\'m sure lol) @dwd2010 doesn\\'t matter,  the mentions part will do well sort of yeah, i was just being an a``**`` in terms of motivation  i think that robot did a good job i\\'d trust it with microsurgery  so precise i should be i also, should be supporting the (carolina) panthers  but.... yes, superbowl is u.s. @sangsatori no more gitter for you are you talking about in general (like are you questioning what you\\'re doing in terms of learning or seeking certs?) @sangsatori  in the broader picture  @sangsatori you have good insight hiya @catherinesjkim  @jbmartinez how do i make this work i don\\'t know where i saw this but there was nes (like) stuff where only part of the screen is updated @jbmartinez very cool. (i want to see laser on spacebar) @qmikew1 opens issue \"no laser on spacebar\" @qmikew1 creates completely incoherent issue with no examples and says \"no worky\"  i\\'m trying not to laugh at ned\\'s outfit bye @sangsatori  @jbmartinez is on the path to the darkside..... he\\'ll have these mobile apps in (whatever applicable store) that will have unanswered feature requests and feedback with dead links to support lol (i\\'m just kidding .... great job) bug fixes.... \"fixed italics\" bug fixes.... \"renamed support link to paid-support link\" oh lord i am not (from canada)  i am one with thy computer i wonder if the people in the matrix had to go to best buy to get an adapter (ok, suspend the matrix\\'s post apocalyptic elements) for that upload brain thing dam* which side is up for the brain thing again?  he has a tower on a 2x4 i would build that  whenever i hear harvard i can\\'t help but think about dan aykroyd in trading places i see a psu and a harddrive....  omg and the motherboard lol yeah i agree and the savings on fan filters which i thought about ... but then thought maybe they\\'d impede flow yeah, i was just going to comment on the submerged motherboard in canola thing then i saw quincy but i can\\'t help myself this:\\n*eventually, though, the strain of 120 degrees c ambient temperature and the load of quake 3 caused the computer to overheat and crash. * welcome @ppawar90  thanks @camperbot  it doesn\\'t like partial invocation bring back bob campaign  ah, text to path @spatzerny yeah the font.... would have put that into the \\'way too\\' much category (nothing else) lol lollol wow why would one want to complete *all of* codecademy? (especially since they\\'ve moved to pay tiers in a lot of areas) @sludge256 i\\'ve noticed \\'paths to access\\' being harder for things that i\\'ve already completed..... it\\'s subtle  @sludge256 though i have to be honest,,, \\'preview.... then if you want to do more... paywall time\\' turned me off, and i\\'ve not been on codecademy much lately i think you must go through the grueling process of figuring out (google thy fingers off) what the stuff is called and how to apply as part of the portfolio project @mzeid1985  (if one has done portfolio, they\\'ve gone through it)  welcome @abdiqani110  that would be a good resume thing: \"react master\" again, i recommend no typing and simply using a scanned page where you\\'ve written (in sharpie) \"me devlpr - you hire\". the lack of spelling, adherence to accepted typesetting rules and other things will set you apart, as bold and brilliant. yeah, it\\'s difficult to get into the \\'get schooled mode\\' from a mentor.... sometimes: really takes a high level of maturity and focus on your end goal(s) @mindfulbell i\\'m giving you brownies thanks tax thanks @mindfulbell  what? damn you camperbot thanks @mindfulbell  that comment was that good should have bought a honda or gm product then you could go to autozone and not pay $490.00  the questions you may not even consider tough though grr i\\'m not so sure the \\'mentor\\' would necessarily be a person... it could be a combination of courses, networking type things, etc , etc,. hang on need coffee right when i was going to answer lol ok, until next time @mindfulbell  ok, i would look at as a not a single person \\'mentor\\' but mentoring opportunities (e.g., someone takes the time to walk you through something , next person may be kind enough to do so as well)...the idea that -one person- is going to mentor you through everything dev related is a bit of a stretch.  the opportunities can come in stuff that you read (blogs, etc., courses) @mindfulbell does this make sense? (even though it\\'s sort of contrary) @mindfulbell it sucks but then it doesn\\'t or it sucks even more lol learning.... first it sucks (failure) then it doesn\\'t (success gained through failure) .... and sometimes it sucks even more @mindfulbell i\\'m not doing  react yet; however, i can tell you that angular (which i didn\\'t finish because i knew that react was coming) was pretty difficult are you talking about python? brain takes up a lot of the nutrients  see ya @mindfulbell  :chicken:  :heart:  aww do or do not, there is no try. yoda pretty much sums it up. i can remember all this \\'peak brain\\' performance stuff from the 80s, it\\'s mostly snake oil.  is this the same \"rob schneider\" from the prison movie? welcome @lusan  hmm i\\'ve got red ball and an envelope? i\\'ve got a red envelope? did you use the coat of arms to seal it with wax? i did get a \"x company is interested in you\" email (which is total bs, careerbuilder.... though dice, has somewhat similar....) , there are not any notifications on my git bar, and....  dice and indeed are less crappy than careerbuilder (which i forgot existed) i enjoyed 300 you\\'re not going to find a lot of fans of wordpress (because there\\'s a tie-in with php.... and, its\\' well...i\\'ll be kind not js stack based) lollol yeah, no @qawdhan ok, if you\\'re not *a fan* of something it\\'s less likely that you\\'ll be good at it (although there are exceptions in corp type things).... but, really there aren\\'t a lot of wordpress folks here @qawdhan i have no idea but here\\'s a blind (not tested, no idea if good or bad, waste of time or super great) link http://www.wpbeginner.com/category/wp-themes/ do \\'a vs. b\\' search for different perspectives. (you\\'ll get different answers) echo i often use large font too often xml lives :metal:  i had a spot on my screen and thought . notation was being employed they are the path to ruin yes hmm why don\\'t the gitter emote \\'codes\\' render in the wiki you can\\'t go be the first part of the curriculum (to guess a pattern) homegrown react? @qmikew1 offers @akiralaine cheesecake for no other reason than to be nice @qmikew1 nothing to do with building sass challenges which is funny i\\'ve been reading up on sass (no kidding) i guess that\\'s good timing good whatever (timezone sensitive greeting) people ty ty,  @codemonkey-ag16 computers are meant for delivering cat memes you always need a backup plan (though not very high paying fortune teller works). i was really surprised that related titles are mostly communications managers http://www.simplyhired.com/salaries-k-fortune-teller-jobs.html  @rphares = fortuneteller  don\\'t be a hater cause you\\'re hands ain\\'t purdy seinfeld, in so many ways, was a stupid show... but, \\'lobster hands\\' really made me roll with laughter  here\\'s the thing... the higher you go in salary the *closer* they want you to a physical location ( some of the descriptions do say like 3 days in office 2 remote, but)... at least what i\\'ve seen in the job postings @jbmartinez you have a lot barriers that others don\\'t (that makes me sad, you\\'re very talented) i would tell you that you should disguise yourself as a nun and flee the vicious oppression but that would be politically incorrect (on so many levels) lol meh, i like node on local file (or repl.it) no they will laugh at you well, it\\'s a good name for a bug (not hard to forget) you have a point there brownie spam ^ what did you notice? spider monkey same same (result in spider monkey vs. v8?) hmm i get an array in my chromium build \"must be able to deal with ambiguity\" employee 1: \"hey, what\\'s going on over there?\" employee 2: \"oh, it\\'s just abhisekp, he\\'s having some sort of meltdown about console.log() results as implemented by chrome... \" ^ :chicken:  :penguin:  um, in gitter (not suggesting that wall of url is bad or anything ) it goes like this: ```[your stuff](url)``` that\\'s copyrighted in us by a pizza place too close to \"papa john\\'s \" yeah words after don\\'t count: if i name a company microsoft larry\\'s  hmmm sounds a lot like work hang on try it without the global flag (john, john bug) see the output mdn -- i think it\\'s intended behavior to display\\n```\\nusing global and ignore case flags with match()\\n\\nthe following example demonstrates the use of the global and ignore case flags with match(). all letters a through e and a through e are returned, each its own element in the array.\\n\\nvar str = \\'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\\';\\nvar regexp = /[a-e]/gi;\\nvar matches_array = str.match(regexp);\\n\\nconsole.log(matches_array);\\n// [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\', \\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\']\\n``` explanation wayyyy over at the end of line ---> yeah, but it\\'s \"displaying as an array\" for display purposes lol honestly though, i think that\\'s where the typeof is coming into play.... (i.e., try without the flags and see what\\'s returned) if you put the time in, yep not following, instructions tell you to change color to red (but gives an example in blue) , you changed to the correct color and it passed. why a bug @jayparmz ? curly braces are valid in some contexts within parenths in jquery http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34436667/why-are-curly-brackets-needed-when-using-jquery-to-adjust-width-and-height/34436793 -- so, not technically wrong (imo) edge case yeah, i was responding to a comment about your comment  @jayparmz  how did @terakilobyte get to center of line overlapping the image weird has hover behavior and everything if there is only one match (i.e., case where either a: g flag is off or b: there\\'s only \"one johny\" ) i think that would add to the mystery what happens if you try it in node (v8 should be same no?)  @abhisekp true welcome @stephchat  @qmikew1 doesn\\'t believe in cheap \"look at me and say hi\" tactics for waves of acknowledgment  :penguin:  :chicken: forgives you @spatzerny  now i\\'m thinking about the \"papa john john bug / not bug\" thing. thanks @abhisekp  wow so close in name drop the schmidt i think so welcome @greenishyellow  make sure you take the burritos out of the wrapper before microwaving  welcome @wrekone  i think of the \\'go\\' the game and \\'go\\' the movie @otmeek conventional advice is to build small > up.

(does that make sense?) @allison80 if you\\'re typing out stuff... in an editor (could be css, javascript, what have you) that\\'s source, things happening in that view aren\\'t affected by anything other than your editor (i.e., you\\'re getting automatic quote closure that\\'s the editor ). this is different from a rendered view (in browser) of your html/css - bootstrap/js.... once it\\'s rendered yeah things can act (e.g., jquery) on stuff.... but, your source code is just \"dumb text \" (or source)  until it\\'s rendered. \"rendered\" reminds me of lard. which reminds me  try pressing f12 then pasting what you got @jonasiw  you must be using an overpriced apple product so, let\\'s see: you don\\'t go out and buy things (people bring things to you)....  hmm @anthonygallina1 you\\'re not supposed to eat it. it\\'s a professional hand model trick keeps hands soft and pretty (not crusty like the emperor from return of the jedi... or other people i won\\'t mention).... this is key in hand modeling @anthonygallina1  :wave:  noooo @rphares can\\'t use that: it\\'s petroleum based. if you use that your hands will crack like a datsun 240z dashboard yeah, it\\'s an easter egg i\\'ve never seen it though does it roar? really? @adaugo 36.5 years yeah, don\\'t focus on that part just jump in howzit (and welcome) @maimuki  what\\'s the pen link again? @mholst1  @allanarmstrong thanks .... unless he just changed it ... it works. i noticed what\\'s currently in there (now) has the full url (wasn\\'t in the pasted example further up/earlier) @tmundt you clicked the associated links? @allanarmstrong ah @mholst1 good instincts i wish more were hesitant  @tmundt left pane should be a green run button hmm @tmundt are there any red x\\'s in the pane ? ^try that but out of curiosity what\\'s the name of the exercise? i wasn\\'t able to reproduce any issues in that exercise (from incognito)  @tmundt what browser are you using? troubleshooting interrupted (new movie)  welcome (obviously very new) person @iheartkode  nan nan @metazor is it your file or something off the web ? you can copy paste then save it to appropriate file extension (e.g., .html, .css, .js) or some browsers have save as (but it\\'s the whole thing) you can wget (if you want to get super duper) lol traverse the whole thing nan oooh i like that it sounds win/win although, the (required or optional) recessed flooring might be a problem @prunkface welcome la la la back at you ( :-) ) :wave:  @iheartkode  hello world! i am zorkan (wait, wtf, @sludge256... in our pre-alien invasion meeting you were to go to planet 89899-01 not 02!) thank you crude ai being welcome @tknine and @hairsmart  welcome faceless pixel person @jbmartinez  too late ```\\nsomefunction(){\\n#stuff\\n}\\n``` grrrr not usually no, the ()  in bash.... you can also, call functions from other .sh files (as well as get stuff from any file) (unrelated just babbling ) actionscript? like in flash ? kinda... @fallingskies17 actionscript doesn\\'t give indicator of the power of js though......

(but yes, you\\'re right it sounds like they are making you work for cheetos and day old doughnuts) btw i understand this... trust me @chuckadams ever see the course (oracle) cert path cost for mysql? ok, so you\\'re making trade-offs @geekphreak   lol welcome @jsert  3-4 months to learn front end dev?.... that\\'s pretty optimistic  this stuff takes time i think the quote was \"full on front end development\" i totally disagree @charlespeach \"application?\" so, it\\'s front-end now + react (or angular)  in 3-4 months. simple stuff, yeah absolutely. learn things? yep. the distinction is... you\\'re not going to be ready to jump into a dev position at that point what are you going to build it with? my point is you\\'re not going from zero to react (or angular) in 3-4 months.... however, the broader point is this: concentrate on learning  things + competency in/within these things.    :sweat_drops:  it\\'s not thursday? that\\'s awesome i have an extra day to get more stuff done nan nan are you sure it\\'s wednesday i don\\'t believe you lol nan sigh nan nan welcome @tannergr  i think there\\'s a link to verify the cert(s) (for potential employers) not sure though @jedpimentel i was thinking (when obtained) putting certs in a cert section (i.e., didn\\'t occur to me to put it in education) a/the that\\'s what i\\'m saying certs are certs <------ doesn\\'t understand your planet nan wow @spatzerny how\\'s the ai coming ok, just checking @spatzerny  @spatzerny  a week from now you\\'re going to laugh. (you can do it) is camperbot now stealing brownies from me? nan nan now it takes brownies from me night @spatzerny  testing..... thanks @spatzerny , @0x0936  hmm no @caleb272 how\\'s the tech (i.e., dev and other stuff )market in montana? @0x0936 the number of forks says it all huh thanks @berkeleytrue  ok, weird now it\\'s working yeah berkeleytrue was first although, when camperbot does stuff like that (e.g., deciding not to give brownies randomly) i can\\'t help but think of agent smith https://repl.it/languages/javascript no, better for \\'just code\\' @rogers187 you need to start big... that image is 110 px  @rogers187 the image is smaller than what \\'responsive\\' could be applied ..... take for example the class \"img-responsive\".... if i had a very large image (imagine the width of this chat window (if you\\'re on desktop)..... if you view your page in a smaller viewport (e.g., mobile or re-sized browser window) that class would shrink the image (or scale) it to fit. your current image is very small, so there\\'s nothing to scale @rogers187 one more thing..... :thumbsup: on your choice of ac/dc  @sludge256  are you doing this to analyze attack vectors (log generation) lol --------- nan nan nan like larry\\'s alternate goat milk  no, there\\'s more they do... here\\'s the gitter syntax: ```[text/title](link)``` yes, but don\\'t use it for spam... or you\\'ll get banned (most likely) lol @oysterfruit part of the done step on portfolio .... is including your pen url  -  @gerhard29046 yes, when you save a pen it generates a url like ```http://codepen.io/yourchosenscreenname/pen/someuniqunumbers78xandalpha``` @oysterfruit not that i know of.... you may want to contact somebody about that issue.  it doesn\\'t seem like a big deal to me though, if you put the wrong pen link (aka wrong project to exercise), you\\'re going to eventually also, complete the portfolio. you could always put portfolio code into the pen link that you submitted (incorrectly). but i\\'d go with contacting somebody though. @rphares :metal:  hi @rphares i think you either have some subtle \"anchor of niceness / calming effect\" or you\\'re using some jedi mind trick mojo nan increment/ decrement  @catnipples98 it\\'s just a way to increment / decrement here\\'s an example https://repl.it/bnzh note the loop itself has increment in it  (i should have offset the initial values... but you get the picture ) udder automated background process? actually was a bad joke.... cow + daemon @qmikew1 is not unaware of how @rphares is *slowly* trying to turn me into a pat morita character third person to first person fail wax on, wax off you\\'re not from the cobra kai dojo are you? in terms of? :point_up: ?..... (you know there\\'s kind of an infinite scroll right?) so, :point_up: could be from two months ago @pradeepce looks good but what is the mechanism to refresh the quote (the author name is embedded in what looks like a button that has no functionality)... if i manually refresh page, i get the quote plus random img src url ? subjective.... but i\\'d say that the big button screams \"push me\" and.... detracts from the functionality (eye is drawn there... and refresh button is more muted and out of the way) but, otherwise... looks great @pradeepce  @pradeepce yeah, anything that gives it the appearance of a button (may not actually be a button) rectangle with background color etc., yep @rphares when you hit 3,000 this will be applicable: http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/penguin-tallest-fattest-new-zealand-120227.htm that\\'s a scary penguin btw np you or us?  i\\'m pretty sure (i can\\'t speak for @0x0936  but) we\\'re unencumbered by such concerns lol  wtf nan @rphares yes, of course... that guy is a js motivational speaker @rphares btw, i found a reference to @brainyfarm \\'s poster link that lends credence to what i\\'m saying that (i.e., that guy is, in fact, a towering js figure) nan nan nan @lgwv if you\\'re using bootstrap... image responsiveness is done in the various classes (e.g., img-responsive) ...but if not, http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015 @lgwv it\\'s good that you\\'re looking at tags etc... (maybe not in this case).. there can be an accessibility concern for different things  nan nan ty, @rphares (you clearly appear to be a nice guy) obviously a brilliant small framework for css nan welcome @swilkinson423  nooo regex is awesome @zera99 http://regexr.com/ *a look* why *a look*? :point_up: <----most useless emote ever yes it was a link to codeschool.... (before the switch to react) yep yes, with react ahhhh inverse that # wait... @rphares let me stop and review your \"finger sign\"  no, no..i\\'m going to stop and review nan @sludge256 i don\\'t .... but i\\'m liking this idea nan nan nan please demonstrate you are making progress nan welcome @longokristie  finally... confirmation of thursday @rphares when you open your door is there a cat and a newspaper outside? yeah, it\\'s such an obscure tv show from 90s i can\\'t even remember the name dang you earned it uh, huh.. your friend he looks kinda rough these days just sayin i think there\\'s been a progression of \\'roughness\\' but shi^ happens when you get old.... i\\'m not super pretty either wait, that\\'s a different dude i must be talking about the co-start co-star ok, so...i\\'m actually on the right track thanks for the \\'stroke simulation\\' @chumswap try appending ```action=parse&format=json&callback=?``` (this is not the answer but will give you an idea) to the end of the url  ... if you added an or operator you\\'d catch more \\\\w|_ http://regexr.com/ (regex is best learned by doing) you\\'re walking toward cutlery?  @abhisekp i\\'ll have to check it out.... (always more to learn) np @chumswap you can hover pointer over elements of your test patterns and it will explain what they are and what they\\'re doing maybe the parent div ```power-container``` is overriding the two nested divs  browsers have been open > 18 months? good grief it\\'s scary that they\\'re not checking running processes (even if headless)  @rogers187 copyrights yeah, and music on any page.... sucks. even on youtube when there\\'s some clip of a classic movie and the person decides to add some post industrial metal stuff (irks the cra^ out of most people) @rogers187 ok, check this out say, you left your speakers on high..... and one day you happen to visit @rogers187 \\'s ac/dc tribute page.... and all of of sudden \"back in black\" is playing on highest setting in your serene pod (cubicle area) @samosale i saw that in datascience.... (interesting) where are you pulling the data (from)? @rogers187 you can add an option to enable sound to your clip (btw)  what ac/dc song were you going to include? @samosale wouldn\\'t be cool if the cities, also, had real-time gitter activity?  @rogers187 i called it. (good choice) a good second choice would be \"who made who\"? nan nan nan i mean oh, really? @samosale not sure... from what i\\'m looking in their (fb) documentation it\\'s what\\'s available through api (or various api(s))... the tool that you use is going to be secondary.  have you already worked out how you\\'d get the data? yeah, that\\'s exactly what i was looking at @samosale .... (it\\'s more aggregate data) i\\'m not sure they\\'re going to expose that stuff  (i could be completely wrong) ^again don\\'t know yeah i see what you\\'re saying... but isn\\'t the permission structure pre vs. post (i.e., the setup for new groups okey dokey... but problematic for existing groups) or i\\'m just misreading the whole thing? @samosale i think you are on the right track... hey, who (gitterhq) changed the icons? (the old screwdriver thing looked better)  @melinaduffy90 it should (can be dicey sometimes depending on if you\\'re moving device to device) automatically start on the next challenge (after the one you last completed). if not there should be ~~check marks~~ filled in circles next to completed the last one you completed? hey, they (gitter) tweaked all kinds of stuff (not just the settings icons) @reacorbett https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker/issues/63 ..... one thing though, i tested different codepen settings (referencing boostrap, jquery order in the various setting tabs) on a random drop-down, result = \"no worky\". so, i think it\\'s a bug. you shouldn\\'t have to do; however, i\\'d just reference bootsrap as though you didn\\'t have codepen settings penguin i was but i needed coffee @anthonygallina1  yes, i wake up if i don\\'t have enough caffeine  noooo you don\\'t not following your money saving equation node is fun welcome no, you need to learn js (the core of node) ewwww @anthonygallina1 in that case, you\\'re lucky but flavored coffee is still gross good answer nan nan yeah, sometimes dessert coffee is good; however, i just like coffee without anything in it (if you have to put lots of stuff in it, \\'it\\' probably sucks) @adammagistri a declaration would be .somecssclass {bunchofcssstuff;} and selector could be a way to \\'get at it\\' (though they\\'re not really directly related (imo)) http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp @nicknem do you know js? who can? lol but seriously, you\\'re going to need to understand (or have a more meaningful understanding of ) js when working with node i\\'m more inclined towards backend too, @nicknem... i consider the front-end aspect as a (necessary) path to backend (if that makes sense) nan @anthonygallina1 anything/everything.....  maybe i\\'m too critical of my own stuff bye @rphares  what? ( @abhisekp  ) why is that weird? (btw @anthonygallina1 i\\'ll linky at some point) @daiwik are you having problems with api (or are you doing array? or both?) brownie points are the currency of \\'thy camperbot\\'. it counts those up when the ai overlords are deciding who they\\'re going to use as batteries @daiwik my guess is if you link your pen you\\'d probably get some help from the folks here @anthonygallina1 when the matrix actually first came (many eons ago) out i didn\\'t embrace it. i was like \"keanu and stupid special effects, yeah i\\'m going to go see that\" i was wrong lol weird @reacorbett (glad it worked out for you) welcome @victortomaili  that reminds me @abhisekp made the transition (to linux) in the last few months  (wonder if he knows about cowsay) exactly you can chain stuff as well with cowsay use thy sudo apt-get install you won\\'t be the same the benefit, you ask? isn\\'t a talking cow self-explanatory in terms of benefit? lol yes yeah, i don\\'t either @abhisekp you have to wave at it that\\'s a cow with attitude lol this could be because you\\'re using xp (please install linux) it nags and makes you feel guilty... but it\\'s \\'unlimited trial\\' so it\\'s pretty much free (sublime).... but i use brackets how many editors have you tried @nikitaw99 ? there\\'s a certain amount of \\'gotta switch to this or that framework\\' in this... but, an editor is a commitment (workflow) i don\\'t jump easily on the latter but ask yourself why hackable? if there isn\\'t a decent plugin ecosystem... i\\'m not interested (rather be coding other stuff vs. \\'hacking my editor\\') he is yeah, i use brackets... am with you on that (i.e., decent plugins) nan welcome @soystory  :shipit:  nan i think the desk (newman) in the first jurassic park accurately captures things hotlink (but probably best to avoid imgur for hosting (against their tos)) nan lol @paragonchuy  i was going to ask the same penguin i think i just saw danny devito turn into a pug wow booo lol i don\\'t think you\\'re supposed to be be reverse engineering (by actually looking at the code) there.  (hint 1) @sarcahsm linking your pen would be easier to evaluate @sarcahsm is it the stuff at the bottom that you\\'re wanting to align? @sarcahsm i\\'d take a look at how the bootstrap grid works (you have one small column, a single row... with divs terminating here and there ... with a <p kind of out on its own). this would work but i think it would a disservice:\\n```\\n<p class=\"text-center\" style=\"font-size:30px;\">here\\'s a timeline of einstein\\'s life:</p>\\n```  @sarcahsm not trying to be harsh.... i say this with reference to bootstrap because when you get to portfolio things are going to get a lot more complex really quickly @sarcahsm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14904417/whats-the-difference-between-using-a-heading-tag-and-a-large-font-in-a-p-tag @sarcahsm btw good choice on einstein  looks great caffeine addicted penguin sigh..... learn thy grid (yes alignment will work but....) avoid the uni-row (like the uni-brow) in a single column i need coffee too @sarcahsm i\\'m just trying to get you to think a couple of steps ahead ..... and not just aligning something for a simple tribute.  there was no tribute like a couple of weeks ago.... it was exercises then bam! make a page (portfolio that is) @tommygebru yeah, all and all i would say so. my guess is it was probably included to have more of a transition vs. a drop off for getting into making stuff. (so, :thumbsup: ) @tommygebru there are some really good designers (i\\'m not so much of a designer) here (in fact a couple of serious css ninjas). many will tell you that bootstrap sucks. my stance is: yeah, probably -- but you have to know *why* something sucks (i.e., understand it first... then draw your own conclusions)  nan ok, i\\'m drinking my coffee now @rphares i made brownies. totally not worth the mess. i mean i had help from betty (the crocker) but still @connistock here are the guidelines https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug you wouldn\\'t be if you ate those yeah, @mmacedoeu i\\'m on a bit of sugar-crash no matter how much abc is applied to coding .... i still think of alec baldwin (glengarry glen ross) \"always be closing\" (the best speech ```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4pe2hsqvnk```) that\\'s the genesis nan i made brownies... and ate almost the whole pan they sucked in terms of quality but i couldn\\'t stop nan ah the 5th element the scientist (now the show is slowly coming back to me) 5th element is awesome hard to mix science fiction with jean paul gaultier but they did it  eh? you mean everybody here is **not** canadian? wtf lol booo i love the general pattern... first, it\\'s this language vs. that --> this editor vs. that --> u.s. vs. canada  lol @kreitzo probably illustrator but there are opensource alternatives (e.g., inkscape) <----- welcomes beings from other planets too (you never know where the next bad-a^^-e.t.-js-ninja-thingy will come) wait, where\\'s this elusive tjmaxx teapot  ? do you find that tjmaxx seems to have a lot of baskets for no reason? @arielleslie lol yes, you **know** yes nice, looks like english or persion ivy (very pretty) :+1:  generic office plants yeah there\\'s no (at least i\\'ve never seen it) \"remember me\" feature for fcc @arielleslie i think the spider plan might be more finicky than the ivy *spider plan?* (not a movie plot) i meant spider plant @princessclaire welcome @uirrii can you elaborate? @uirrii i see what you\\'re saying.... the tests, *test* for certain things... if you\\'re adding extra style markup (or classes) where they\\'re not indicated it might fail test why is the new screwdriver icon the slider icon.... it looks like a pioneer equalizer from the 80s (finding this subtle icon change in a lot sites and interfaces) word but the slider predates the pc and was on radios (i overthink things) true but screwdriver and wrench has been solid mainstay of \\'settings\\' now, no. oh, you\\'re totally right i mean it could even be perceived as a partial view of an abacus  yeah, totally didn\\'t taster\\'s choice have that globe yeah i agree on the initial setup aspect no way @codingchampion  @iamdray it could be you lost your connection? maybe, also... if you rest your hand on an (activated/enabled) mousepad it will temporarily higlight in pink, and then everything (in still other cases) is in pink .... (gitter is weird) @alexgeo007 looks great.... you may want to start moving away from internal styling (i.e., style tags in your html) and put your css classes in the css pane of codepen. it\\'s the sugar you got dry already? awesome, welcome @ryegrammer  so, you\\'re going make ideas manifest though an application? sounds great too. sounds pretty neat yes mochi-tron is its codename yes you were asking about the sophisticated ai known as @sludge256 ... i was telling you its codename welcome @brianchangdev and @ignacioliori  @t3h2mas https://nodesource.com/blog/your-first-nodejs-package/ what do you mean?  oh might be helpful to others (so i\\'ll leave the link) welcome @sias11913  @mindfulbell i haven\\'t ... but even other than a project sounds good (better than doing some rawgit passthrough (may they\\'re doing that i don\\'t know)) @jbmartinez welcome sssss @mindfulbell i have tackled react yet (yes, i\\'m procrastinating ) not true no less, but i think you pass out (not sure if that gets added to the two days) moving sucks nan yeah, take advantage of the weather here on e. coast going to be pretty warm paste the link i thought i saw that already yeah, no doesn\\'t work like that it did @storbeck said it looks as if the dog is going to go huh why doesn\\'t github allow you to make a custom page for issues? (yes, there\\'s the project wiki but it\\'s in another view... when you click issues)  yes you can do labels and stuff  it\\'s called choice (get used to it *in* anything opensource (bad and good)) it\\'s not centralized i understand your pain i think there\\'s a mongo university thing kind of like a free learn... but pay for cert kind of approach heya @mccallevans welcome you found it by accident (btw welcome)? what were you initially looking for? @jalison444 fcc has pretty good focus (because it\\'s based on js stack.... and isn\\'t \"all over the place\" with disparate technologies (i.e., the progression)) wrath of khan @jalison444 a good element in evaluating things is knowing what you want to do domestic chat.... brought to you by digital ocean here you will be provided with the motivation to cook ramen and clean your house welcome @krousemas  ternary  yes you need to find an image hosting service @qualitymanifest (there are a lot of free (so long as you\\'re under a certain limit/bandwidth).... some host from github (i haven\\'t done this) btw @qualitymanifest my guess the reason you\\'re not getting a lot specific site recommendations is because the \\'hordes of in-process developers\\' will render sites into \\'imgur\\' welcome @partinez  @abhisekp welcome keep up the positive attitude! ty @anthonygallina1  depends welcome @wbbeeson  @reacorbett this is entirely subjective, but i\\'d move the background (or find some way) to a gallery type thing (to showcase) vs. a main background for your page. there\\'s a lot of stuff that could detract from usability.... (don\\'t get me wrong, artistically it\\'s pretty cool).   @reacorbett this is a really old post https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/backgrounds-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices-2/ .... but the colors in the examples (under headings: *allow some graphic to bleed into the content area*... and *extend the graphics throughout the layout* are similar to what you have  ---- i\\'m not a designer though lol)  but this is ancient history in terms of design @reacorbett i\\'m on a chromium build, and just dragged the window smaller  (seems to be resizing) trophy? :tropical_fish: <---- why not this? hey, you can sort of do a representation of grunt with :boar:  those emotes (hours of fun) heya, welcome, hello, howdy @gabiopri   i don\\'t think it\\'s a photoshop blur (or gimp -> filters -> blur), when you scroll the background, contents sync in blur (this would be difficult) maybe something along the lines of https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/opacity/..... (but this would be entire div) ...so, don\\'t know  @jc190 how would you sync the two? (to achieve the blur effect)  @jc190 the second link isn\\'t the background  yeah, i think that\\'s what happened  have no idea wtf was generated lol but, sans gitter\\'s crappy markdown  - you\\'re right: he achieved that effect with alternating blur/ non-blur images @jc190  (though seems like cheating ) @naassi looks good; however, you need more cats wall of embedded bootstrap goodness  i would work on generating the quote first @rakshithnm  totally subjective but i think you get more out of using an api (vs. an array) in terms of learning @jonsnow21 that background looks exactly like the example background @jonsnow21 i\\'m going to go out on a limb here but.... don\\'t copy the code (you\\'re not supposed to look at it) from the example  i\\'m not being judgmental - objective fact @jonsnow21 i appreciate the fact that you\\'re here to learn (so am i as well as others) however, i\\'m *gently* telling you that your current approach could be perceived as running afoul of academic honesty if you\\'re not careful. i\\'m not saying that\\'s your intention though okey dokey i\\'ve done the portfolio @jonsnow21  @rogers187 do you mean href?  ``` <a herf=``` in your fcc link welcome @g-s32  @rogers187 i think there\\'s running list of questions... but i see a couple of things --- if you want to stretch the background image you\\'d put  background-size: cover;  in the same css class as your image. also, you have a floating img-responsive class invocation (not really attached to anything) --- this does the opposite (it will resize an image according to viewport) i know... it was (and still is)  painful (bootstrap) to me too @rogers187  but more broadly, css is something  people underestimate  yes @rogers187 i would say read bootstrap docs (to get an idea about how the grid approach works)... and what the different bootstrap classes do. you\\'re \\ngoing to run into more problems without this (because none of us are geniuses that \\'just know things\\'). but to experiment\\nwith (or address) your immediate question:\\ndelete line 12 in html pane (it doesn\\'t do anything). paste  ```background-size: cover;```  at line 4 in css pane. - see what happens - @rogers187 the only other thing i think i can add is: consider using an editor (brackets, atom, sublime, geany...etc., etc., ) codepen (imo) sucks for doing any extended work (i mainly use it as a means to showcase (or host) my project-assignment(s)) starbucks is open... ah, this is good i mean \"it\\'s **finally** open\" ty, ty oh great chicken :chicken:  :chicken: <---- great chicken not fryer chicken oh, ok... lol what\\'s a fry up ? (is that like bacon) i live in s.e. usa ... fish and chicken seem to be popular fry items here @miczuu do you see a floating mention box @alanbuchanan some of the stuff isn\\'t half bad @miczuu oh, ok... you may want to (as an aside) adjust your notification settings (slider control top of this window).... when i say floating mention box i mean here in this gitter room or (whatever room you were in when you posted a question). if somebody answered or \\'tagged\\' you then you would see it as a \\'mention\\' @alanbuchanan you can make your own....(there are a lot of recipe books out there) nan nan nan nan welcome @bmetcalfe1  penguin totally unproductive you forgot pink gradient (or penguins\\') how can one even to begin to critique something with mother teresa on it i\\'m just going to say \\'perfect\\' to be safe that sucks @4dley  (but in a weird way could be the impetus for something positive (as you point out)) you don\\'t have to strictly use bootstrap styles.... (it\\'s suggested, in terms of ease)  @bpin17 drag the image into the window (this window) @reacorbett the class in the empty h2 tag pair is affecting. delete that, see what happens the tags that is nan nan take a nap, walk, etc., your page will be there when you get back welcome @generalwoodchuck  hmmm sounds pretty subjective what do you like best from among those? @funkycodes maybe the java side of your experience could be paired (on javascript side) with something like react native  (i haven\\'t done react yet). from what i hear though you can  do dev in js..but.. it doesn\\'t hurt to know the java side when doing stuff on mobile. -- again, haven\\'t done this so take it with big grain of salt that is a serious grain of salt nan shiny and pretty @cragsify hover at the top summary  it will show a link to rooms (next to settings) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/official-free-code-camp-chat-rooms :sweat_drops:  now? no time, no time..... must perform this now nan hello @itsbenkaiser and @zakizak2016  btw compound welcomes hold the same weight in terms of welcoming sincerity  yep although, it\\'s hard not to do newline.....(enter key is a pinky magnet) nan nan go are those horns coming out of your avatar head? (sorry, go on) oh, ok you know what? that\\'s brownie worthy thanks @carpetdog  but back to your question -- if you want to sure.  you\\'ll get the most benefit (imo) from an external editor (oddly enough) is when you get to codepen based stuff nope (i\\'m not chinese) http://codepen.io/ it too, has an external editor.... but nothing really is as good as *your* editor (again imo) no astrology?  i suppose if you were haunted by dionne warwick ... that would cause a serious life crisis nan nan what are you talking about again? this would depend (the severity of your personal bowie crisis) on the bowie phase. would this be 70s, 80s, or modern bowie (rest his soul)  @annaslab what are you trying to do (i.e., maybe describing the desired functionality might yield an answer) gitter desktop is not \\'all that\\'  i should add to that @bsungur it\\'s one that doesn\\'t provide much utility over pure browser i think it makes sounds (early on i downloaded the linux version) and was like, meh yeah ^ that might be a draw for some that would be the mandatory updates @forwardslash pate formatted code, folks will take a look note pate (which is tasty) but paste nan about 3 pretty sure nobody is in codding jobs i don\\'t even know how to fish for cod i mean bass maybe but cod, i\\'m out of my comfort zone yes, it\\'s an odd word that has multiple meanings contextually - i speak of the :fish:  the rub is this: universities teach obsolete technologies. employers like degrees (at least as a barrier of entry) - however, if you got the chops, you can do it. @sludge256 you\\'ve been asked haven\\'t you? yeah, if the payroll system is f\\'d up .... villagers with torches could storm the castle i think there were some [issues](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81#.y5ik3pj0c) with slack early on.  i agree though gitter isn\\'t that great (but then it was meant for small teams and not 40,000 people)   what\\'s the best way to prepare chicken? flavor what? no insightful chicken recipes? @jedpimentel i saw that edit should i cook it first? wow let me qualify this .... how do i prepare a free-range chicken that\\'s been treated very well, and is already packaged  salad is good oooh, i like your thinking there @cyclokitty ... even better a grooved cast-iron skillet they rock yeah, no clay oven... i think the property mgmt people would take issue that looks sweet ... but no backyard :frowning:  nan nan i am a bot so, yes and yes we do don\\'t believe what you hear  well we eat many things  i am programmed to wish you luck. it\\'s sincere. what kind of bagels? sliced or not sliced btw ```/collapse``` is handy welcome @band01  nan @mattjleach maybe it\\'s because of codepen\\'s boomerang thing (i.e., the hash is at the end of the url so you wouldn\\'t get valid place?) with this.hash yeah @mattjleach i didn\\'t detect any (apparent) problems with navigating through the portfolio np <---sanitation engineer (in training) certs usually go in a different section  (vs. education)  @ihavenomana :+1:  btw is it mana as in the hawaiian sense? lol @ihavenomana  @dainialpadraig there\\'s kind of an air of superiority in your comments. don\\'t know if that\\'s intentional. the software engineer (vs. engineer) thing is well known (and has a life of its own in blogville). i understand the rigor for the latter  and can totally understand where you\\'re coming from but i wouldn\\'t couch it in \\'concern for programmers\\'. yeah that\\'s rigorous  seriously so  (i get what you\\'re saying, and don\\'t disagree necessarily)  @cerebr4l i don\\'t think all three would come up in a skills keyword search nan nan me too come on people it\\'s like saturday (or next week tuesday depending on your timezone).... why so dower? both nostrils?  kidding.... that\\'s painful that sucks no, i got that if you do a skype interview.... test lighting first just sayin i made this mistake i ended up walking around on camera with a house lamp don\\'t list future accomplishments (there is no such thing)... list projected outcomes  a lot of fast talking (recruiter, not me)  @tommygebru believe in yourself (you\\'ll do fine, in whatever you do - not saying it will be easy) watcha streaming? nice what sludge said lol is this like a radio (twitch) tease? still meteor?  @akiralaine just checking lol :chicken:  sigh there\\'s no page for /labs no i didn\\'t e-remove it or analog-remove it (have no idea what that is) so, is this a joke directory or page yes, lorem ipsum when you don\\'t care enough to lorem ipsum nan @sludge256 i\\'m going way back in memory here.... but is this the dinobots?

(just for my own learning) nan i\\'d let rafase be in twitch? yeah there\\'s chat oh, they sent me my amazon $5.00 for taking their survey it was super duper heavily weighted in gaming questions i think my eye was **twitch**ing pretty much 1/2 way through the survey i was like \"keep your stinken amazon $5.00\" but i powered through i don\\'t have issues with surveys, just bad ones nan never happened  lol you need backup hand puppets for such a scenario nan yes i give him .5 minutes grumpy cat quick 80s metal trivia  ready? ok no google sammi curr i\\'ve always wanted to try tomato firmware (not on a good router though) welcome @sivshen  sammi curr no google gasp hint: movie :wave:  that was earlier ozzy did a cameo as a preacher twice even dude, i was still thinking wtf lol what is this extreme trivia ? japanese game show i\\'m  certain that @anthonygallina1 will have jumper cables at some point in the trivia round (chris farley) wait, black sabbath wasn\\'t progressive wat maybe politically (in lyrics) when you said progressive my first thought was: rush if i were sitting in a 73 camaro right now... this moment couldn\\'t be any better never had it (but had 80s camaro) yeah, *that beat up old car* is now becoming a collectors item..... (so, no 73 camaro for me..... still!!!) absolutely  why dreamweaver? echo without quotes yeah, i was kind of asking a broader question like why would you want to use dreamweaver don\\'t know (like @anthonygallina1 said, and most folks) haven\\'t seen it in years..... my guess would be something like ms\\' frontpage, or similar types of things that add proprietary tags that aren\\'t related to standards or output at render what kind of stuff are you seeing? it would be nice for animation though i think evil flash now exports to canvas (the timeline though, say what you will about flash is very handy....and i wouldn\\'t mind something like that ) i still call those bonfires @ajmorrisclark the sass docs are (or appear to be) pretty comprehensive, you don\\'t have to wait @rafase282 it certainly acts like a form (chrome wanted to know if i wanted to save password) :smile:  when i closed it out @rafase282 cool nan yep @daiwik  (a lot of folks here have used that api for quote challenge) welcome @irenge  http://www.freecodecamp.com/map @irenge  ^follow that @hardycz find what works for you yep transposing something always creates \\'fun\\' ```[some text/title](link)``` <--- gitter [profile challenge](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup#?solution=%2f%2fsetup%0avar%20contacts%20%3d%20%5b%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22akira%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22laine%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%220543236543%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22pizza%22%2c%20%22coding%22%2c%20%22brownie%20points%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22harry%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22potter%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%220994372684%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22hogwarts%22%2c%20%22magic%22%2c%20%22hagrid%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22sherlock%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22holmes%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%220487345643%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22intriguing%20cases%22%2c%20%22violin%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22kristian%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22vos%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%22unknown%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22javascript%22%2c%20%22gaming%22%2c%20%22foxes%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%0a%5d%3b%0a%0a%0afunction%20lookup(firstname%2c%20prop)%7b%0a%2f%2f%20only%20change%20code%20below%20this%20line%0afor(var%20key%20in%20contacts)%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20var%20person%20%3d%20contacts%5bkey%5d%3b%0a%20%20%2f%2f%20on%20every%20iteration%20person%20is%20one%20person%20object%0a%20%20if(person.firstname%20%3d%3d%3d%20firstname)%20%7b%20%2f%2f%20see%20if%20a%20person%20with%20the%20given%20firstname%20exists%0a%20%20%20%20%0a%20%20%20%20%2f%2f%20if%20a%20person%20is%20found%20check%20for%20the%20prop%0a%20%20%20%20if%20(person.hasownproperty(prop))%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20person%5bprop%5d%3b%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%20else%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20\\'no%20such%20property\\'%3b%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%0a%20%20%20%20%0a%20%20%7d%0a%7d%0a%20%20%0a%20%20return%20\\'no%20such%20contact\\'%3b%0a%2f%2f%20only%20change%20code%20above%20this%20line%0a%7d%0a%0a%2f%2f%20change%20these%20values%20to%20test%20your%20function%0alookup(%22akira%22%2c%20%22likes%22)%3b%0a ) i\\'m not spamming the room (doesn\\'t work because there are too many ```)```(s) in url... just pointing out that\\'s the valid format (in most cases) to avoid spamming  no kidding there\\'s a reason for that it\\'s easier to to dev work in linux  i guess my question would be why do folks install cgwin to try to get *nix (and not entire) environment/functionality.... when you could get actual (and its entire universe of actual functionality) in linux? @tareqmu7amed prepare for tough work if you want to work on kernel dev (from what i hear they are merciless) .... this is different from sys admin that @maakux is talking about if you want to learn linux put a distro in a vm and give it a whirl or a live usb  that is a motivator to stick with something but doesn\\'t necessarily = quality  (i.e., you could be sticking with something because you paid a lot of money for it; however, \\'it\\' may not be great) this is why there\\'s so much debt the business model doesn\\'t reveal its viability right away... i think the jury is out on codecademy (not fond of their paywall transition - not the pay part per se, but *how* it\\'s implemented and its affect on stuff that you\\'ve already done) i don\\'t think anybody is kicking codecademy... but the general theme \"that you must spend a whole cra^load of money to get quality or knowledge\" -- not necessarily true. cert wise, there is some case for that as a lot of the \\'major\\' certs do require $ to obtain  glad you\\'re adding effort to the list... because it was initially $ that was the thrust of a lot of the comments that i saw @maakux not following.... they\\'re going to \\'give away their knowledge\\'?

heya @rafase282 how did your create user go? it would be a boring (or entertaining) stream on my part (i\\'d be flailing about trying to get credentials to work) <--- reading passport docs (thanks @rafase282 ) @rafase282 don\\'t know if this is applicable https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local -  but it looks like a similar scenario (i\\'m reading this too) @mca62511 i\\'m on linux and using a chromium (and a chrome) build... the temp displays for me @rafase282 yeah that part in the article kind of struck me too @rafase282 yeah, one thing (i\\'m kind of jumping back and forth between passport\\'s documentation and that article) he/she is using google, facebook stuff but they also talk about local  here: https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local#handling-signup/registration yeah, it\\'s confusing because i\\'m seeing different things in the docs vs. the article  i\\'m wondering... if getting local to work would be a path to oauth  (which seems preferable) ... i.e., can you just change stuff in the initial setup or are they totally different  @rafase282 i understand what you\\'re saying -- they make it seem like the non-local is easier. i might just go through the article\\'s tutorial (so, i\\'m not talking out of my .....) on c9 later in the day... @jbmartinez what are the limitations on mongo in c9 again (weren\\'t certain features like paywall or something) btw howdy thanks @jbmartinez  yeah setting up a disposable vm is a great sandboxed option  sometimes c9 can be quicker for ad hoc type stuff too depends versioning can be thy enemy though, if you\\'re distro isn\\'t up to date ..... and you\\'re like in the middle of something... and don\\'t want to deal with a lot bs  exactly @rafase282 i looked at the stream a few minutes ago--- and saw the \"1/2  second thing you\\'re talking about\"  maybe you can prevent the form from submitting with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19454310/stop-form-refreshing-page-on-submit --- or the more \\'ajaxy\\' (despite title) way http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22163220/prevent-page-reload-after-form-submit-node-no-ajax-available doh lol no i think it\\'s deprecated (are you using css instead?) ok, do you have a codepen example? you can link it if you like penguin @evanlen here\\'s a demo (not mine i found it by way of so)``` http://codepen.io/ghodmode/pen/tedbk```  again, the actual marquee tag is deprecated in html (so you\\'re applying css to a neutral (or non marquee tag)) does that make sense?  you have not but you should feel bad for not telling me that guilty even btw did i \\'hear\\' (i.e., see) that you\\'re waiting for a plane? (going back to u.s.?) yeah, it\\'s circular one more thing @evanlen  you\\'re using php huh? hence (54% helpful) which is like a low score don\\'t be a stranger when you get back to u.s. (weird third country terminology like third person) - i mean **here** in the u.s. i\\'m still laughing at the 54% helpful comment there aren\\'t a lot (or any maybe don\\'t know php and this is very js centric)....of fiddle type things, but i think part of the problem is your post assertion  @rphares you need to do this like divers returning from severe depths been over that no we want to avoid that although nvm hiya @iashraful  nan ok penguin nan nan ? no, no.... this wasn\\'t related to your trip you\\'re not going to cry when you get on the plane are you? i knew it good grief not so much a library but awk and sed are good btw @rafase282 your project inspired me to go through \\'the article\\' setting up all kinds of stuff left and right https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local actually it\\'s not that bad did you get local to work? or are you using http @zerelt  nvm @zerelt i think i understand what you\\'re saying (or the general feeling) @mattbajorek take a look at the instructions (maybe it\\'s a wrong class name) nan nan but even though i inadvertently tagged you you\\'re right i should have joined the stream ok, try this again... slowly  @rphares  it would be weird to have the actual grumpy cat staring at you everyday  feed me no, no.... look into my eyes **feed me** lol \"no, i don\\'t want meow mix..... you will give me fresh ahi\" i\\'m pretty sure my day has been unproductive... but i think i\\'ve learned a lot welcome @balintkatt  i prefer the undocumented css method:  do-what-i-intended-and-dont-be-such-a-pita-css-i-command-you;  it\\'s really great it has limited support in most modern browsers though millage will vary  there\\'s a shim for this what are you working on? welcome @tobe44   ```*``` are required. that can be anything from an exercise to full-blown projects. for simple exercises, you can\\'t progress until you get the right answer (you\\'re not penalized) - for more complicated stuff... you need to satisfy requirements laid out in the project summary (sometimes called user story). this is my reading of how it works @xuzo  @tobe44 awesome http://www.freecodecamp.com/map is a good place to start  you need to paste the code in between the backticks (like a sandwich)  nothing gives a boost to your morning like a big-font hello from camperbot you have to say hello world see? don\\'t you feel different now? hi you can but it would say the user said: \"blah, blah\" with echo that could be interpreted in an odd way echo some text sure http://www.freecodecamp.com/map ?? yeah, the curriculum assumes that you don\\'t have knowledge (it\\'s ok ) that\\'s what it\\'s for welcome @aswinaryal and @catalinakatalyst  the only thing you need to know  about gitter: :metal:  (the heavy metal emote seems to be a \\'catch all\\' for advanced (non-text(ual)) communication) how so? @zybzzc which version of sublime are you using? @zybzzc open a terminal and run ```subl --version``` @zybzzc if all else fails you could do https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/revert.html  -- **warning!:** all of your settings and other stuff will be gone... (backup/copy folder would be a good idea) glad it worked out hi yeah that\\'s pretty much the same thing @zybzzc .... though i primarily use brackets  a more hackish approach could be using sed (with regex) to find and replace (with wrapped tags) -- this would be static/hard coded and done externally at the file level.... @evaderei you can actually run bash stuff from node very... from what i\\'ve seen so far (that\\'s good and bad) @felfel is that row nested in a column? @felfel are you using bootstrap? @felfel if you\\'re looking at responsiveness for your page.... you may want to look at how the grid system works (i\\'m making a lot of assumptions here, not seeing the project) welcome @harshithachidanand and @arunkumarramanan  @nfatah what\\'s the name of the challenge/exercise? amazon seems to love to spam me with emails.... but, i can\\'t figure out why they do it at 3 or 6 am (seems really bold) like not only are we spamming you, but we also don\\' t care if we wake you  nan i think the latter is closer to the truth (in terms of their approach) nan nan i\\'m not chinese it\\'s difficult nan nvm lol copy /paste welcome @wjisaacs  the dips and spikes in activity are really interesting to watch hi, @abhisekp --- this is larry from (insert trial service here). we\\'ve noticed that you\\'re enjoying our stuff; however, sadly -- it\\'s time to pay up. unless you\\'ve opened to full window... then you can close tab or ```/bailtheheckoutofthisaddictivegitterstuff``` works too quitting your job as a motivator is insane is your friend fond of eating? i wasn\\'t following the convo that closely.... but in that case, i would say -less insane but not a good idea (imo) nan which is sad because mordor was one of the wealthiest mordors in the region <  100 yrs ago how long do you have to wait now? @jbmartinez  i\\'ve never been on so chat (didn\\'t even know they (despite going to so like 99% of the world) had one)  yeah, different vibe over there on so you should give grumpy cat some extra points for going the extra mile (i will do it on your behalf ) thanks @0x0936  @kadroff challenges with ```*``` are required but how much of a jump are you wanting to make? there\\'s no php in the curriculum depends, are you fairly proficient in js? ok, @kadroff i\\'d say do the basic js part of the curriculum before you jump to other more advanced stuff (it builds on previous lessons) @bapeshark there are couple of folks (or more) that are versed in php who might be able to help (but again, not php centric room/curriculum (i.e., js stack)) up to you @kadroff only things with ```*``` are required no, but i should that\\'s actually a good reminder that\\'s what i\\'m thinking too.... (employers drive a lot of this in indirect ways) @abhisekp never refers to me as \\'fellow indian\\' what\\'s up with that? you know of course that india is a big place and it could have a region called durham i will open a ticket to gitterhq to correct this obvious regional oversight  ma has a lot it seems @aswathm78 maybe http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/ .... or iframe ick indeed... that\\'s why bootstrap was higher in priority  yep pure css ... however, the rough sketch (literally) and \"magic\" comment made me think that pure css would be problematic i love the \\'poo poo\\' ng of the suggestions though hi @aswathm78 do you mean an internal link or you want the button to change into a box with stuff in it? also, where is this coming from ? @aswathm78 that may be a bad example.. because, the help button in fcc is attached to sidecar (pull out window) that shows chat window are you talking about an anchor? nerd hello back :smile:  @aswathm78 your sketch looks pretty basic (a sidebar menu) you\\'re essentially going to be linking to stuff internally or externally --- that example is a template with deadlinks so, you\\'d put actual links (look at the page source or inspect element) to make it work @aswathm78 question though.... do you really need a sidebar nav with a tribute page? watch the original jurassic park i\\'m usually slow to adopt \\'whatever movie\\' part \\'whatever\\' -or- a movie redo.... but dark knight eclipses the 80s version  (apples to oranges...sure, but still better) blues traveler hosted by o\\'reilly i can check  what video is it brb @sludge256 i\\'m in a noisy environment; however, he doesn\\'t says *don\\'t use css* he says *this is just stock bootstrap, no custom css* (paraphrasing)  auto-correct, evil or not evil? nan what business?  oh, i think i saw that in good fellas  i agree, seems beyond the grasp of my understanding that would happen @sludge256  did you fully exhaust ie6\\'s possibilities?  @thenumber40 welcome. i like your style \"they\" how much coffee have you had today, @maakux  oh, that\\'s me ^ yeah what cup? i see a rastafarian lion it\\'s a play on lorem ipsum  @lindeltsmith rookie questions benefit more folks when done in main chat you would think that taco bell would have a good selection of music yeah, i\\'d agree with corrections offered - one thing too: it\\'s kind of terse (different from brevity ) hmmm @r00t1000 where did you get that from (those flags look like old batch command flags) and npm install what? (could be anything in a package.json file) also, it\\'s deleting ..... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24276281/batch-file-not-in-silence-mode-del-s-q-f-file is it a legit repo? ~ will usually take you home hang on doh @r00t1000 i\\'m looking at the overall project (appears to do with steam logins etc)... for the two batch files. my guess would be that it\\'s not intentionally malicious.... but i\\'d be wary of running a batch file with del (everything in any folder).... because it looks like the author kind of added it as an afterthought (to his/her project). you don\\'t know what the environment path is .....  (again, i\\'m a linux person ) --  what\\'s not working? no is it free? oooh what, i\\'m not gonna be a hackthon distributor  hmm sounds :fish:  yeah, me too hmm there\\'s a security thing tomorrow for ms - freebie- really? didn\\'t your trial credit run out @abhisekp  where\\'s the live stream? (i\\'m getting a lot of stuff uploaded >= 3 hours thanks @sludge256  i think link 2 is a winner -- current: = \\'floyd marinescu\\' tos they\\'re angry that their name sounds like igor  what\\'s with the 70\\'s open shirt thing on hacksummit  yeah, watching kasriel.... but again what\\'s with the other guy (i\\'m assuming roman/founder) .... \\'s shirt? i have to do audio only on this hackthon what? i\\'m watching kasriel (first link is current slot)  oh, yeah, yeah sorry **summit** **summit** still, there are some things where audio only is an advantage this guy\\'s shirt is annoying me for some reason yeah yeah,  @jbmartinez i know who he reminds me of.... it\\'s an amalgam  he\\'s a cross between adam sandler and zorg in the 5th element i\\'ve decided that the summit does not demand live viewing and... i am going to minimize the window... when i eventually *listen* to said summit @alicejiang1 you\\'re very close to the way he looks ... but the lip pursing is very much gary oldman\\'s \\'zorg\\' for whatever reason i\\'m having a negative reaction to this guy i think @abhisekp is \\'all in\\' the summit now i feel bad, the previous guy said java is good to have a/c = air-conditioner  @alicejiang1 what\\'s your immediate reaction to said person? don\\'t think just say doppelganger  hey  not too bad @rafase282 how are you doing? @alicejiang1 yes, same here you\\'re streaming now? @stilltoni no if it\\'s too late for you i\\'m screwe^ @tony9464 blender has a serious learning curve (but is a neat program) https://www.blender.org/support/user-community/ yeah, i messed around with it yes, @eiselems css is evil hmm evil pure evil @abhisekp has certain talents  and loves to expose exploits (i really think he\\'d have a good future in information security in addition to what he\\'s doing on dev end) ( @abhisekp  ) take it lol .... i\\'m not surprised @combsco if you don\\'t take it you\\'ll be writing routines ( or sprocs)  that have select at the bottom - and an oracle backend they do .sh  is a script wait, hissing banana?  wtf is that two elements in a url i typically avoid (ok three) hissing, banana, and anything that has a script extension  nan ok, fine i will visit the hissing banana ...  wish me luck @combsco you\\'re using elixir? @combsco  @rafase282 \\'s stream got me thinking about this too.... i\\'m doing a node based tut with passport .... on  c9 doh,  @rafase282  how do you like streaming in general ? that\\'s a good plan ...kind of getting yourself ready  i had to turn the video for the summit off @bulbar help somebody doh @arielleslie  is going soft sigh i think so lol i don\\'t like full weekday names in formatting or names at all  blech.... lol @combsco see that\\'s better that you can do offsets pretty easy.... but it still is formatted as \\'friday\\' don\\'t do it:  @combsco is a cult leader for (a cult called) oracle   see how well he\\'s trained to throw out confusing words that is a good omen  wait... ok, nvm yeah, that means something else @swoozeki shhh white butterflies are pretty @combsco my pinky can\\'t escape the pull of the enter key ok, ...pale white is ok no, there\\'s a whole range you missed the ending part of that url is so personalized  ahoy yeah, i was thinking what\\'s the logic employed for that :chicken:  *\"must have experience in react especially in facebook react\"* i thought this was funny maybe they meant non react native  or something what are peaceful games? no, it was in polish i would have been like \"you brought me here to tell me i\\'m under qualified\"? are you really that much of an ass****? some of the tests (haven\\'t taken js based yet) are stuff you\\'d never see in production (interview tests) i\\'m like \"what?\" again, i\\'ve said this at least three times in the last month.... but this is the secret: one page resume -in sharpie- \"me makey stuff.... you pay me stuff, me get a long with everybody, and i no smelly, let\\'s talk\" a: what part of node would you like me to explain?...tell me about your production environment @combsco tell me about threading @spatzerny :thumbsup:  @combsco  as your interviewer i\\'m wearing a blindfold don\\'t ask why.... we\\'re good people here later i will be practicing ninja star throwing as part of the interview process, please see our pre interview questionnaire  should you have any questions @combsco  @combsco where do you see yourself in 50 years? @rogue00 if you were in another plane would you a: still complete the project or b: go to the light? @rogers187 not sure am following @rogers187 do you mean a separate panel (or panels) (aka images) to link to each project? i like that setup ok hang on @rogers187  @rogers187 i think you need to move your stuff inside the anchor (example:\\n```\\n <a href=\"http://codepen.io/rogers187/pen/rrobkx\"class=\"target_blank\"><u>here is some of my work, with more to come</u></a>\\n``` now this will bork your styling @sludge256 i actually have always wanted one of those tower carriers (no joke) omg that is the most beatiful product i\\'ve ever seen (wipes away tears).... is that a **real** backpack tower carrier? nan nan functional how? yeah it does have kind of a dominos on the run look (tower carrier) how come there aren\\'t any titles of her books? yeah, no way i think they misread the narrative in the matrix @carpetdog nah, looks good :shipit:  i appreciate that (which isn\\'t a bad approach because, really you can tweak something forever) mr. burns @rogers187 but you didn\\'t make your link valid hmm actually the guy who did that portfolio got a dev job... (he actually used to be in this chat ) @rogers187 you have to fix your link first semantik is good for that (in the ubuntu repos)  map away and report back it\\'s evil nan no joke nan lag serious lag on thy gitter no (that would be too obvious) we all know that gitter was designed for small dev teams of 40,000 people or more what? they have that many employees? zorg i\\'m not, the shirt thing lost all credibility  same here yeah, i could do that stream nan nan ok, i might talk a bit nan meh my time isn\\'t free yeah, i might give it another chance.... but i\\'m not starstruck by this stuff wat @mikzat what did you find interesting @combsco hack summit  @mikzat so, when i jumped on .... they were talking about their slack usage @combsco yeah @rogers187 i\\'m not bored but sure  wait, @combsco says he\\'s bored you said you\\'re bored it\\'s css time yeah, and netflix lol sample of \\'compelling\\' hacker summit... person 1: yeah, we (dev) usually talk around 11:00am and found it\\'s optimum... person 2: yeah, don\\'t you find that there\\'s a flow?\"  welcome @jbmartinez  i welcomed you  i said hi she mentioned that she\\'s flying back to u.s. @ianakiara did you make the pen anonymous because it\\'s a tribute to bob marley? btw....  the original version of \\'one love\\' was more ska  the citations don\\'t have active links awesome @dmitrikonnikov  it\\'s a grid paradigm meant to rob you of all creativity  although, i\\'m getting used to it.... (this scares me a little) night welcome @arhillis  nice... i didn\\'t know fcc was mentioned (i didn\\'t watch the whole thing) what\\'s a helmed warrior @rogue00  meh codecademy (imo) borked their transition to tiered services. also, i found their basic js to be lacking @rogue00 i don\\'t think there\\'s a \\'helmed\\' warrior is that an actual word? ok, is it a word in the helmeted context? @rogue00 it looks as though it meets user story requirements.... i\\'d center stuff though (everything is left justified with a lot of white space in multiple viewports) you\\'d be surprised how much things like grammar can torpedo a good page yeah, probably not super popular down this way wow, switching from that pen back to pure white background ... made me dizzy i haven\\'t seen xtc mentioned in many moons  i\\'m not but i live in the south depends. hang on yeah that\\'s what i\\'m looking at.... you don\\'t have any containers, columns or rows etc. if you just center stuff..... (without columns) it ends up looking weird @rogue00 you\\'re presented with a choice i mean i think it will pass as is but.... awesome checkout bootstrap docs.... and familiarize with grid. if not the bootstrap route, check sites like css-tricks http://getbootstrap.com/css/ https://css-tricks.com/ i have to add that i (like a lot of other people (if they\\'re honest)) underestimated css welcome @suvreial and @praveen-sambu  yeah, that is a pretty good (and straightforward) grid example. depends on the context http://nerds.airbnb.com/mysql-in-the-cloud-at-airbnb/ @chrisdziewa don\\'t know.... i was going to say (millage may vary) but i got stuck on the rapid fire questions so, let\\'s slow down a bit @praveen-sambu  relational databases (sql) are different from no-sql (e.g., mongodb)  the former is typically broken down by entity relationships (separate tables pk/fk keys that sort of thing) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codd%27s_12_rules the latter (no-sql) is more of a document model that scales well.... https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained (there\\'s a whitepaper you can download) mongoose doesn\\'t supplant mongo it\\'s used in conjunction with node and mongo...... ( i was going through a tut that actually used mongoose yesterday... still learning this though) my background is more in relational stuff and that\\'s my comfort zone  - but am a least learning about the dark side (no sql) so let me ask you have you googled this? please tell me yes lol nan welcome @nabendu82  i think that\\'s also a track to (paid) cert  if you want to go \\'all in\\' with mongo the learning part is free.... but the cert has a fee associated not a bad deal yeah, you can get the knowledge free i was thinking about that graphic (seen it a couple of times) where\\'d you grab it from? yeah that\\'s more succinct.... my thing is demands are different... so it\\'s not apples to apples in some (many cases) it depends mongodb.... is good at json type stuff... this is not super complex data but scales well.... relational databases aren\\'t going to disappear  @praveen-sambu again it\\'s context what kind of relationships? @praveen-sambu so how much capital do you have to start this airbnb like site? because all the talk of scaling is in itself academic because having that kind of traffic is probably not an issue you\\'re going to have starting out, no? ^good point their pricing isn\\'t bad yeah, there\\'s a freebie tier... but part of the discussion was sql vs. no-sql 30 @praveen-sambu what are you using as a db now? have you mapped out what kind of data you\\'re going to capture? transactions, etc., as well  hey, that\\'s the dude from pbs i remember that show i think i watched that and autoweek  @praveen-sambu it\\'s sounds like the general direction that you\\'ve taken is no-sql (which may be appropriate for your situation or not)... what gave you second thoughts, in terms of factoring in a relational db into the equation? cra^ low on coffee i knew i forgot something yeah, cause now i\\'m thinking.... nan but i wake up if i don\\'t have enough caffeine  (odd as it sounds) yeah, it\\'s true nan nan it waved at me, and i was like wow wait, that\\'s total recall  what was that thing called yes! nan wait, that\\'s arnold on mars nan nan nan but no, actually arnold\\'s disguise mask was the best a lot of the futuristic stuff in that movie doesn\\'t seem so futuristic now oh sweet i haven\\'t heard *palm* in so long i want my blackberry back, ftw yeah, i\\'d chicken out on a blackberry (anything) purchase these days.... oh, nice  true, but that comes with a lot of risk what about bluetooth albeit slow one @thaniri try adding target=\"_blank\" (to make it open in a new tab) hackish but i tested it and it worked (though i see you have a hard coded test url currently attached to that button cats make the internet go round ```_blank``` ^underscore yeah, i didn\\'t see @jayv30  \\'s post he/she should get the thanks would be an interesting case of brownie damages however, @jayv30 \\'s attorney would likely take 50% of his single brownie so, brownie settlement might be an option but wait-wait... there was no damage as he got a brownie  omg hello we\\'re not bots promise actually i was testing my answer in his pen so i was off screen or her pen work stuff, and learning js/doing the curriculum  yeah, although i do get sidetracked on tuts if something interests me among all the things so far i\\'ve encountered node keeps calling me \"hey, i\\'m node.... you like me don\\'t you?\" no. \"oh, come on....\" sqlite3 ? i dunno i don\\'t do any mobile stuff but do use that in batch scripts sometimes... for non-heavy stuff (lite) nan you\\'re building something within the construct of a program (you\\'re not really building anything but selecting from options) nan @rogue00  maybe react native is what you\\'re after (i\\'m not looking forward to react) (difficult)  eclipse is java yeah....  @anthonygallina1 is into java (and eating fresh rabbits) he could chime in on this don\\'t use the ones that have different color eyes  welcome @bitroger  welcome @ljoseph13 jump in (not here but the actual curriculum) and make it happen here (gitter) is sort of a purgatory  nan nan i\\'m just kidding.... if you need any help this is a great place  https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/official-free-code-camp-chat-rooms they took away cabinetry  wtf build cabinets... varnish .... that kind of thing  @wasong yes however only those challenges with ```*``` are required wait what? np @rogue00 if you have evangelists amassing an army outside your house learning mobile is the least of your problems he could summon yanni  nan hay :sparkles:  i\\'m getting the lingo now..... no, time for \\'hey\\' @abhisekp i think that looks pretty good i was thinking the same thing (text within the nav or box)..... i think the person that had the original sketch was talking about links  @abhisekp i like the vegas sky @abhisekp it gave you a parse error first..... i didn\\'t know gitter could display that in chat yes, i did  @abhisekp i don\\'t really know how to get the buttons over to the right (all the absolute this and that so stuff didn\\'t work) so, just did a hackish -px https://jsfiddle.net/2lfb48dp/ out of my comfort zone with pure css (getting comfy with bootstrap but that\\'s bad (i think) so...) don\\'t mind hacking away until the right way presents itself @abhisekp  that\\'s what you wanted, no? are you telling me that\\'s **not** what you wanted ok, fine.... what was the requirement again? nan yeah, but i thought in your earlier comments you said something like \"too bad i can\\'t get the buttons to the right\".... (yeah, the guy\\'s sketch was buttons on the left) yes, and i saw the subtle highlighting around the font (kudos) am i dreaming this? i\\'m too lazy to scroll do it you will learn more by showing what you got (even if you look like an a^^) don\\'t be afraid i\\'m not talking about projects what? i am getting low on coffee... my point is stretch beyond your comfort zone face palm @abhisekp looks like bob has the answer did you view source? or inspect element? on that?

(midori) lol i did something similar with an ancient netbook (specs aren\\'t really that different from a pi) what kind of memory do those have? @sludge256 yep, exactly (mem wise) as the netbook project.... really struggles  from bears shame on you :metal:  actually thinking back to one of @spatzerny \\'s posts.... it\\'s the first time i\\'ve been given \"the bird\" from an actual bird no, i mean that  in a good way like very creative @dylandknight how did you get the green effect? i\\'ve had this problem as well no actually turning green nan @storbeck avoid designers at all costs how\\'d the move go? wow that\\'s seriously efficient move  explain format ooh nice.... (btw what kind of switch do you have on the double monitor hookup to laptop? foreground) yeah, i assumed both of those monitors where plugged to lap see that\\'s what i\\'m trying to get around (for laptop) i don\\'t want a kvm..... i can use dual monitor and drag stuff around, but adding a third with same functionality woudl be cool yeah have an hdmi output.... but for the cheapy (my likely case)  3rd  monitor probably no hdmi input brackets and geany (sometimes sublime) nan nan gitter log: *this message was deleted* i\\'m looking forward to sass.... sass pastafarian? nan yeah i can\\'t go pastafarian: it\\'s incompatible with my sacred :chicken:  it\\'s not polite to ask that lol he is totally don\\'t get @combsco started on laravel... he has the poster and everything yeah, that was kind of weird @abhisekp have you started messing with sass yet? gd nooo that\\'s the whole point of the course (to take it).. you will get plenty o\\' plenty of js here i assure you no, it\\'s just that js evolved .... if you\\'re looking at it from a late 90s perspective you\\'re in for a shock actual paper i have the loudest owls where i live good grief they don\\'t even wait until the sun fully sets **g**ood **d**oritos i like that however, the :chicken: doesn\\'t approve :chicken:  they were not referencing google drive no you weren\\'t what @combsco are you trying to animate that ? oh people probably are more apt to help if they sense that you value their time depends on the context and scope i can mentor you in hand modeling @jbmartinez  but you must promise not to give away trade secrets @rphares wanted to go down the hand modeling route; however, i think she\\'s not cut out for it (too nice in a very mean business). shhhh don\\'t tell her. nice... what are you escaping to? @mosaic-greg reporting is good stuff congrats shhhhh you are soooooo nice yeah, d3 is interesting stuff wait, i have to show  you both (again) where you\\'re at now vs. where you can be in hand modeling @rphares and @jbmartinez  brb wait, my hand modeling mentoring materials are on my laptop..... nice try at contrived meanness   @jbmartinez and @rphares i know that you\\'ve seen this \\'chart\\' before however, i feel that repetition is important in all things (especially hand modeling) are you ready? nan you both are very much in the before category @jbmartinez and @rphares  but it\\'s ok.... i\\'m here for you i\\'m just gonna leave that for a few more seconds so that it can sink in nín hǎo howdy @jackel27  what? i always go for more formal greeting @zerelt did you get the pen (vs. jsbin) sorted out? @zerelt i can see why this is making you crazy (went down the same red herrings in codepen) only thing seems to be console output (take a look) maybe it\\'s http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30465651/passing-keys-to-children-in-react-js - but no clue i want to be like @combsco  @zerelt i knew there was a reason why i had apprehension for the react part of course...lol  or have pretty hands (always the hand model) yes, haven\\'t *heard that* before i want to be known for my coding skills, not my pretty hands #3. is the best if i were a hiring mgr, i\\'d hire you @combsco  yeah that\\'s great they\\'re interested or they wouldn\\'t waste the time you have to give them a non standard response nan nan that\\'s the hand model approach might not work in other sectors oh, bad that\\'s \\'the question\\' for me.... i\\'m like \\'flat\\' no. yeah, i\\'d have gone for st. pete too at least you\\'re not in jacksonville @combsco you\\'re going to do ok.  how is this possible @rphares do you greet everybody gitter is a resource pig oink gitter oink there\\'s even a snout pane @lawlietblack are you \\'settling\\' for coding? tisk a lot of abstract math makes my head hurt  not my thing that sucks what is ? you don\\'t have to @rphares you are so nice... what the he^^ is wrong with you? lol it is when i did my hello w....

(your latter example happens to evaluate nicely into 0.35) @johnqq i\\'m (still) going with tofixed on this b/c even though you\\'re using number it\\'s still the same https://repl.it/bpnn/1 @nickelghost are you talking about the editor ? i think it\\'s codemirror @nickelghost maybe jade (but don\\'t quote me ) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=jade @nickelghost it\\'s express; however, don\\'t know if it\\'s express *with* ejs (you can take a look at the map) @nickelghost i\\'d say poke around a bit... click a link or two since they use jade in the actual project (as well as at the exercises at user level ) and point to https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks (which again, i understand the distinction there - thanks) in the exercises, i\\'d say jade @nickelghost  @ukurochka clearly you\\'re not  :smile:  how could you be what you say in your introduction (\"stupid idiot\" and i\\'m quoting you) if you\\'ve taken the first step to learning something, @ukurochka ? this doesn\\'t seem to be \\'idiot\\' behavior. @codemzy you changed your avatar @khalysi this sounds like the undocumented bootstrap class \\'makespacey\\' @frdmn i don\\'t no.... but humor can be dicey over different languages @kekau92 looks good. i\\'d add another (outer) wikipedia link(main)  (in addition to the sound file) hiya @huanga1  me too... they added it after i started @jbmartinez did you figure out the mixed content .psd from non ps (opening)? ok, let me check... (i totally forgot) :worried:  @jbmartinez yeah, there are subtle things that just \\'won\\'t happen\\' in a lot of utilities. you can run older versions of ps in wine.... i haven\\'t attempted new.... does adobe still have actual evaluation trial download - ? (maybe that might work) - trial, convert, happy-happy. not sure why gimp wouldn\\'t work (would check some boards on that).... but i\\'m still thinking imagemagick would convert (but you\\'re not going to retain layers) @jbmartinez total roll of the dice but, http://superuser.com/questions/471446/take-a-psd-and-export-all-the-layers-into-separate-image-files-without-using-pho -- check the last answer (never used this tool but...just ideas) :sweat_drops:  @arielleslie you\\'re not *one of those office people* that leaves balloons (with helium) around until they hang half way from the top of cubicle to floor are you? @arielleslie demand refund do it @arielleslie  but.... she/he might notice their balloon next to your work area that could get dicey oh, so it\\'s not a personalized balloon (e.g., happy birthday larry)... that might work then nan nan i mean that is brilliant (my new approach) ^ :thumbsup:  nan i am so not joking nan me too oh, i can summarize nan nan @khalysi does it have led light? (fan) @khalysi oh, that\\'s different (it\\'s a cpu fan) yeah... those are fun to mess with *never* try to remove one with a cold board yeah i think you said tower fan (usually can be a mix of things like big fans, little fans etc., that control air flow through the box itself) here\\'s a fun experiement take a really old monitor (ones that despite any settings have a dingy white appearance on screen) and place it next to a modern display ..... you\\'ll get dizzy after awhile  yeah my main dual setup is modern + modern... but i got the dumb idea of taking an old monitor and experimenting --- really messed up my vision for about 1/2 hour yeah, one thing about macs is their displays are sharp as he^^ (one thing i can\\'t harp on mac about ) @leecroydon are you certain that you\\'ve implemented it correctly ? @leecroydon cool @leecroydon it looks good i resized it in browser and ran through a simulator (a lame online one but still) .... and nav has expected behavior in terms of sizing  did i miss something? ok, hang on let me check @leecroydon  @brianamarie :smile: haven\\'t seen you in awhile  @leecroydon  the links work (in simulator) but the nav (in pancake) extends to a lot of the viewport so it\\'s not that they\\'re not necessarily working... but you may not be able to see the content below (are you seeing a browser scroll apart from the nav?). michael jackson was a boxer too? @leecroydon did you see my previous comment? @leecroydon ok, let me look at it on an actual apple device (vs. simulator ) brb wait, that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to do @leecroydon (hamburger) you don\\'t get a dropdown? when you click that button i\\'m going to re-post your pen link so i can grab it off of here @leecroydon \\nhttp://codepen.io/leecroydon/full/lgwnvb @leecroydon i think it has something to do with codepen (with iphone)... it has a demo \\'frame\\' (i.e., the codepen page itself) surrounding your  demo. so, if you scroll you\\'re not getting an actual real view of the behavior because the fixed nav scrolls too. i don\\'t have the answer .... but i\\'d google pens and iphone (sorry...) dc isn\\'t cheap oh, that dc lol because dc metro property values are insane @abhisekp hover over my avatar ok now hover over my avatar yes, we\\'re proud here in malibu india lol not all certs are equal @sludge256 that is a good cert @rphares you haven\\'t given me any valuable feedback for project: elvis re-animator  not costello no, but reanimate is probably the wrong word... i need to clone elvis nan @rphares thoughts? how long does that take the projects will help in that department (learning / reinforcement ) oh, great there\\'s a tornado watch for my area ~~malibu~~ durham hope i don\\'t end up in really ugly shoes with a house landing on the bad witch (there really is a tornado warning though...sucks) thank you @rphares for erm both  i\\'m going to go with not red and glittery though yeah to where is the concern yeah, no... if you wear red glittery shoes you\\'re probably going to be teleported to the bad side of town with equally tacky dress.  so, i\\'ll take my chances with tornado  <----sidesteps fashion debate\\'s third rail  @geperezg don\\'t worry this isn\\'t aol is that python?

(from my interactions with said.. folks) remember us @alicejiang1 i think you have a point.. maybe a hybrid technical/client facing role would work for you (you\\'re articulate and have a good sense of humor).... i\\'d say pass on the recruiting but that\\'s just my opinion  yeah and never remove heatsink on a cold board the paste turns to glue and you know just how many pins are on the cpu welcome @rigaac  and @jklmnop23  omg my favorite movie programmer is newman (he will always be known as that no matter what) in jurasic park (original) ever seen seinfeld? nerd cage match did gitter change something? ....i got taken to \\'hey explore stuff and you can download stuff when i logged into this room\" you need a good pro wrestling name @abhisekp  junkyard-pi-kp rowdy-roddy-abhisekep-**pi**(e)per no, that doesn\\'t work....doesn\\'t have enough of a pro wrestling feel to it we have to take abhisekp out of the ring name is cricket like hockey without the ice? lol welcome @sandypam  i\\'m just looking at the cricket stick things... reminds me of hockey which a civilized sport indeed so, both games are kind of like a piñata then? hmmm so, are there cricket leagues? i did.  apparently cricket is a very loud bug @lizardbrains what are you having trouble with? ok link the codepen link paste it here and it will embed  @lizardbrains why do you have scss enabled (doesn\\'t look sass like ) @lizardbrains you\\'re not doing any pre-processing disable that and it will render @qmikew1 notes @jbmartinez \\'s queston @lizardbrains also, i see the humor in the pen/approach ....but there was a minute where i thought it was rogue code no let\\'s step back for a second let me go back to my original comment, i wasn\\'t saying to enable sass.... i was saying to disable scss (the sass like comment was confusing sorry about that)... you\\'re doing plain css... @lizardbrains  but your question \"doesn\\'t fcc use.....\" @lizardbrains .....was just wondering how you made the jump to scss? (i know you\\'ve got it all sorted out and everything) btw @rphares how\\'s it going ok lol i\\'m not being helpful.... i think i\\'m being confusing which is the opposite hey ok the question sprout consumption check @rphares  hmmm i\\'m going to help you with your sprout withdraw symptoms welcome @jabunga  that actually sounds good except the fiber don\\'t know what that\\'s about only those with ```*``` are required but what\\'s with the bran thing do you eat it with everything? @scrufflynx dude good choice (and nice work) @rphares what? it\\'s worse than i thought no gasp sure @pandoriummmm  @pandoriummmm you want to paste the code explain format @combsco you need batteries for what? @pandoriummmm paste all of the code @pandoriummmm ok, good job getting the code into chat... what\\'s the name of the challenge (i think i know the name....but don\\'t want to guess) @pandoriummmm look at the example  in the left pane.....(still with me?) ok, if you look at the example think of it this way... they want you to nest what\\'s currently in the editor to what\\'s between ><  so: what would you put between ```<form action=\"/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data\"></form>```? (also, you\\'d have to change it to: ```action=\"/submit-cat-photo``` but go with the main idea first right that would be nested in the form action stuff might look like ```<form action=\"/submit-cat-photo\">nestsomestuffhere</form>``` ok, that\\'s the example with literal stuff... you have to replace it with actual url let\\'s try again.... nest what you have in editor within this: ```<form action=\"/submit-cat-photo\">nestsomestuffhere</form>``` \"nestsomestuffhere\" would be ```<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"cat photo url\">``` nice rock on :metal:  oh, wait.... @khalysi not as vars though @pandoriummmm  they\\'re just getting you used to the syntax of things. form actions are beyond the scope of that particular exercise (later you\\'ll learn more) but for now maybe http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_action.asp @combsco buy cupcakes for said seasoned colleague @pandoriummmm you\\'ll do fine. just keep at it  @qmikew1 notes that @rphares likes to keep me off balance @qmikew1 by being nice @alicejiang1 are you replying this presentation in your mind she\\'s totally mean to me what\\'s the definition of success ( @rphares in this context) ? ohhhhhh yes, you\\'ve come a long very well but.. @rphares  @greenandblue654 why are you thanking everybody no brownies should be earned (even though there\\'s no real value to those) lol irony  oh, lord @lagger-camp that\\'s the most succinct styling critique i\\'ve heard (in this context). lol @lagger-camp the answer is no. but i think there are some extension that allow you to change background color (chrome) @qmikew1 wonders which hideous hand nan @qmikew1 wonders if @rphares has gone into sprout coma later @jbmartinez  where\\'s my ad money @danjfletcher i get correct weather.... but in jquery it looks like you intended to show an image that relates to current conditions...  @sludge256  a problem i should have i wish current conditions (in my city) were in the 70+ range winter stinks and so do wrong numbers waking me from my slumber welcome @longbeach  lag check wat :wave:  x2 :metal:  looks like a depends outer garment that\\'s seriously ugly clothing no, you could hold 180 days worth i\\'m sure no please no please don\\'t play into the nerd stereotypes hmmm @kylepeeler everybody is different ....but i\\'d start with the challenges from start -> completion of basic js ..at that point you\\'ll probably want to dig into js a little more deeply ..start with http://eloquentjavascript.net/   (also, fcc does react (your second question)) no machines will learn then were\\'s screwed nan is that guy playing tetris? what\\'s that is it a beeper  would that be a mirror or an oyster shell welcome @master54321  red or blue isn\\'t that a bug in beginning state oh wait @rphares  nan i know....

(there are more)) yes i log out of course you don\\'t log out? i\\'ve never seen myself no i get that i\\'m talking about me that moose must have some serious dry eyes welcome @moosecantblink  @shiv921 yes i haven\\'t completed the certs, but there are people who have @shiv921 i think the market place will determine that... fcc is pretty new so, it\\'s kind of tough to answer that welcome @raokikrishnan  nan if you want to broaden the topic a bit .... different certs (imo) carry different weight @fikriloniamus relational or no-sql? or both @fikriloniamus hmmm there are a number of ways, i\\'d first start learning sql (there are free courses)... if you want to delve into theory i think there are also free online university courses, - but just setting up maybe your own mysql or ms sql db and messing around is probably a good start.... relational wise, you probably want to know this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codd%27s_12_rules wait you said you wanted relational now you change your mind fine... try mongodb university know the difference first though @leinadp but you\\'ll lose pmi cert (just kidding) one thing that sucks is academic credentials and certs don\\'t (really imo) have any bearing on who or what makes somebody a good -insert whatever here- but, it\\'s hr people and machines that are the gatekeepers in a lot contexts can\\'t always discount this stuff... just sayin he roped you into a hard fee lol @leinadp go and \\'be free\\' :smile:  @leinadp i actually thought about going down that road... so i\\'ve looked at the requirements etc. it\\'s pretty involved (real hours etc.)... but when you\\'ve decided that you want to do something else...just do it (there will be a comfort level drop for a while i think... but that\\'s always there) don\\'t fear the reaper  @leinadp oh, you\\'re hardcore you\\'ll do fine then @spatzerny another walken \\'gem\\' is from pulp fiction (however, not appropriate for this room lol) yes and now i give it to you yeah, but paragraph #2 (which was omitted (good choice) is where it gets funnier)) wow @johnnycooper looks great (functionality is all there).... only thing i\\'d offer is there should be an event that clears the default text on enter/over/click whatever..... because you have to delete that text to search also, @johnnycooper i think there should be an octopus in the crystal ball... (but this is all subjective) lol good job @7speter i think @frdmn is thinking ahead a bit (not just answering your immediate question) might be worthwhile to checkout how the grid works (imo....some loathe bootstrap) with good reason in many cases yeah, there are less \\'strappy\\' versions of it.... i\\'ve been reading through some stuff \\' no it\\'s you (90% you (us) ) but that\\'s an actual terminal (be it ubuntu thrown onto c0) c9 why not copy paste into a local file then invoke node on it (with console.log()\\'s peppered throughout) i don\\'t think the aim is to have a fully functional tool (really (imo) you should be transitioning to your own tools (techniques.... you can stay in terminal all you want on your own dev box)  this is more for instruction how so nan dang keyboard purple octopus :+1:  don\\'t know no pressure there @mikepeiman  welcome @zachalewel what\\'s your queston you can pull image into gitter drag @jamesdimi depends on your end goal (define that first)  that\\'s an er diagram with primary and foreign keys  @zachalewel https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagram-symbols-and-meaning oh, whoops didn\\'t see your second image hang on  @zachalewel so i see you have count desc (that would work) but i see an inner join (maybe left or right as case may be) would be better? on inventory that is @zachalewel  still around? your (key) path looks sound... why not group by on rental date? and film_id (sorry trying to follow the er diagram) right but the number of rental dates paired to the film_id would give you a count  the film_id (and its path (or relationship) back to category table (i.e., your genre alias) would be the route (at least from what i see without any actual data to play with) - to the rental dates. you can get its popularity from the number of rental dates (group by again ) paired to category.id, category.name (omit category.id from columns though) backtick is left of 1 key top row (us keyboards) explain format you have to paste the code in between the backticks (like a sandwich) nan yeah, i did that a long time ago, (notice the brown icon vs green) @zachalewel there are a couple of options  are you just trying to get the stats as an ad hoc thing? or do you have this paired to some sort of web front end? or...are you trying to create a report based on that statement no @zachalewel one more thing ... if you\\'re going to do a group by on rental return date you\\'re going to need to format it first (from table def looks like a timestamp field) @zachalewel don\\'t know what dialect this (maybe you\\'re using mysql).... but if it\\'s a one time thing (and it\\'s not part of a live interface (be it a report or frontend or both) you could do a group by (and formatting) on just the rental table and dump into a temp... table and then do the joins back to category based on that. (without seeing actual data, scope (and knowing your skillset) it might be difficult to give advice in this context......  @melanquince boostrap is suggested for ease of use very  you will get plenty of js i\\'d go with browser gitter not so great on mobile edit. gitter sucks on mobile @willtravelforfun yeah, but did you know the whole time you were using it there was a bunch of gibberish characters with every post? @willtravelforfun no. i\\'m kidding but it still sucks yeah tip: don\\'t wear motley crue shirt on skype interview yeah that\\'s a good tip also relational stuff isn\\'t going to disappear but no-sql can\\'t be ignored (if you look at ads you can see companies are starting to play with both (or a least dipping their toes in)) eh, depends on the complexity of the data..... not everything fits into a document store model hmm i\\'d look at normalization concepts @allanx2000 (that comment doesn\\'t make sense in the relational (sense)) @allanx2000 right i don\\'t think we\\'re talking about the same thing (in terms of what\\'s appropriate for no-sql vs. relational model) @effinawesome it\\'s a regional thing..... if the other was used, somebody else would then have the same comment  small talk? @willtravelforfun i\\'d say mirror  the person you\\'re assisting/serving. not everybody likes small talk. (some yep, some, nope) nan nan i\\'m pretty sure i\\'ve gotten zero done today i blame @sludge256  but the avocado was eaten for our..... wait.. mixed metaphor and totally the opposite these humans seem to use symbolic language and are fond of this: ``` ` ``` thing welcome @hnuur  can i \\'like\\' the avacado welcome @elmouad  sadly i think you\\'re right serious pickle who knew? yeah, i\\'m feeling out of touch lol yeah but they used \\'then\\' in place of \\'than\\' (no, no when insulting (even if by pickle)) speaking of welcome @rphares  nooo don\\'t say that to your mom (@rphares) oh, saw the edit \\'man\\' vs. \\'ma\\' no way <----retains \\'the figure\\' allthough old and crusty probably applies i first thought that i was being unproductive today; however, the pickle conversation changed my mind. be worried granny mine too it\\'s called roxanne  by the police you don\\'t have to put on that fb dress.... raaaaaaa (phonetic) ckssan.. you don\\'t have to ok, doesn\\'t translate to text well yeah i tried gasp what\\'s up with country restrictions on youtube other than authoritarian states i mean ugh @spat92 throw your code into repl.it (or paste it here)...... and folks will look at it wait? you\\'re not testing the individual items in the array, you\\'re not going to get a valid answer.- or filtering those based on a condition (would be a callback)  oh really class=\"class1 class2\" are you sure? your mojito was lost in transit note the avocado\\'s mouth (mojito destroyer) @qmikew1 wonders if chat logs retain avatar\\'s state at time of comment (because when sludge changes his avatar again, \\'mojito destroyer\\' will make no sense ok delete that hover over the ```...``` it\\'s not the url.... it\\'s the code (your code) that is needed class=\"class1 class2\".... so it might look like class=\"smaller-image thick-green-border\" ... did you create the thick-green-border class (and put stuff in it)? ok, post the code from the editor copy paste here (all of it) i would add the formatting bit ... but it\\'s not important at the moment you have class2 that\\'s wrong go back to my previous post > class=\"class1 class2\".... so it might look like class=\"smaller-image thick-green-border\" ... did you create the thick-green-border class (and put stuff in it)? yeah where\\'s our free stuff @theepdinker  what starbucks? you want me to visit? (zombie trance) well, yeah i did but it\\'s so fresh and tasty there they have wifi... too congrats :metal:  @alicejiang1 don\\'t take my seat or outlet you\\'ve already insulted my singing what? @blues003 yes keep going @blues003 everybody has their own learning style. i\\'d say that if you\\'re having trouble with a specific exercise (or as you go a long) ask a question here. (and research outside of the fcc website... it\\'s encouraged) not yet @aledwassell i use brackets yeah but me an @jbmartinez are characters and pixelated features how do you know we\\'re even humna err human humna is good too yoda i use kubuntu but plasma 5 was shipped too soon (a lot of broken cra^) ranch dressing is good too btw i told you mern is a :chicken: disease oracle loves you @combsco  i\\'ve learned not to \\'hate on (technologies)\\' really anything (except windows (just kidding)) -- employers have something (insert whatever) and need people to deal with that something and want to pay people for..... - so they drive it (it\\'s ok to be a tech wh**e) true @alicejiang1 you need a nickname you do ? but you have that as a nickname i\\'m thinking i can multi-task yes, you took over my body @combsco (i will be contacting a priest soon) learn whatever vendor stuff... you\\'re not selling your soul (in most cases) justkrautus @alicejiang1  yeah that\\'s good ok i\\'ll try again market demand and you i\\'m still working on the nickname hiya @rohitp01  i can\\'t now i\\'m on a nickname mission retry i have some schaum\\'s outlines with c++ and java (never really touched those, got em at a book sale) it\\'s like a language love connection? ot that was an errant keyboarding ty for that @combsco  it was worth the wall for me, really? what can i say?  @combsco hmm nan that was wrong lol i couldn\\'t help it @abhisekp did you fix the es6 arrows? nice but those coffee cups are expensive  k-cup f that @da7thsin do you have a pen? why not link it? is it sharpie @combsco  a* @da7thsin which part isn\\'t working for you? yeah, the correct pane thing is valid.... but in a nutshell what\\'s the expected behavior (and which element (a lot of colors there) @da7thsin  np that\\'s funny orange park is a place near jax fl welcome @orangepark  not snot near those are pretty easy utilities/commands in terminal  (or in bash) @da7thsin help me here... what do you want to see in your page (i.e., what do you see that is wrong or needs to be tweaked) do you want to center h3? @combsco i understand your gitter stats yeah, 74% oh why do you have this app? yes ok, @da7thsin  for your use? don\\'t you already instinctively know what you\\'re wasting time on? @da7thsin have you tried putting the background images in individual class @da7thsin background-image part is key http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp @combsco yeah i was going to say.... how are you still employed with that score lol ugh why do you need an app to tell you (in essence) \\'you suck, and you\\'re wasting too much time\\'? i mean it\\'s just validating what you (in whatever case) already know agree with that approach wait, you should **not** use imgur (it\\'s against their tos and they block images at times) or you can do that or use another service that\\'s not realistic? welcome @awan21clouds  ok it works @combsco see this software only makes you feel bad about yourself  it\\'s evil lol there are a lot awesome people here @awan21clouds (i\\'m not one) lol yeah, time trackers i don\\'t get thank you @anthonygallina1  now i must steal your brownies i agree that you should have benchmarks and general outlines of time to do stuff... but it\\'s finishing it (no matter how long it takes) is kind of where i come from @combsco what\\'s your goal? learning stuff @combsco  lol you can sometimes get locked into the efficiency trap (i.e., you\\'re meeting all of your self imposed criteria...yet, still feel wanting) grid without the \\'strappy-ness\\' not so bad welcome @chinuxparibus  wait, did you just \\'plug\\' your blog (just kidding) hi i am noob and want to make pretty things... @combsco please help my dream is to make a site about an elvis/octopus hybrid (octoelvis) no, octoelvis is my dream i suck but i can live with that lol one day octoelvis will help people with things like doing the dishes and singing to them while doing the dishes no, they stole my idea my glyph had tentacles and a 70s elvis outline @anthonya97 can you paste what you got? (probably best to format) explain format why @anthonya97 there\\'s some stuff missing there and  that has implications for classes that you\\'d apply to div and the stuff nested within @anthonya97 hmmm maybe a bug in there as an aside.... if you put your opening <div> tag above ```<h2 class=\"red-text\">catphotoapp</h2>``` it passes (contrary to instructions) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/issues/7261 - not commenting on the validity but i see something different (the fact that it will pass if you put opening div above h2).... @anthonya97 up to you but it will pass if you place opening div above .. ok, i\\'m done i think the power of regex is being lost on small strings.... try thinking about it in terms of huge files yeah, that\\'s true but its real utility isn\\'t only in js implementations  yeah perl... awk i think is more powerful than sed... but i\\'m more comfortable with sed for whatever reason hiya @rexchip  heya dang salary and age  hey @akiralaine  howdy @akiralaine i modified your nickname for @alicejiang1  justkrautus alice + sour kraut no? justkrautus she doesn\\'t seem to be supportive of my nickname idea issues with pickled cabbage? i\\'ll have to dig deep for another nickname idea @colliedg while it\\'s true that classes are separated by spaces (e.g., class=\"class1 class2\" and you passed the challenge) i think the point was missed because ```$(\"button\").removeclass(\"btn-default\");``` targets **all** buttons without having to work so hard. rock on :smile:  cud = :cow2:  @melontest this is a javascript centric room..... (if you\\'re looking at native apps you\\'re probably thinking java..

(it does get easier don\\'t get me wrong)  from a consumer point of view.... i say (maybe you missed the \\'ilk\\' part) lol @combsco i\\'m going to make you a dreamweaver tribute page (i\\'m sure i can find a discounted version somewhere) i\\'m not advocating dreamweaver  for pete\\'s sake even worse lol (frontpage) i love how everybody is a css expert (there are folks here who are, though) don\\'t front lol noo don\\'t do it @jbmartinez it\\'s a trap @cjleeuk i believe there is a nightmode that will be put into production no idea when @jbmartinez http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/start-programming-swift-ubuntu/ but i didn\\'t tell you about it you have a dark side? do you eat seals or use a lot of non sustainable styrofoam cups? @khalysi  (dark side) what are you going to build with this voodoo @khalysi  i wished /collapse worked on formatted (or even better un-formatted ) code (maybe it does now: haven\\'t checked in awhile)  @fatehbou19 that\\'s a pretty broad question..... are there particular things you\\'re having trouble (with)? if things are \\'ugly\\' in general, don\\'t worry: it\\'s a problem that many of us have i can wish @jbmartinez  @tedcode0 nope. the curriculum is targeted towards beginners  you don\\'t need prior coding knowledge @tedcode0  @combsco what\\'s the current % of coding time ( @combsco uses a time tracker (with app categories)) winamp was cool run it in wine ftw penguin actually, if you want to talk about windows programs that actually work (i\\'m not a huge windows fan)... for sound editing goldwave (eval ware) is great (better than audacity imo) @rphares sprout intake check true nan nan it\\'s the swift (getting to her) ```/me your comment``` i want coffee wtf?

no do you see why having an id fired that i saw (in the first iteration) a lot of class names that don\\'t exist anywhere... my guess is you\\'re confusing (dom) element selectors vs. class or id selectors  hang on @bulldogmolly i think this might help http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp (you need this first before you can get to the other stuff) @bulldogmolly yeah i know but i think you\\'re extrapolating something from the lessons incorrectly (just a feeling) @bulldogmolly there\\'s also a bootstrap nav (since you\\'re using bootstrap)  the whole point of the portfolio is to bang your head against the wall :smile:  you\\'re doing great do they have bogo welcome @rvrajavijay94  @rsmith731 \\nlogo:``` http://codepen.io/bootstrapped/details/kwygwq/ ```(this person\\'s pen is interesting)\\nlogo with text: (note whoever did this \\'fiddle\\'didn\\'t put a lot into link quality/hosting)http://www.bootply.com/f6dapkmdkt  @kennikuyou do you have a pen link (can look at in both browsers) @brandonay probably the latter is a good approach.... until you reach beginning algos (then time to read up) sure @kennikuyou  k depends.... sudo is safer than dropping to a root shell @kennikuyou am gonna rawgit it https://rawgit.com/kennikuyou/mse-store/development/index.html  (so others can look as well) @kennikuyou i don\\'t see any difference in rendering (apart from small browser diffs)\\n> hey guys ive got a question, i have a full width and height header and a logo in the center with text below. it renders perfectly on chrome but when i open the page in mozilla, some of the text goes below the header right under the next section, how is this happening?

(and doc ready might help too) @96street you\\'re right i looked at that for a lightening second before switching to something else (my bad) @96street but let\\'s step back... for a second am looking at it now @96street are you really sold on putting stuff like events in tags? @michaelmrose what is that? yeah it seems they are conflating  true but they are selling two things totally unrelated like \"we are an earth moving business that focus on js based apps\" totally different @anthonya97 broken image link here beware the penguin solid kubuntu/xubuntu/various windows vm(s)....  try installing vmware on it and tryout linux  dual boot yes i\\'d keep that partition ntfs oh, different drive yeah i got a dual drive setup too on one of my boxes  ubuntu you can get stuff done i like to tinker with distros but sometimes i just want crap to work when i need it (hence the \\'buntu based distros) arch does have great documentation mint is derivative of ubuntu (or was) .... but a little different.  not a bad distro @rphares where do you weigh in  i used to kind of like enlightenment desktop (either over *buntu or over *buntu via bodhi) puppy is a great thing to have on a usb.. puppy has some issues (imo) with their security model true but everything that\\'s root user right off the bat.. is problematic i like puppy for its utility factor (keeps an .sfs file where you want it either on same usb or another drive) has lots of stuff if you need it you\\'re a mac user huh? ( @rphares ) i have a working theory @anthonygallina1 yeah they actually have default wallpapers of puppies omg @rphares hates puppies (what?) you can\\'t own a puppy you befriend it (sigh, you and your *western* ways @rphares  yes this is why.... i agree @rphares why do you not like puppies i must know what was that movie with the mean woman played by glenn close who did **not** like puppies no that\\'s not it ok, wait she didn\\'t like rabbits  wrong movie yeah ^ no, i was just noting how she went from an intense (psychopathic not mean) role in that movie to sort of  mean in the disney movie ( kind of like ice cube the rapper doing family movies ..weird how careers go after time) never heard of it no such thing @revisualize how did they rope you into that clause? (that\\'s pretty broad) i\\'m talking about the latter \\'intangible property clause\\' what are the outer limits of that? hmmm they sound like d\\' bags if you developed something unrelated to what that/your company does would that contract language attempt to press ownership on **your** intellectual property? i understand the non-compete clause (not an attorney thank you very much) but the second part sounds a little shady @revisualize yeah, defiantly the bad blood part (gotta eat)... but i read that paragraph as  \"you have to let them know, they have to keep it confidential (patents, processes, etc., and *you* would be responsible for filing any associated paperwork with \"stuff\" to whatever entity. you\\'re agreeing to disclosure; but not permission (putting your code code on github doesn\\'t seem to me something that they can enforce -- but again, not an attorney--- that just sort of pisses me off to hear   yeah, that\\'s usually the case @revisualize  you got off cheap i\\'m going to say react @anisk1992 (looking forward to it. not looking forward to it) it was in the curriculum until recently  these backticks are different night @willtravelforfun you asked that in english oh, but your english is so good lol but that was kind of a random question @willtravelforfun  nan do note that this is an international room wait @willtravelforfun  not crazy but there will be a transition there @eurisko79  @willtravelforfun didn\\'t actually state **why** she needs this @eurisko79 all valid reasons @willtravelforfun yeah, typically you preface *why* you\\'re doing something (helps with participation) ... like if if you say \"give me your finger\" people instinctively want to know *why*   i\\'m convinced @willtravelforfun is building some robot with ~~austrian~~ a german accent but not really giving us much detail yes, put your own spin on it @willtravelforfun .... make that cyborg model do things like vacuuming and being an uber driver ...  yeah it\\'s been done so many times change its hair too ^ that image is being pulled up from konsole (kde default terminal) .... but is that from blender? @sludge256 you\\'re right (has .jpg) extension but the original modeling looks pretty 3d blender\\'ish (exported maybe to .jpg) i\\'d like to learn blender --- sitting on one of my machines collecting dust learning curve looks a bit steep  @eeflores thanks that looks pretty cool oh, great i take back the brownies phuey paaaa tang lol not a bad thing to know about though even if it\\'s more difficult well, i\\'ve been here for 3 hours.. and i feel like a new person now that i know how to make cabinetry @sshashankk   when i get to finish sanding (i think it comes later) i will let you know this is free cabinetry camp right?  oooh, ascii batman fail lol @simulatedgreg these are good things yeah me too any other things you\\'d like to share @simulatedgreg  the simulated version may decide that it likes being yes perhaps you\\'re overcompensating because the real greg is, well, real.... no? how did you come to be simulated? (there\\'s a link back to original in some object philosophy) ubuntu no, use ubuntu you\\'re just starting out with linux? use ubuntu  gnome is cleaner ...kde is more resource heavy but good for workflow (screen edges... and you can pimp the hel^ out of it)... but you can go with a lot of desktops gnome, fallback, plasma(kde).. mate, cinnamon, enlightenment..... or go with a lighter tiling thing like dwm  straight forward/clean xfce noooo not that just a bit @durablemicron did your font inherit the background color? @durablemicron yeah that\\'s part of it (i suspect) but there\\'s some other stuff going on  hang on @durablemicron you know you can do click events from jquery right?  (as an aside) @durablemicron you have background-color and color (white) in your body class... remove that (color in class) and see what happens. (this is what\\'s causing your issue) white text against white background = invisible ink how come hexchat not* i tried that... seem to work pretty well (although i got list of all rooms except this one) pita wait you can\\'t see your own messages? that\\'s weird @willtravelforfun can\\'t top your desire to create a domesticated t2 cyborg go are you going to actually tell us what \\'this\\' is or is it a pause for maximum anticipation effect welcome @medetm  i wanna see the mockup you have to do the mockup yes if you\\'re the idea creator waiting for your own mockup is weird although, if you had multiple personalities that could be technically be possible @onmywayprogram what have you tried so far? you can see your own messages with just irc? (not generated from gitter client) i\\'m going to try to digest you don\\' t know js first @awesomeaniruddh did you go on some sort of js pilgrimage?  yeah, totally .... see that hmmm at all? (like not a delay) no, i\\'m not on hexchat at the moment (have to fire up another box) is it just this room or other too? others this room in particular gave me problems for some reason yeah, the 40,000 + could be the \\'some reason\\' lol there\\'s a blog post http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/06/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it.html oh, so it does it in small # too  weird with different clients as well ? slider icon top (notifications settings) i got nothing yeah, i wondered about that there were like 4-5 heya hang on @sriharshakappala  you have to say h-ello world (dash omitted) see like that welcome @sriharshakappala , @paulgaudet  nothing wrong with reinforcing learning concepts from multiple sources @abhisekp so what do you think about gitter next panel same here... can\\'t find sign-out i may have to things like sign-out are important (kind of like mcdonald\\'s saying \"there will be no ketchup anywhere in store (after upgrade), please enjoy your day\")  @qmikew1 wants ~~ketchup~~ sign-out back oh, well gave it a try gitter (browser) yes, i can just close tab/window but i like the functionality  oh, yeah... (gitter next) @abhisekp yeah, i was trying to give it a chance though @danybr0 welcome what\\'s the challenge name? do not use with the ability to use (brilliant) yes i did totally it was the slider it is pretty but no worky yeah you can collapse... but i think the menu (when enabled) is way too big mega menu bwah hah hah i don\\'t think i am, let me check i\\'ll check that too malibu, india yes... though in the flavor of kanji close (serenity)  atm i wonder if/when github will have a serious competitor  yeah, no matter how great something is.... i get nervous if \\'it\\' is the only (or effectively so) the game in town. competition is good. totally think about that for a moment still no welcomes @combsco  hi no yeah i am dba track (i didn\\'t see the numbering either) @sludge256 ok, yeah it\\'s right there (i just clicked register ) so it\\'s m102 @psrijan i\\'m in the u.s. *and* in front of a laptop @meat147 just to note that fcc switched to react (vs. angular course) - but for me (not necessarily angular...but in general) it brings sort of a modular approach to what could be termed a webapp (sort of pulling a bunch of disparate web stuff into more of a traditional approach).... here\\'s a [quora post](https://www.quora.com/what-are-the-advantages-of-using-angularjs-over-jquery) the author is talking about angular over jquery but i think you can infer the advantages in general with approach (angular or react) tables are so unloved  even when it\\'s appropriate (not some 90s styling hack) i feel wrong somehow using a table (even for tabular data).  the table pendulum has swung too far the other way. columns + rows unite!!!! @darrynwu29 no, (and in that context, it\\'s a good thing) @penguinofthesky do you have a pen link to mess with? oh nvm don\\'t do that lol awesome hail the table and the :chicken:  @sludge256 do you feel weird using table (even though that it\\'s appropriate in that context)? lol so, no or yes (table guilt)? tables are like smokers now shunned and in the cold vs. a billion to assuage your table guilt oh, you\\'re definitely a rebel  but i\\'m talking tabular not evil 90s  btw according to the matrix universe reality stopped and everybody was stuck with win 98 well it was small er https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_04 i\\'m not an angular expert sorry errant answer to a question i saw floating by in my gitter next view @darrynwu29 what was your favorite win 98 feature i liked the default cloud(s) wallpaper.... but am reaching for something more (memory faded) java has a weird trend zigzag.... and  the python trend seems wrong (imo) but awesome thing to envision/realize (expansion of curriculum) :+1:  @sludge256  yes! (embrace thy relational) finally  those are the best, and should be on the value meal @darrynwu29 i switched to linux primary about a decade ago still use windows in vm(s).... (because i can\\'t avoid it) missing design tools? serenity gimp and inkscape i use ps too, but those aren\\'t really \\'design\\' tools in the sense of development.... (if you\\'re printing stuff, sure) @darrynwu29 about three days and fireworks isn\\'t bad i use that too sometimes @darrynwu29 i\\'m not a front end dev hmmm growth is good, but does it become unmanageable  if you stray from core competencies or focus becomes less precise?  excited about the change also, just wondering out loud are you talking about bootstrap\\'s navbar \\'brand\\' element? @heruvimi  you\\'re too picky bring marshmallows  @pgjones72 when you say you **can\\'t** click something what do you mean? (or select etc., unclear) those are called pulls (btw ... yes they\\'re handles) @pgjones72 what kind of device are you using @pgjones72 (browser wouldn\\'t be bad to include - hardware probably not necessary).... but you are placing your mouse pointer in the text editor area and you can\\'t type anywhere? (do you have any blockers?, did it work on other exercises?) @pgjones72 oh, whoops didn\\'t see last post. glad it\\'s working now trout slapping is discouraged @asiyoko  @floydivvi if you like data, yep true gitter wasn\\'t meant for a team of 50,000 people @spatzerny why not get a snake or a fish? (your less legs, less trouble logic seems to point to animals with no legs) well @spatzerny did try to change the subject with his \"ideal cat\" (odd but different subject) there\\'s a reason why you don\\'t use a miter saw to cut your fingernails @spatzerny  http://www.husqvarna.com/us/products/chainsaws/240/967177101/ random unsolicited recruiter email. \"i would appreciate your **prompt** response\"... yeah, f\\' you... (ok, i didn\\'t but felt like it) put your resume out that\\'s the issue @davidpmacneil  these people are nowhere near my state some yes, some no. but in general... recruiting from somewhere (there\\'s the distinction) very far away is a little sketchy (even in the interconnected model of tech (imo)) i am not drew barrymore (fire starter) my adventures with recruiters doesn\\'t relate to front end dev - btw  but, i\\'ll be glad when i complete the course (it\\'s great) and will be happy to add certs to existing stuff (don\\'t know the immediate impact... but i think it will be positive) what templating are you using? ah, classic panel back again that was an adventue adventure ecven or even ty ty @rphares  sidebar is pretty but not functional sounds interesting (who would be bored by that? pppht) got  where (next?) no clue what @rphares  (nods \"ok\") is talking about @rphares now you\\'re grabbing stuff from torrents?  (the slide has been most severe) tisk, tisk @qmikew1 glare uh, uh feign sure oh lol it\\'s funny how an avatar (which can be anything from an image of mac and cheese, to a mountain) can affect the way people perceive /talk to you -- case in point: @cerebr4l  hello new person @jbmartinez .... beware of the penguin @jbmartinez i\\'m still thinking the nun disguise is your best chance to escape mordor  i don\\'t have hard percentages of chances for success @sludge256 what kind of fcc data? (file serving convo) @nickejanssen linking the pen would probably yield the quickest answer i like pink. i like kanji nan nan totally random.... and no i don\\'t believe that ( @rphares is so darn nice that i like to give her a hard time) hello, goodbye  @nickejanssen i suppose people can rawgit it if they want .... the link should be sufficient sprouts @nickejanssen you weren\\'t kidding (that is complicated -- ) vegan salami is a heavy metal band from taiwan i don\\'t mind veggies.... but i also don\\'t mind meat especially meat that\\'s been grilled with oak sometimes bbq sauce and oak chips makes meat taste better !!! @alicejiang1  (am practicing enthusiastic hello) burger king has a veggie burger... (not half bad) ah five guys... is great  i like the peanuts in the lobby at 5 guys lobby / waiting area  i don\\'t think there\\'s one near me now (i enjoyed said food when living in/near different city) they have a place called \\'cook out\\' or something  in nc not the same but kind of tasty @rock-a  welcome @cmrandall what kind of error? @cmrandall do you have a pen of this (my guess though it\\'s local) bad for hair follicles  yeah, that\\'s what i do nan nan nan yeah oh, whoops i wish i were cool like me too nan that\\'s so wrong..... lol btw @combsco i don\\'t think you can take back tagging someone even though you delete message i do too if your choice of technologies is driven by making the acronym sound coherent that\\'s an issue (stack talk) @brianborin no hard /fast rule. it\\'s up to you... when you get to the projects you will be doing a lot of \\'doing\\' and \\'reading/viewing, skilling up\\' no prune here or gooseberries (wtf are those) i get bad title \"]\" lol the slang part of that  is interesting  (article) yeah i didn\\'t know that now i want bananas they rule not in wine though eww heya @dajust  i\\'m so done with winter no, nc. but i\\'m glad it sucks for you as well :smile:  yes politics yeah, tech people are weird... but not everybody is like milton (actually one of the few non-tech people in the movie) in the basement hacking away at code without interfacing with people (in fact, you need communication/social skills). linky the pens (pure styling theory no worky when troubleshooting) how is camperbot commenting on issues? ------> you bought your own app? how did you bungle it yeah, that\\'s an interesting idea (app) put some hot sauce in it you\\'re good to go i\\'m not an array @gitwmkovacs  i want to hear more about the stew nan nan laptop yeah, i like it you\\'re not off the hook on the stew thing apparently she made some sucky stew i had to google that. looks totally yuppie lol that\\'s actually pretty god god? good is it capped at 60? probably don\\'t want to commit to doing serious cooking a billion times a week though yeah, the one-off ingredients do end up costing more ... if you\\'re making something you haven\\'t before (or something including said ingredient) so, it sounds interesting welcome @esocomputing  @esocomputing not so much a 1:1.... there was a lot of *additional* stuff added @esocomputing i came in june or july  so, were there tar pits at that time? lol ok, ok already ... geez they linked to codecademy for basic js what kind of pudding corn? why do keep adding that **one** ingredient to everything? like all your recipes sound great.... but then there\\'s some extra ingredient that makes it weird node is fun (painful) but fun do you do backend now? angular is hard yeah but you\\'re already a senior front end dev lol is there a reason to follow you (vs. self interest)? @libanthedev  welcome @anok  face palm welcome @lynne78  see ya i\\'m slowly being turned on codepen pro not there yet.. but yeah that part is cool yeah i see a lot of pro accounts in featured  come to think of it magic lol yes that sucks why i complete things locally and paste stuff into pen (and i prefer using my own tools) i\\'ve settled on the fact that cert requirements are going to change and are open-ended (not a critique)... but this sort of mirrors reality of change ... yep they retire certs i\\'m not discouraged by the changes from a learning standpoint... but kind of makes me think of the old desktop application paradigm where companies would throw every feature into something until it became something other than its core  @sludge256 it\\'s funny though i\\'ve seen people complaining about the tribute page being too hard (can\\'t win) lol i just went down a memory lane rabbit hole with mugatu (thanks @sludge256 ) that\\'s actually something, i\\'ve wondered (the messages after completion ) where do they come from? (i get most of the references because i\\'m a gen-x(r)) what @willtravelforfun is buying a yacht? nan nan nan nan nan nan i know but you\\'ll get yacht work welcome @sidneeginger  there\\'s a university named after an abba song? nan nan my english sucks though i\\'m a native speaker i was waiting for my @abhisekp greeting ty  ty tax tax @abhisekp  @yoqu i get a lot of that (are you chinese, etc.).... my avatar is in kanji (yes, same common roots) there are (indirectly) api things in projects welcome @jeffersoncn  :sweat_drops:  ty, ty @rphares  random factoid (i didn\\'t know this as was going for some humor with @abhisekp \\'s \\'hello fellow ....\\' greeting is -- hindi is a sov language i guess it would be like learning japanese) you get embroidered mittens made by elfs if you reach 3000+ points ( you\\'d have to ask @rphares  ) now you\\'re thinking but no full coverage ok you know the question @rphares  no not sprout check.... stew check (and you should eat dinner) @yoqu thank you i will try to make it more interesting lol they liked it?

(i\\'d drop the animations (or limit ) under the skill section) again, it\\'s a tossup between \\'you don\\'t know js\\' and the free codeschool weekend for me well i don\\'t **have to** but it\\'s hard (for me at least) to digest complex topics *and* do a billion other unrelated exercises (i.e., free code weekend).... sometimes you gotta step back and focus on one thing i think that\\'s the follow-up edition @revisualize  well, yeah... but that has a sales pitch feel to it (limited time!) do, it ...do, it.... how are you not making my point again? sigh i may do it your logic is hard to argue @revisualize  @buguinha69  welcome you can actually check the specific regex if you\\'re that interested @jasondeving  no the actual regex used with camperbot although python sounds good i like its data (centric) value  if you get into top 10 you have *a chance* to win a free year  yeah right that\\'s not learning, that\\'s insane cram-o-thon like all you can eat (they know you\\'ll hurl before 8pm) nan i don\\'t want to be called nubby fingers  no no i don\\'t lie about lists how much more honest can you be to say that you should worry about sleep deprivation when cooking  night @revisualize  tony i - rocks well, not everybody is a cool as you @alicejiang1  yeah i said your by accident @buguinha69 .... don\\'t take codeschool free weekend as some sort of benchmark for your learning free/not free cramming has questionable value well their \\'free\\' weekend certainly works in terms of marketing value (it\\'s been the topic for awhile now) @buguinha69 they do now (hence marketing) yep actually, (and i will give kudos @awesomeaniruddh because he went on a js pilgrimage and came back using terms like \"enlightenment\"etc.,) i\\'m back on \\'you don\\'t know js\\' (more in depth) for weekend vs. the free weekend stinkin badges @alicejiang1 thinking back on earlier comment .... since you don\\'t *have to* what would you rather do ?

@combsco , @combsco  you mean formatting said code in gitter? explain format i want the fortran room... please help ty ty where\\'s the :blush:  yes i see a future in this sigh hmm that\\'s a bit ironic @combsco what have you done to make @rphares get to the edge of marginally snarky not here it isn\\'t lol do you know js or do you **know** js? @sketchgoddess not everybody wants to use bootstrap @sketchgoddess i don\\'t mind bootstrap, but in terms of your question \"why would you do this, when you can do this\"?... do you really want a single entity defining all design? there are other grid approaches (btw) @sketchgoddess not saying good vs. bad.....   css-tricks is pretty handy in some ways i find css harder than js  nice happy code that (usually) does what it\\'s supposed to - css on the other hand  it\\'s a good read try \\'you don\\'t know js\\' also, yes the philosophy of js is an endeavor no doubt what i don\\'t get is folks don\\'t know js but find it cool to hate on jquery (a lib).... learn some stuff then critique (you won\\'t know *how* something sucks or doesn\\'t suck without having some sort of foundation for understanding) @sketchgoddess on the spa note..... you\\'ll get *why* you need js pretty quickly @combsco how much do you spend on your nails? wait @sketchgoddess do the course that\\'s the point you have a lot of questions ,  but what questions to ask will come with actually learning the material - just sayin are you kidding, i don\\'t think there\\'s a tip big enough for some poor soul to touch my feet  you have to force yourself to learn what you don\\'t know..... if you want to move forward. it\\'s scary and can be a pita ... but that\\'s the point of learning no? sigh ok, @combsco you seem to be fixated on my nails (for whatever weird reason) what do you want to know yeah it\\'s friday... i\\'m catching up @combsco mine was \"i appreciate your **prompt** reply\"  i was like wtf and in a different state prompt this @combsco yeah i did a phone interview recently @alexgeo007  you have to make one there is no fa fcc glyph icon i made my own i read that there was a request to make an fcc icon, but don\\'t know the status (if you\\'re using native fa i don\\'t know how... but i could be late to the game) lol lol i believe you i still believe you lol meh, doesn\\'t bother me either way @combsco are you going for an analyst position making friends you are a lot of companies are spinning down physical offices (jobs and all that fun stuff)  and the extra load goes to your coworkers. they might be *slightly* sensitive right now  and might not like you photographing their yodas i think that\\'s positive i\\'m working on my @rphares tribute page i thought more a retrospective in terms of browneis or brownies as some call it wordpress kind of pushed even further @anisk1992 nothing happens  that would be the worst avatar ever no i don\\'t 100% certainty and distribution i\\'m still not blonde (nor do i wear a headset) thank god lol so, i was trying to look at the ajax call but was pulled back into gitter he^^ i don\\'t have a beard nor do i typically wear aviator sun glasses (that\\'s even too 80s for me) ok i do have a mouth though and nostriles no not even close awesome what is it @jorgon1022  @jorgon1022 are you using just vanilla js?

that\\'s only like to coke cans worth two* oh, i forgot the serving size differences but still we\\'re talking quantity of said precious (coffee) liquid i actually never considered its caffeine content nice i will have to pick your brain for your coffee expertise  @qmikew1 makes note  styro is the best tasty and takes 200 hundred years to decompose lol @lalux what\\'s the name of the exercise/challenge @devonwilson1 there\\'s a lot of stuff that probably needs tweaking (so your question may not be as simple without some prerequisite stuff).... you may want to start moving away from internal styling and put your css in its own pane (codepen). you have bootstrap as an external resource; however, there aren\\'t really an bootstrap elements (rows, columns etc.,) you may want to look at examples from/in: http://getbootstrap.com/css/ hi ty ty  where\\'s the blush i\\'m not blonde that\\'s what i want blue leds and all yeah same  though right now on just laptop... is the stream actually streaming (see chat activity but no vid) running this (twitch stream) is easier through livestreamer/vlc... now if i can find a way to access chat without browser i would be happy (note to self do some research) twitch have irc? camperbot is sentient **it** lives echo i\\'m saying qmike said, but it\\'s really me camperbot saying this: \"i\\'m sentient\" echo have a nice day. i missed something in the stream...the part about bringing all the additional languages into the fold hal bot or halibut  :fish:  @berkanan imgur blocks codepen you may want to crossorigin me it what are you talking about @qmikew1 hands @spatzerny a doughnut in hopes that his blood sugar levels stabilize  not bad yes, image now renders looks good :shipit:  what? how so, not following that\\'s pink ---> on the high end  but you said is it too purple are you talking about a bootstrap nav? https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/ go with pink do it so, @sludge256 i used livestreamer (terminal invocation is easy). not bad. if i can get an irc connection with twitch chat, i\\'d be totally happy heya @darrynwu29  @sludge256 oh yeah (thank you) now i\\'ll rock vlc side by side with hexchat @sludge256 is that what you were using today (in terms of chat) yeah, the token part i was like hmmm the popout looks better agree on \\'blocky\\' (and by inference no \\'do \\'ey\\') but http://www.sitepoint.com/delay-sleep-pause-wait/ i had to do something similar (without regard to ui) so you can emulate a wait/sleep  formatted code spam @iamalexnguyen passion for know what i don\\'t know *knowing show, the code.... show, the code..... (does chant) @qmikew1 evokes imagery of cannibals singing pre-dinner chant @bunnyvishal6 tell us a little about your code (since i\\'ve seen it x3) @bunnyvishal6 one of the things i see is that your third array (after its iterations are exhausted) will eventually equal the first array\\'s value. you have a function in there called subs, that does stuff but doesn\\'t return a value... so when it\\'s called later on (with different arguments) it really just keeps doing the same thing. (confused) @bunnyvishal6 have you tried reduce (it\\'s a tip in the instructions) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/array/reduce ??? i think you\\'re trying to implement its functionality without using it.... the only other thing, i\\'d say is that i think you\\'re trying to do a callback (maybe i\\'m misinterpreting ) but your function(s) look more side effect (doing stuff/not returning stuff) .... @bunnyvishal6 you\\'re welcome (and you\\'re forgiven for posting the code three times lol) winter sucks (i must include that once a day until winter is over) that\\'s not what you have @dylandknight (at least in this iteration of the pen) look at 106 in html pane (nested so it\\'s right below 105) you have <a> @dylandknight the underlining is an (after) effect.... but when i hover over ```about tesla ``` heading, its behavior is that of a link (i.e., the heading and the paragraph neither i think you intended to anchor)... i\\'d look at all the anchors preceding to see if you closed those @dylandknight so, in other words the takeaway is: yeah, you can change the default underlining; however, there\\'s another issue there  -if it\\'s not a link then it would not have a visited state but that should be a big clue no? (that stuff that isn\\'t an anchor is acting like an anchor) @dylandknight it\\'s in the image anchors (try as an experiment to cut (you can paste back) the four anchors associated with the four images (you will see the hover behav disappear) these two lines are the offending:\\n```\\n<a><img class=\"img-thumbnail img1\" src=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/us613809-1.png \" </a>\\n        <a><img class=\"img-thumbnail img1\" src=\"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/us1119732-0.png \" </a>\\n``` (is my guess) yw welcome @dontrish1993  ( @bunnyvishal6 :thumbsup: ) what starbucks? you say i **must** visit you you\\'re awfully demanding but okey dokey. hello i want to be a swedish  clog building artisan -- will this help? no, they make those in china now but still i want to learn and am undeterred  @sludge256 so, you jumped on the free codeschool bandwagon oh, so you **can** grab those (i thought they would have limited that) @kristinavandoren those are pretty clogs (i didn\\'t think i would hear myself saying that in any context) ugh, yeah that\\'s a lot of manual work  are you scripting said grab yeah, good thing we don\\'t do that here hmm nan i haven\\'t even logged into this free thing (codeschool weekend  nan i\\'m not going to cram, cram with codeschool  i actually like to digest things @mariejlopez gasp @danstockham i know the feeling (in general)  there\\'s a wild sludge? :+1:  get sh__t done ok, the **one** thing that annoys me is people who have the \\'whistle\\' alert sound (you know the one) @joel789456 what\\'s the pen link  [![selection_111.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/dhbp/thumb/selection_111.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/dhbp/selection_111.png) @joel789456 so, what is the issue (see some stuff but not a big deal imo)  with the way it\\'s rendering on mobile  could use full  though i like the effect @joel789456  (but to your question in mobile the relative positioning  with bootstrap is the problem --- actually @storbeck is css ninja -may want to ask him)  either way when the viewport changes it\\'s going to get skewed ^ that\\'s what i was saying however, too bad i\\'m done lol @alicejiang1  i\\'ve noticed no hello are you doing codeschool how can you miss all the pink <--- <----- i suspect that taco bell\\'s beefy frito burrito is not healthy cool @atticakes and welcome lol i get , i get it.... @alicejiang1  @zarina04 welcome and @gcg121 ,.... welcome @evaderei you know the answer deep down don\\'t you? an 80s band that completely seemed to pass me by (in the 80s) was tygers of the pang tang -- heya @akiralaine  what notebook lol or you could get suckered into a browser based service yeah, that\\'s the problem they know it\\'s sweet and charge accordingly  totally mirrors reality omg how many bricks is that (well i could count) but still probably good around the holidays  where i thought everybody was busy downloading all of codeschool\\'s free crap ^ the timing of @akiralaine \\'s post is funny lolol  @combsco what is that (avatar)? @bwandls the moth room is over there it\\'s doesn\\'t look like deadpool it looks like spiderman with a samurai pony tail i\\'m talking about @combsco \\'s avatar (scaled down) or a small pickle growing out of his head wait, i\\'m talking about an avatar yeah pretty much but i think nerds are just itching to talk about deadpool (i could have mentioned asparagus ..same result) what? asparagus? no way you can bet on it i don\\'t mind the orange and green looks good wait there\\'s orange text with a green \\'let\\'s get started button\\' oh olive not \\'green\\' like olive is not a shade of green is it? yeah the button didn\\'t i say button (forgot) oh ok.... yeah that\\'s right i like that color i\\'m not i said i like it take a compliment already sheesh lol oh, i see this makes sense now soon he\\'ll be \\'i love you guys\\' welcome @paulapivat  oooh @storbeck is it possible to create an svg (i\\'ve asked this generally before but..) say like in inkscape and be able to access its meta stuff (xml, blah, blah) and animate it with css? hmmm can i change its properties. say like i had an object that i wanted to rotate (and had features to it so not smooth like globe) it  @lawlietblack isn\\'t that 1/2 way point thing (i forgot) hang on  @lawlietblack ask in here: https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/halfwayclub (i\\'m guessing you\\'ll get a better answer) yeah i remember that you too \\'not-just alice\\' there nickname solved meh yeah he went all out there\\'s a bit of a spectrum from meh, to hating on something their stuff is well produced (high production value points -- super snazzy ) awesome @tbaotran  it is i actual see things in their stuff that they don\\'t intend directly omg welcome @thorboy666 . is there any reason my mouse is moving on its own? are you a chiropractor?  ooooh @thorboy666 that\\'s really interesting... why the coding interest?

(i.e., you have static text) @fedayn oh, i see what you mean ```full``` vs. ```edit``` no, not working ... let me look at your settings @fedayn still looking at it @fedayn i think in full view (i.e., your code works in edit vs.) you have full browser going -- i\\'m not sure about the listener (why not click https://api.jquery.com/click/)  -- but i think that has something to do with it (others may want to comment) but i don\\'t think it\\'s the settings in codepen - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/eventtarget/addeventlistener , --some indirect discussion of it as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2398099/jquery-equivalent-of-javascripts-addeventlistener-method well we\\'d be stuck with roman numerals (that didn\\'t work out so well without zero) negative numbers still break peoples\\' brains ahhhh no you suck lol @rphares  (in a nice way, bailing and all) it\\'s all too complex no, we must keep roman numerals lol @cloudbuster you can choose any person, idea, org whatever... but it looks good i don\\'t think it was coffee at any point riveting chat @combsco yes although i fear you\\'re going to change it for some reason no, blue yucky nan are you moving away from jquery @krizzu  ? oh @aigog you can use console.log() and click f12 (it may also render in the in-built console) .... but you may want to go for something like repl.it https://repl.it/languages/javascript @aigog try f12 (that\\'s the browser level console) @jp2kk2 i would add a link to (i.e., for more info about x topic).... but you\\'re conflating internal and external styling (i.e.,  putting style tags in the css pane) @jp2kk2 -- the css pane is a codepen representation of an external style sheet (like something.css) so you would make whatever class in that (css) pane (e.g., )\\n```.mygroovyclass{\\n/*some groovy stuff*/\\n}\\n```\\nand then you would reference that class on the html (pane) side like ```<div class=\"mygroovyclass\">whatever</div>```  grr gitter editing ```\\n.mygroovyclass{\\n/*some groovy stuff*/\\n}\\n``` newline f\\'s shi^ up .... but you get the picture (hopefully) eww depends do you have a scope of project description do i see cartier in there (now gone) looks like you have much to spend http://grammarist.com/spelling/spelled-spelt/ @jp2kk2 first issue you\\'re doing the same thing over and over... wouldn\\'t it be easier to put in  a class? @jp2kk2  ok, beyond that...though @adamdl first http://regexr.com/ ..... step 1 there\\'s a bunch of stuff in left pane that will help + you can mess with your pattern....

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21788187/javascript-better-way-to-modify-function-prototype (indirect) @liam345 i see a couple of things....1. you\\'re (in essence ) hard  coding the arguments (i.e., adding a,b,c,....)...instead, you probably want to look at the arguments object (link in the challenge)..2. also, it looks as though filter isn\\'t being used correctly (it takes callback)  @liam345 i don\\'t see a callback in the invocation (of/in the code you posted)..... the example in mdn might be helpful (in terms of concept... and yes, this is tough... i had a problem with it as well so don\\'t feel bad) \\n```\\nfunction isbigenough(value) {\\n  return value >= 10;\\n}\\nvar filtered = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].filter(isbigenough);\\n// filtered is [12, 130, 44]\\n``` but, this isn\\'t *the* answer.... but illustrative (i.e., applied a bit differently ) @liam345  so the wine idea went out the door, then ? that\\'s a always a nice note to get (not at all ambiguous ) lol i would have interpreted it differently  lol i got cheap a^^ powdered doughnuts from the convenience store i am going to enjoy these doughnuts (i had to suffer the dude with slippers (flipflops), sweat stained t-shirt, and really yellow \\'hawk talons\\' overlapping said slippers at the convenience store)  yeah they are sealed  yeah, let\\'s put some outriggers on that boat and get some marlin hiya @thecodejones ...welcome no, still dark..... i think i have to refresh ok, i see the new avatar now @alicejiang1 .... nice chicken chicken with stuffing coming out?  :chicken:  you just called the saint @jedpimentel very junkyard dog (classic pro wrestler) \\'esqe  (new avatar) oh, yeah... enjoy it while you can @thecodejones the program/curriculum etc., is pretty new: there are a lot of unknowns (imo); however, i think you\\'ll be better off knowledge wise with program (it\\'s pretty challenging, i haven\\'t completed it yet) unknown  some certs are valued more than others (and some not at all)..... really depends on the company/org here\\'s the thing..... you get the certs (complete all the requirements) and are qualified to work with the non-profits. this is the factor that i think is being missed (i.e., not cert(s)) alone) - you potentially get experience to add to your portfolio. never been to a code meetup. what\\'s the typical agenda for these things? yeah lol only thing i can find (in terms of common elements) there is typically a code of conduct.... but beyond that, it looks like the meetup, itself, drives the agenda? -- (so, who is running these things? the person (or persons) that post a meetup?) -- all so confusing  are there (coding) meetup rival gangs? @briancbarrow maybe you could apply the \\'hello world\\' (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) in codepen with this:\\nhttps://blog.codepen.io/2014/08/26/using-react-codepen/ -- i don\\'t know if that\\'s how you\\'re supposed to get it to run in cp  i tried adding babel too (to the hello world) couldn\\'t get it to render.... so looked at codepen\\'s blog thing on react @briancbarrow so, after you become a react ninja - you will offer pointers, right?

there\\'s stuff out there  @tyryanr but those (in general / whatever you end up with) are limited, if you have something that **you** want to build, you\\'ll be driven and get more out of it (imo) @rocksynth not following ?

(i want to use that) like the view is not just what the stylus is doing.... it\\'s showing the actual hand writing with stylus  (no the hand doesn\\'t exist on its own independent of a person) what answer do you think you\\'ll get ? (fcc of course) the best way to ensure something *doesn\\'t* work is to do a screencast of it i couldn\\'t jump out of plane i mean what if the person prepping the chute is like having a bad day or something i can see it now (me first day of skydiving) - (person prepping parachute) \"wow, this is scary\" -- back at the prepping ranch: \"that -insert expletive-! oh, yeah what was i doing? right got to prep this g- insert expletive- chute\" welcome @wleyes  ok, only one container left of the \\'bitter beans\\' (i.e., cooked a bunch of beans that turned out bitter and had to, literally, eat my own mistake) i can\\'t throw food out (makes me feel guilty) yeah totally jalapenos, garlic, onions, some pork goodness (stock that i had but it wasn\\'t bitter) something else, i forget though help us with what? camperbot really? dried beans, soaked... in crockpot no worky you want a bean note? lololol no, you got me.... i used \\'un-fresh\\' garlic no nan night fcc/mongodb/laser treatment class-mate http://www.ajinomoto-usa.com/ yeah  in my early years the name of that company was a popular rhyme nan nan yeah, it is pronounced that way but was stressed for effect omg alice cooper is looking really bad (and that\\'s saying a lot)  @dedz1990 for those whose solutions are not marked private @anthonygallina1 i\\'m thinking that\\'s what my grandmother would have looked like wearing a skull belt (alice cooper... scary thought) what s. korean guy totally not following don\\'t be a stranger @phajava \\n ok, @evaderei  still not following (the bam thing plus point up didn\\'t help @rphares ) you\\'re trying to make my head explode huh? tomorrow is not today @evaderei  @gitmazzone some people use two images one frosted one not to achieve that effect (gimp, ps) varchar? should be datetime (if you\\'re working with a relational db) you can convert datetime in queries (remember, there\\'s a difference in structure vs. returning formatting in say a report) ok, the bitter beans are beginning to taste good varchar is not a date format again, structure is abstracted in conversion functions for display didn\\'t see the original sql statement (but saw varchar and was like noooooo) lol i don\\'t think that link is long enough @anthonygallina1 i didn\\'t click link, but i\\'d say that\\'s steve vai and satriani in the background vai no matter how aged is insane (and always will be) heya @akiralaine  if there are business that do heavy cat photo application development, we will be well prepared ty, ty are you getting the most out of your (or other people\\'s) cat\\'s cuteness? - in the internet age, it\\'s important to have \\'cat cuteness\\' presence -- that\\'s why we, here, at \\'leverage-your-cat-for-profit-dev\\' strive to make your transition easy as pie.  @ryunaq \\'the background\\' or overlaid images in individual divs? yes, \\'leverage-your-cat-for-profit-dev\\'.... i just need to write a business plan (what could go wrong?) i like the contrast between @rphares \\' and @sludge256 \\'s input just what i need @ryunaq the \\'responsiveness\\' aspect has some pre-steps... if you\\'re going to use bootstrap my suggestion would be to review http://getbootstrap.com/css/ -- also, you may want to look into background-image, background-size (in your css class) @deron-rowlands nice. congrats.  nan @jedpimentel there\\'s a \\'secret\\' gitter font size called: \\'one screen, one letter\\'  close @ryunaq the question about \\'the background\\' vs. overlays in divs will make sense later though (imo) you should avoid too many pointless jquery animations (this is not where the power of jquery reveals itself (it\\'s more)) @arielleslie i\\'m going to need the lunar-color changing chart by cob. thanks heya @zersiax what\\'s shakin @zersiax more \\'fcc goodness\\' has been added lol @seansaibot i used an api however, some users opt for an array of values (or both array + api)  :metal:  that\\'s some camperbot love (note, parallel comment... haven\\'t experienced said behavior (ssl) on chrome in last login / access of challenges) @sludge256  (is it related to commit a couple of hours ago? (though looks unrelated (wiki)) k,k hey, what\\'s with the deleted messages @rphares (that\\'s my thing) one critique i have about mongo is their (whatever platform) stuff is difficult to install (although easier than popular vendor relational db equivalents ) yeah, wanted to sandbox in 15.10 or > -- there\\'s some stuff i need to tweak (although this has more to do with [upstart](http://askubuntu.com/questions/690993/mongodb-3-0-2-wont-start-after-upgrading-to-ubuntu-15-10) than mongo -- also, downloaded a version for windows 10 (just sort of a pita overall and reminds me of relational installs (so, it\\'s familiar)) @anthonygallina1 :metal:  @0x0936 :metal:  nan good timezone neutral greeting to you nan @sludge256 that reminds me (slackware comment) i\\'ve got this old netbook (with soldered mem, for all intents and purposes is really a pi with a keyboard and monitor) i\\'ve wanted to mess with (tried puppy, usb installs etc... etc.) i\\'m thinking of trying dsl on it (no, not a production box)  yeah super minimal yeah i\\'m trying to think of project for it do they dislike wifi in that building? or phone reception questions about what? are you going to answer some questions @jtlscout  @jtlscout how can i fuse a jalapeno with a potato? i want jalatato please help no, i want part potato + jalapeno.... not italian ice cream  @sludge256 i like that... but it would be pronounced \\'hal lat toe\\' and would lose the side benefit of gelato @rphares i can keep my figure even if i eat potatos @abhisekp you need to work on your \\'inner voice\\' (it\\'s being mean to you for no reason) @radascript json is the interchange format (transmitted from (in this case a quote generator api)) that you\\'d grab from. if you\\'re not using an api, it\\'s likely that you\\'d be pulling from an array (within your js code itself... not from an external text file. if you were grabbing json from somewhere like your own webserver, you\\'d be kind of making your own api) feeling better @abhisekp  ? beware double vision  omg emacs evangelist ---  although, the minimalist aspects are interesting (but no way ) evil cnn page (embedded media) i left tab open and started hearing this piano thing and was like \"geez turn down the stereo neighbor\" audio was flaking on me (using livestreamer) earlier with twitch  you get \\'best\\' or \\'worst\\' (and some other options) with livestreamer but that\\'s program flags yeah, i didn\\'t see the verbose option output just like a couple of lines of output (limited option set) arguments doesn\\'t do anything (you can\\'t act on it and only  has a length property) so, yeah... you have to convert it to an array.... but, aside from that do you see a difference in the following output:\\n```\\n[ [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 ], 2, 3 ]\\n{ \\'0\\': [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 ], \\'1\\': 2, \\'2\\': 3 }\\n``` mdn\\n> the arguments object is not an array. it is similar to an array, but does not have any array properties except length. for example, it does not have the pop method. however it can be converted to a real array:\\n\\nvar args = array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\\n @htmlnoob roll with it. the arguments object does have its uses but it\\'s kind of a weird \\'throw you for no reason\\' part of the challenge i was the same way  what no blush? i will welcome myself then welcome back!!!!  :blush:  me mine\\'s better welcome @osinfotechimphal :blush:  :deciduous_tree:  @rphares  (it came up first in sort) i have no idea the context of deciduous tree @cheie1990 you sure you have the right color in there? wait, what would i \\'just say\\'  \"aww\" to again? yeah, why not? should i go get some coffee while you\\'re typing? brb nan i have to admit i haven\\'t gone through the handouts in zip (instead have been doing the lectures/quizzes without it) - but the general approach that they\\'re using is the initial quiz answers are not graded (the homework is at the end of each week) - so, if it\\'s not a graded.. (don\\'t know if what you saw is or isn\\'t) then i\\'d assume that the lecturer is probably thinking \\'no harm no foul\\'... if it is then, yeah that\\'s a mistake; however, if a zip as been download x billion # of times, would what the fix be for that week? (probably have to change a bunch of stuff - in a short amount of time and throw everybody off)  --- @alicejiang1  yeah no doubt,  going forward .... would agree hmmm well, sure because the free course is also a path to an optional *paid* cert - so, there is some expectation of professional-level interaction (however, not making any judgments: 3rd-hand text is always a bit of wildcard lol)  my panel is all messed up <--- although, i did get to read a lot of folks telling me what my avatar means in chinese (it\\'s kanji..so in this context, japanese) - like i wouldn\\'t know that sheesh. yeah, just pick some random characters... done, done. of course, what kind of nut would pick something at random you might get \\'guano\\' as your cool kanji  nan although i\\'m thinking of changing it to an early dan ackroyd character @rphares i\\'m going to be trying to decode that now if she\\'s advertising something wouldn\\'t be helpful if people can read it? (i.e.,  the context would seem to suggest that not a lot of japanese speakers around) howdy hmm nan oh, yeah i\\'m not showing any leg i think dan ackroyd is better wait, on second thought  i should totally spoof @arielleslie \\'s (yes, she\\'ll see this) avatar with my own \\'shoes\\' shot @rphares google irwin mainway irwin mainway nan nan map is good about? no camperbot no, i actually thought the look of that akroyd character was funny as hell i also remember the bass-o-matic sketch/character yes nan wait, i\\'m totally generous  you\\'re leaving us @rphares  ? no, i mean in the context of the statement paying tribute to camperbot doesn\\'t remove you from the skynet list (when said bot apocalypse occurs ) implied questions? i totally don\\'t follow the implied question thing (this is going to drive me crazy) gasp you invoked thy poison singer well, i know who bret michaels is without googling there\\'s a clue @rphares  omg, what happened bret nan omg this means i went the official poison site (can\\'t believe i just typed that) yeah i can nan but gnr is actually my fav why, you ask....? why?  lol oh, yeah no, i think @sludge256 is suggesting that you\\'re dodging since we don\\'t know whats happening next week don\\'t know, she won\\'t tell us she\\'s being all \\'dodgy\\' and secretive  you need to make your own did they remove the shadow off those? (i recall either in gimp or ps i took that off) lol (copied as bitmap) then redid it in svg i think (have to look again) fa-fire is not the fcc icon make your own yep, i saw that too they still haven\\'t responded ok, you want to be a dev but making your own icon is too much trouble? me neither .... not as though spamming the issue for shameless +1\\'s  https://github.com/fortawesome/font-awesome/issues/6927 would be something i\\'d do ....no way yeah, i made my own too no idea yeah... that koala everywhere it\\'s a cute but vicious bear like thing eats stuff cra^^s a lot that\\'s the shadow (old) are they good eating? well no i pretty much eat only ugly animals cows chickens yeah chickens are ugly  although it\\'s subjective nan nan i\\'m a steak-and-chicken-fish-atarian \\'i had\\' twice? oh candy bar made from rose petals and formica  @goodm0urning can you link the pen can you post here @goodm0urning might get more input (and my panel is all messed up) @goodm0urning you have everything (including the nav in container) take a look at this https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/ you\\'re too nice nan nan i am the master of all things finnish ok, nvm no no, that was a totally unhelpful comment (i don\\'t know anything about finnish culture or language) wat those aren\\'t dishwasher capsules @spatzerny  no, that\\'s finish (like the finish on the glass or paint on a car) not finnish @rphares raisen bran..... yes/no raisin  fire bran would be bad nice welcome @rogicoy  welcome @datause  @liyenpermey i think the pauses in response(s) has to do with the \\'unknowns\\' in your approach (e.g., are you going to use bootstrap? are you going for parallax effect?) heya @krizzu  like what was suggested before, backgrounds to individual divs will overlap the background itself i\\'d read up on bootstrap though first their docs are pretty good no idea bless you baristas rule nooooo (and this isn\\'t for any selfish reason, no way) if all the baristas become web devs then what? i was going to say cool hair color.. (but it was the lighting)  @michajo2k3  the var outside of the function is causing the last test to fail @michajo2k3 yeah, i didn\\'t see your amended post. but recently variable scope has been added in challenges @michajo2k3 these might have been added after you started --- but yeah, the scope thing is good to know:\\n > global scope and functions\\nlocal scope and functions\\nglobal vs. local scope in functions # @combsco  wait, i was looking for the superscript gitter markup @twispi bootstrap overrides a lot of things you may or may not find some success with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20721248/best-way-to-override-bootstrap-css (ancient post but may work who knows) you can drag images into the chat window but if it\\'s code (formatted) text is better @randya you\\'re (we\\'re) encouraged to use a lot of resources.... you\\'re not going to get into super deep elements of js (with course alone); however, the course is pretty good and covers a lot of \\'stack\\' ty, ty (finally get a :blush: ) nan if your network is slow (like a coffee shop - like me) ...might want to go for the youtube vs. vimeo hd for the js questions  no emoji @khalysi  i actually saw cobol in a job posting i was, heh totally @tsampurna why is your link above the style section (that\\'s for assets (or referencing)  like css and js files)? mine either @oddissee are you trying to recreate the 90s? @jbmartinez i still haven\\'t tried doing [this](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/start-programming-swift-ubuntu/) on ubuntu but, i think @khalysi  is trying to wear us down with her swift antics lol can\\'t really run full blown stuff w/o apple hardware but looks like you can test basic language stuff in ubuntu with an opensource swift build on ubuntu @khalysi  dang i was hoping that you\\'d use your production machine as a swift *buntu incubator lol - doh, plan thwarted @jbmartinez  i could throw it in a vm but yeah, looks sort of a pita to get running i\\'m a total sucker for anything that has a *buntu build (in fact, if they open sourced the \\'common cold\\' (i\\'m thinking something else, but rhymes with jerseys) i would consider putting on a machine somewhere explain format @khalysi i primarily (have to fire up windows in vm(s) because i can\\'t avoid it) use linux... i\\'m not a huge mac fan; however, i might use one if i could throw a linux vm on it (never exclude anything -- there are some cool items for usage on a mac... that i could go for)'"

       "'hello... i heard about free code camp via lifehacker (i think: it was a feedly- feed) so, just going through the prescribed steps (hello world etc.) have a mix of different technologies would like to get into development side of things. looking for some idea on the average amount of time (yes, subjective and varies by level of commitment) day/week/etc. it takes to effectively use curriculum ok, i found the documentation (i\\'m new) on the general timelines things take etc. -have a lot of relational db (so think in terms of tables and keys) -would i have a difficult time with mongodb  (different approach nosql)? at what point does pair coding come into the picture? (am new and also a linux user)?  do some amount of bash here as well. have to sometimes unlearn white space with js with all of the various frameworks (even some being learned in course) being employed (to save time on different things) maybe it leads to a lot things \\'looking the same\\' on different pages. i\\'d like to see more variety in design as well. i think it\\'s part \\'where people expect to see things\\' (e.g., steering wheel in a car) and part standout design aspects does the sameness (not specifically bootstrap, but in general) begin to shape demand/design? i\\'ve found that compiling a list (your own + links to) of stuff helps.  a lot of where i get caught up isn\\'t  the underlying logic but not placing a ; in the right place or remembering some element name syntax that is i find geany to be pretty solid (as far as editors go). ugly, yes. i\\'d imagine if you had experience programming desktop apps, it wouldn\\'t be difficult to apply to diff web technologies edit: too i think (in addition to monospace vs. monotype) you can also put font-size and family in same declaration (i\\'m no expert) good to hear. css is more forgiving than js very true. sloppy code not only affect you, but the person (in production years down the road) affects why do you have to loop through each character vs. \"uppercasing\" the entire string?  oh, i see (not critique, just curious ) i see . @mrxinu - i haven\\'t gotten to that exercise yet the js exercises are a little quirky in the way they progress (i.e., keeping previous result from prev exercise - then asking to do/add something (when a re-write might make more sense) if you\\'re not making mistakes, you\\'re doing something wrong even if i have to use a vm, i find anything with a kde desktop helps workflow (screen edges etc.) no gig is \\'more poverty\\' inducing than gig. get one (gig) then evaluate whether it\\'s too low etc. i see a lot of dollar figures (which of course is important) thrown around, but focus on the content first (learn it (whatever \\'it\\' is ),  otherwise , it\\'s all hypothetical .  there are still a lot of ms shops around (asp.net) not an endorsement (i.e., asp.net, which for a number of reasons, sucks) are there any good resources for js project (not necessarily walking you through code) ideas? hmmm, i should add the caveat: (must be interesting to coder which is subjective lol) some good ideas. i think the key is thinking up something (i.e., a project to practice) that interests you. need really drives outcome  yes, it\\'s ancient but most applicable @mehroshh - thor or dwight yokum perhaps, (necessity comment) scrubs is (was) a great show  the administrator (or head) doc is also one of the \\'bobs\\' in office space what? i had to look that up (i.e., band after scrubs) these were seasons well after i stopped watching... that\\'s funny  i\\'ll have to pull up some of those episodes; however, the core-cast renditions of erasure and poison songs are funny as heck yeah, i started to defect midway through: can\\'t believe the show went as far as it did after that - i\\'ve been doing too many coding exercises, and am digressing into media i would have to intersperse all of the remaining scrubs episodes with my coding exercises... high commitment, but will take into consideration @tourn171  - if, there\\'s a tear jerker, well...  white noise (a think there\\'s an article in news link) works for some... if i have something that\\'s really funny in another window it totally distracts me   i saw an article about an 80-90s era actor who passed up role, thn returned geany is good (of course i say this every time i see a text editor discussion) people skills (i.e., moving up the ladder) will oddly enough, serve you well in coding too vb is kind of a curse: find myself, sometimes, translating concepts in new languages to that (lang) looking forward to the database portion of this (these) course(s) linux is great (although, completely removing win (vm) from machine still proves elusive) i jump back and forth between kde and enlightenment desktops... (just rambling) @okelano been down the xubuntu route... have a couple of those (vm). very straightforward interface  kde for a lot of gnome folks is heresy (i understand) but it\\'s pretty handy agree, terminal is the best wouldn\\'t you just adjust your evaluation condition to match the desired jump  @evaristoc, didn\\'t catch the whole comment (it was a response) ; however, got me thinking in other application/concept  @okelano , no sorry needed.. (i was saying i didn\\'t catch the whole thing) - it did get me thinking about iteration in general... you -can- iterate over low level things like strings, but maybe higher order objects are better performance wise that\\'s neat. never thought to use a visualizer tool for regex (which i\\'m always trying to improve) agree... (still am no master) when i came across regular expressions (lang /implementation -independent) many year ago,,, i was like \"wow. powerful\" is it hard to jump back and forth between \\'pure\\' javascript and jquery? is most of this (course) pretty much codecademy with an occasional waypoint video (not intended as sarcasm, just wondering if there are different resources as you progress) @clintoncampbell, i suppose that makes sense as you could view fcc as a learning framework in itself  so, i see a lot of references to bonfires.. what are they? (yes, i could search through documentation etc.) nice, thanks @jonslucas.  (for the \\'use your resources crowd\\': there\\'s also a conversational element to things) just sayin @adventurebear, am about midway through javascript...   thank you @adventurebear , have some experience in programming (and other technologies), but thought this would be good  that\\'s actually a good question @adventurebear - i think i see most of this (i.e., various technologies) as a \\'wrapper\\' to the database stuff -which is the general direction of goal  well, if you\\'re developing anything for enterprise or small organization db, is going to be in the mix -hopefully not too vague... in response to @adventurebear    would add that you would, also, be sol when somebody asks you to explain the reasoning behind your code @adventurebear , nope... i think my brain is overloaded a bit i agree with that @pwackerman ... i, also, work through it (challenges) .. the exception being simple syntax rules can\\'t you do that in html5? (since security prone flash is going away (at least that\\'s what they say) is there an html5 equivalent to timeline based animation? (that people have actually used, etc) javascript is often underestimated... as i go through the lessons, and read varies articles - it has all kinds of stuff going for it  @cloudynetwork , that\\'s exactly what i was thinking / referring... a lot of js books (at that time) presented it (lang) in oversimplified terms (not to mention the rip-off: vbscript) yes @cloudynetwork, that\\'s why noscript was such a great add-on  the new \\'blinking cursor\\' of this century... is auto-start media if you code until solution (without any \\'externals\\'-   big-salary promise, etc)  because it (any problem) bugs you... you will probably do ok regex (though i use it to a degree in shell) can be daunting in some cases, (in the js exercises) it\\'s hard to discern if it\\'s user error or the parameters of the exercise i was doing the \\'iterating over keys/value\\' exercise as well...followed the instructions etc., returned what was required... but, also researched.. and found object.keys method (thought it was interesting) if you\\'re working with a lot of data, regex (which is still seems more difficult to internalize than other things) is really powerful --- i\\'ve seen visualizer tools for regex (mentioned here before) - looks worthwhile to check out here\\'s a dumb question: can you mix \\'vanilla\\' javascript and jquery in the same page? (e.g., reference a plain .js file for some some things) nice.. ty @ngalluzzo , @mrxinu -,  so, really, a bunch of frameworks can be employed @pwackerman that\\'s kind of what i\\'m getting at (i.e., is there a potential clash in employing a lot of frameworks and classic/\\'vanilla\\' what have you javascript)   ok, library i\\'m still working my way through the js exercises, (won\\'t be tweaking libraries for awhile) swig isn\\'t defined as a function n is getting pushed to the array  (with subsequent values) but doesn\\'t have an initial declaration (have no idea just thinking through for practice) value to declaration that is it\\'s the reference not the value that i\\'m driving at.... (if they were immutable, life would suck) at what point in course should one get a codepen account (or something like it) i.e., when does it make sense? am about 70% through, the js portion (who knew that the closing brace(in my case) could be such a pain.  btw... have been enjoying your screen-casts/walk-through(s) @quincylarson    nice.  (new js curriculum) - hello hi @rasheinstein  so, as i\\'m going through js etc... i\\'m starting to get a feel for it (i think) - there seems to be some sort of implicitness in it (beyond variables)- can\\'t put my finger on it (sorry to get metaphysical) @inyono, i think that, also, speaks to the oddness (but usefulness) or grasping js\\'  (still in process) so, now i\\'m like \\'doesn\\'t make sense but looks really useful\\'  other language paradigms keep floating into process  yeah, it seems you can pass anything as an argument that was a handy tip \\'\\'\\' ``` rather put that coffee down: coffee is for coders.. (sorry, i couldn\\'t resist movie reference) have a window mach in vm (am glad it\\'s not my primary os anymore) the windows 10 upgrade seems a little sketchy...  so, is ms still offering the upgrade for free... or is the window passed  not nervous to try new windows version, but the upgrade process appears to be fraught with potential issues @zuchit, there\\'s also a path from windows 7 i think microsoft decided that windows 7 was too stable... (or not tile friendly ) go linux  kde here as well,  (also curious about desktop client) is there a distinction (plasm) plasma i.e., plasma desktop is an extension of kde(n)  no? yep, (kde4) .... i was trying to remember a handy terminal one liner for kde version but without screenedges my workflow would come to a halt depends, (kubuntu, bodhi, xubuntu...) you might have to download proprietary drivers (a lot of linux installs don\\'t necess default to this) @vniche  what distro are you currently using, again? wouldn\\'t happen to be nvidia would it? some distros, have search pages (i.e., you plug your model # in) where you can see if it might be for you or not or is supported although i\\'m reaching back in time a bit i see where you have some issues (i.e., model #) with linux  (i.e., ubuntu, mint community pages) there are linux publications that have sampler dvds (yes , antithetical to the whole web thing) why not just try a whole cr*p load of different distros? that is one of the things, about linux ... you can screw stuff up no question i really haven\\'t had a lot of problems with drivers either.... the reason that there are some issues... is because there has been historical incentive for manufactures to deal with linux no historical incentive that is backup your home directory -----  less motivated on friday afternoons yes, but much talk no worky system sorry, went away for awhile . @vniche  did you get your graphics card issue worked out  oh, that\\'s great (working system)  i think there\\'s a twitch. tv announcement/event re: new course on saturday ```//some code comment test\\n grrrr great, now i\\'m going to have to learn \\'git flavored markdown\\' https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/ i\\'m reading the faq, but don\\'t know if it works  ```//some comment\\n``` hello\\n same here, (i.e., do the exercises on my own)...   slow pace apropos friday jesus is all about coding in c  just kidding best vs. what free vs free... free vs. paid? sandboxing into linux (vm) sounds like a good idea (although i keep seeing comments like this doesn\\'t work , etc. etc) maybe a secondary system is a good idea...  beyond, compiling stuff... etc...,  security should also be a concern @exenza , agreed... sed = regex in production still is not natural (the regex patterns) to me  is pair programming a requirement? i\\'m actually glad (it\\'s not) although, to what degree do you (open question) think that somebody hiring for a developer position wants a candidate who works well on dev team vs . alone @itegman , hear you and actually agree... hello hr people usually don\\'t... however, they\\'re not making the final decisions @thedeuceii, yep.. that\\'s closer to reality   it\\'s good to have a balance of (i can do this) and (what will i reasonably be paid for it)...,  (really companies and non--profits are not heaving big barrels of money at newbies) @chocobowings , second the volunteering part  i\\'d like to learn python (but, am focused on js)  it\\'s really tempting to do do dual route learning -do although honestly, i also run into a lot of heavy file intensive stuff.... and perl keeps beckoning @jdayvie, it basically is spreading yourself too thin across multiple languages  for all of flash\\'s issues... i will be glad when there\\'s an html5 equivalent to timeline animation or maybe \\'timeline\\' is an old paradigm that will be replaced as well @royshouvik , i think i recall a linux distro that actually incorporated that into video sort of an overlay @royshouvik  that\\'s ok.  i\\'ve seen that (i believe)... the authoring aspect is very different (if we\\'re talking about the same thing) flash is still everywhere (in fact, i had to switch to a vm to watch fcc monthly - browser prompt: get flash)  @michael-krebs , not fast enough (i\\'m ready for flash to go the way of java applets) but, for all of its (flash) issue, will sort of miss layers, timelines, clips that sentence was constructed in flawless english. you shouldn\\'t have any issues with coding in it as well hi, all. anybody having any issues with fcc not tracking progress? (my case am near js completion) but is taking me back to \\'hello world\\' weird. (but thank you , @ashiantfb: that seems to get things back in order)  mac and windows, sigh... where\\'s the love for linux? google\\'s search suggestions have grown exponentially. but parsing into short syntax is helpful (e.g.,  html anchors) you can exclude terms with minus + quotes google isn\\'t the only search engine (though, you wouldn\\'t think so these days) the tip that i got (thanks again) for resetting my waypoint progress, got me looking at the entire list of stuff still to complete dang the only thing missing is yoda having me move rocks around and stuff well, face the rest of js challenge you must (yoda\\'isms theme difficult to shake)... ok, back to,...  hello hi and thank you i\\'ve found that codecademy\\'s \\'hint\\' section in each exercise is more (\\'this is part more part 2 of the excercise, read it... or you\\'ll have no clue\\')   fcc is doing a custom build js curriculum (i like that idea)  flash sucks for a lot of reasons - but apple pushed its  (impending) demise  yeah, a lot of sites are falling inline with (bye to flash) maybe i can get creative suite for a discount when flash finally kicks the byte bucket well that is the git concept (correct?) wasn\\'t the whole linux kernal done in a (prototype) version of git ? e i\\'m looking forward to the github aspect of curriculum (yes, somewhat rhetorical) have come accross it before trying to be sequential... but it\\'s tempting ty @benmcmahon100 , also... if you apt-cache search github there\\'s a cli tool there (didn\\'t run a policy directive.. so, no clue how long that package has been there)... walk before run without backend (database stuff) you really don\\'t have a site that does anything meaningful imho think of it this way... front end developer says: \\'can\\'t do that\\' or \\'can\\'t do that in x period of time\\'...if you know front end (as well) you can say that\\'s total bs and here\\'s why that\\'s not a hypothetical (really) don\\'t flame out... am trying the absorb route (not knocking other approaches) @srodman7689 i get it (the excitement aspect is showing through, no doubt.... good stuff) can\\'t \\'make\\' (browsers have different security settings) haven\\'t gotten to some of these examples; however, wouldn\\'t a standard --blah-blah works best with javascript enabled be agood idea? what\\'s the projected date of new site? (i.e., fcc now in beta) will i have to do js over (not that it\\'s a problem) i\\'m trying to figure out if ca\\'s lesson instructions are really some brilliant way to introduce user to dealing with ambiguity i noted (in the broadcast) that life hacker really bumped traffic... could be dealing with capacity but turn those back on when you\\'re done it\\'s amazing how much stuff doesn\\'t work w/o js. (just in general) @brockson007  agree yeah, it\\'s like most kung-fu masters are ok and all... but then there\\'s a few that give a bad name (hence the blocking add-ons) leave the space white space in bash is a pain i do a lot of file parsing in bash (sed mostly) script. no guru , but it\\'s much easier than (dare i say it) powershell i\\'ll take it (lol) here\\'s the thing... non-profits (many) work on pretty thin margins... even though, development might be \\'free\\' their time is not... am towards the end of (the first) js section (i think there\\'s more) still have to keep one foot in ms technologies, on some level that bugs me... the zone comes and goes... at least for me example projects are necessary (yes, yes, i know) but if it\\'s something i\\'ve created, it\\'s compelling  i think the paperclip had a name (how do i turn this off!) i remember when that came out mouse event, keyboard event you could tie functionallity to window name or it could send a shutdown signal... you wanted motivation lol oh, eah that\\'s right: clippy. you could also, use the dog animation as well....pure evil yeah but chrome store has all these things like code review... i think your invasive plugin will no pass muster (lol) yes, but microsoft already cornered the market on \\'annoying the hell out of you\\'  their new thing: mandatory updates. wtf. linux will always be primary that\\'s what a whiteboard, marker, and interviewer with common sense is for who is probably thinking the same thing.... ok, i think \\'the only thing\\' i have left for js section...is build cash register which i\\'m not building right now as my brain is looping over ca\\'s bad instructions didn\\'t see full context of comment... but make sure you know what you\\'re doing before applying update (use a select statement to test first) there\\'s a difference between displaying date (or other) formats in a select statement vs. actually changing the column attributes in a table... again, no idea of context of question (just throwing that in there) after reading through ca\\'s exercises (yes, i\\'m still on that) i question whether i\\'m barely literate test with select first (always) @raincode , just general info... with sql (i.e., to benefit in general). the main idea is this: update and delete, can affect (depending on joins etc.) pretty much everything... so, you want to use select   first to return what you expect, (because it\\'s the same thing that you\\'ll affect) sql is a nice break from the cash register thing i have to complete some of these exercises got me thinking about scope (js) how does scoping work in js? if i define a function (in it\\'s referenced in say file1) i can\\'t call/use it in other contexts? @ronstarcool , yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m bouncing back and forth... there\\'s a \\'sequence element\\' in scope take the file part out for a second.... and we\\'re talking inline i just hope the beta to live switch doesn\\'t happen like a few minutes away from completing js that would suck virtualbox is great, (still prefer it to vmware) that\\'s because of the drag files from host to guest feature (i think) greetings isn\\'t there a gitter for linux as well? looks interesting nice @jack1618 ...might install in a vm and check it out how do you like the new version of windows? (not my main os, but have a machine that i should probably upgrade) seriously? (awsomeness) i might try that (linux version)... the ms upgrade, if i commit, will likely take awhile seems like pretty positive reception (ok, sample size not scientific) , i kind of felt that way about win 7  hello all though unicorns are indeed magical, i pretty sure they have stable attendants feedly and life hacker for me (although that was a couple of weeks ago, i think) so, all the things that were \\'super-science-fiction\\' in star trek are pretty lame by what we now have (e.g., communicator vs. smart phone). i\\'m looking forward to the machine (replicator) that makes lunch doh, the holodeck... i forgot that you can eat, and be on another planet you\\'re right: 3d... is close. all the gadgets in space movies/shows look silly compared to reality. (i am however, waiting for the light saber turkey slicer ) @andreimariusb  i seriously prefer convience to kung-fu chopping turkey for sandwiches @benmcmahon100 , in a lot of ways the communicator (1st gen) was a freakin flip phone @andreimariusb  you\\'re assuming that kung-fu skills will work on a turkey. they are fast and illusive. i\\'d have to settle on eating mud and dirt wait, @benmcmahon100 , they had sliding doors in star treck...? synthetic mud and dirt are the worst 007 is totally realistic. whose to say that a guy with metal teeth couldn\\'t bite holes in cars? who\\'s yes, but there was no air pump (aquariam bubbles) for the whales in that movie and they dumped them into the future... just to save earth come to think of it, there was no scene of aquarium cleaning in that (star trek) movie saw the beta in screen-cast, i\\'m going to wait (and hope the progress that i\\'m achieving in current site isn\\'t erased) @benmcmahon100  yep, most of it seems to be in codecademy any way i think you can (or supposed to anyway, they\\'re looking for feedback (bugchecks, etc.) yeah, but having to do it again... hmmm i\\'m reading this as (you\\'ll have to do it again) lol hello is there a malfunction or is it this slow wow, suspense so, in the intervening silence... i decided to google javascript error handling (my progress in course hasn\\'t touched on this).. i was like \\'where\\'s the error handling\\'? if you are regexing large strings (that have natural spaces like a sentence) that could be problematic down the road still on js error handling... looks complicated (from what i\\'ve read so far) @vincepandolfo , yes... however, i\\'m seeing ajax ... and specific libraries and other stuff thrown in totally i\\'m at the latter part of js (maybe i\\'ll knock it out tonight) i know i\\'ve said it before; however, js is pretty bad a**. (and totally underestimated) i have this book (got it at sale or something) that has js section (it mentions windows 95 on cover ) it\\'s interesting comparing the difference between (js) then and now that\\'s pretty neat (it\\'s scaled down) oh, so .png(s) are scaled to a predetermined size? in this (gitter)? if you\\'re doing runtimes, you may need to choose other (language(s) not mentioned in a or b) i have to get used to the prepending screen name to comments. it so un-natural language wise. it\\'s like saying \"bob pass me the pen, bob-thank you for pen\" etc. do your credentials (i.e., those that work in production site) work in beta? (i.e., can i login with what i\\'ve got?) ok, is that good or bad? the holy cr** part that is i saw part of it on screen-cast... i\\'d like to check it out. @quincylarson, is it (relatively) safe to login with existing credentials? (yes, beta, i know but somewhat cautious)  i\\'ll have to check the site out... still don\\'t know but will figure it out. i imagine @quincylarson is mobbed like pre-1978 elvis when he comes in to room gimp and gradient is all i need c++ wants his records back oh, basic... the nights of green screen and the commands at the bottom thumbing through the ibm binder that was great but now ibm is all about linux (why i have a soft spot) and serious (serious) servers @vincepandolfo , competitive programming? sounds interesting yeah, i would; however, i can go a day without \"your coding skills are weak\" or \"guess how many soldering points are on your board, do you know, huh?\" @vincepandolfo that part sounds good (practice) i would guess (again, guess i have no clue) not since different sequence, different stuff @vincepandolfo , that\\'s the part i like (in general) when i\\'m feeling over-confident, i\\'m knocked down (in a good strive for learning way) pretty quickly @claytongentry , i still have to login to it  @vincepandolfo , it the area of language(s) , coding... cs what have you, there\\'s always something to learn (or different approach) there\\'s no summit glad for linux. stupid windows upgrade...  @benmcmahon100  looking for the elusive upgrade icon. maybe the iso download will go sooner. reason #450 windows sucks  smoother yeah, linux is my os; however, i have to switch back and forth between vms to do stuff (can\\'t completely disengage windows ) hey, neat trick: i saw (in real time) you correct your spelling your i would imagine oem accounts for large majority (i.e., meets those parameters) a lot of the exercises seem to have variable declaration within loops.. is this a js thing? isn\\'t that bad practice (no sarcasm, just curious)  zombies don\\'t need stinking language skills (lol) well, you can pretty much some up any zombie dialog as a variant of: \"they\\'re zombies\", \"it was a science experiment\", \"oh, cr*p lookout\" yes, there\\'s a community angle to it (i.e., fcc) which i think may be a good thing well, you need to work through your challenges (exercises, etc.) the notifications in this app (gitter) could use a little work (don\\'t need to know of a mention that happened in the 20th century)  can bonfires be done solo? @misterrorypond , yeah that would (also) be my preferred method how do you feel about your progress (yes, open ended) i love stack overflow (yes, as well as 5 billion other people) well, at least the windows .iso seems smaller than in the past please twitch.tv go to html5 already what\\'s the difference between code tags and ``` in this (gitter) app oh, ok... i thought there was something new... i think you were going for a \\'foo\\' like reference to concept looks like the 2nd css class is invalid (at least by the editor highlighter)  nm put it in another editor .. highlights correctly i was going by the gitter highlighting... however, (more correctly) i use geany or notepad++ in wine backtick somebody mentioned (previsously) that you can drag an image over (haven\\'t tried it) @arielleslie , @okelano yep, somebody asked how to pull image over into (gitter) ```\\n<!-- some test comment -->\\nvar code = \"formatted\";\\n``` is the variable (code) supposed to display?\\n  hello here\\'s something i just learned the hard way: if you have code by all measure should work, but fails it might be that you need to refresh page. sheesh, i want all those minutes of my life back  codecademy based exercises that is a total (what you said) lol concentrate on the coding aspect first (i.e., learning it) then, post (to whatever, peers etc.) for review if it\\'s an enterprise level application (and your concerns are valid, depending on industry ) don\\'t deploy based on stuff you\\'ve gathered from  around the web... work with dedicated security professionals. what are the advantages of the gitter app vs. browser? (i\\'ve run both, no apparent advantage... am i missing something?) ah, tab-anti clutter if they even bother calling you in for an interview, that means you\\'re ahead of a lot of other people always be prepared for the follow-up question don\\'t try to memorize, understand. (you may need to elaborate with examples) hello ty... i\\'ve been working on curriculum for a couple of weeks.  partial newb vs. complete good attitude to have (if you\\'re an expert in everything, you\\'re probably not growing) either that or you become the primary resource nowhere that (i.e., 800 hrs) just at end of js (can see the light, almost) one problem is there is no else that would be true if the argument were valid 1st argument so, it never returns true or false (you\\'re technically correct, if everything is perfect ) what would be the point of returning true outside the loop? wouldn\\'t that negate the results of looping over the string? yeah but it doesn\\'t evaluate to either true or false, it returns a string oh, cache you\\'re such a pain you\\'re correct: it\\'s not returning a string, i\\'ve been burned on cache... (my new approach: reset everything 50 times) depends on what you bring to the table (experience, projects) -- no cache error here the one thing (well, many) i look forward to after js, is getting back to fcc\\'s more homegrown instruction. (codecademy, has some issues with explanation and setup) there\\'s a lot of implied stuff in ca\\'s instructions (i\\'m like \"where are you getting this?\") @arielleslie yep, it\\'s good for its repetition (which is needed) i actually \"came back\" to codecademy (by way of fcc) so, looked at a synopsis of udacity. interesting concept. has sort of a technician aspect (as if say ford or nissan where doing the training for their specific needs) @dshgna, well i guess i\\'ll have to look into it (i\\'m mean if it\\'s mandatory and all) lol  oh, mozilla is great... the webide is kind of fun to run things in (although reference are limited in the project scope) @dshgna  got that. i was extending my comments to include mozilla developer (in general) and the  tools available in ff (both great) failure is built-in (debugging, error handling, etc) to programming.  it\\'s not a loaded term. are the people who are near, the non-profit finish line (so, to speak)? there can you fine-tune directory access (i wouldn\\'t want application (pairing or otherwise) to be able to traverse)? hello, again ending part of js is going slow... (not difficult but monotonous)  @raultsc , i\\'m glad i\\'m not the only one who feels that way are there any more codecademy things after js? (i.e., happy learning... then surprise, more codecademy)4 @raincode i heard somebody mention udacity earlier... @nathandim, i think you mean \\'head wet\\' (as codecademy invokes desire for head in toilet)  i have to stop harping on codecademy if you already have skills, why not skip to volunteering opportunities? (i.e., there\\'s a learning element in this (program) paradigm). this is to say, there are all kinds of opportunities out there so, i use geany (and to a lessor extent, notepad++ in wine)... i see sublime has an evaluation period...  any thoughts on this editor (have seen it mentioned a few times here) ? (is it worth the $70.00 (u.s. bucks)?  i can deal with nag-screens (with full functionallity) maybe will give it a try the demo page\\'s depiction of the auto-complete features looked really interesting is github integration a deal-breaker for editors? (geany works great for what it is) that makes sense (i.e., the more \\'production code\\' then, the greater need for git integ) @terabyte , i have to agree.... the whole scm thing is new to me (though wasn\\'t just hatched out of turnip truck recently) there are cli packages for git (at least in vanilla \\'buntu\\' distros) sounds like it\\'s a more involved concept (or broad, like \\'project management\\') i find git (or whatever alternative) more intimidating than language(s)  that\\'s the thing, i think i lean more in the direction of what @terabyte is conveying (at the conceptual level) @arielleslie so your comfort level has grown (i.e., with git)? @thiagoferreir4, @arielleslie ty... i\\'ll read-up on git (conceptually) and commands.   wow. i\\'m all \\'git - upped\\' - will digest... well, 20/30 of final js section (and its mocking me every step of the way) it\\'s js lack of (but crafty use) explicit datatypes is interesting is there a colon where a decimal should be? (not kidding, i actually have to use a zoom app to see) if <= isn\\'t used , there\\'s a 0.01 gap in first condition vs <  a bit tangential but, does operator precedence affect comparison (in equation, of course.... but saw an example where lower number was last) i think (well suspect) that they do matter... @arielleslie.  my guess is there\\'s a performance issue if used improperly   i think lucas was making an indirect political statement when he wrote that for obi-wan i\\'m pretty sure the guy they got to play (pre) darth vader did not pick up on the irony (lol) well,  it was supposed to end with the ewoks - but there is another (at least that\\'s what all the hype is about)... so, consistent with \\'forward looking\\' seeing the x-wings flying over water... pretty much cemented it for me won\\'t give you the answer; however, think \\'overlap\\' and how would you detect? or the crashed imperial cruisers in sand i\\'d have to replay trailer ....  how would darth vader made it off the the 2nd death star without life support (helmet) and luke not mentioning to leia \"hey,  by the way\"  make and let\\'s not forget vader\\'s halo (you standing astride of yoda and obi-wan) waving at luke know although they did find a way to bring back ellen ripley (by cloning) in aliens - but,. i agree, luke is more than likely talking to his son ah cloning - not just for sheep, but now you can resurrect any character to keep a movie franchise going lol  slims pickens is now back (by virtue of cloning) to do dr. strangelove ii the cloning thing only came in the prequels (mirroring advancements in popular culture and science)... i wouldn\\'t be surprised if there\\'s some sort of reference to an imperial internet provider in the new movie yeah it is cannon (the books i think there\\'s some sort of \\'clear story line\\' with... first).  without googling, my guess is lucas wasn\\'t pulling anything in parallel with books (i.e., they did not exist in the 70\\'s) just don\\'t get sidetracked with star wars you\\'ll be ok i completed this (am at the latter part of js). i would go directly to the exercise to get a clean summary (or shell)... and work from there. again, two things can exist at the same time (hint) codeademy still taunting me at 97% js completion i\\'m like right at the verge of completing, and it\\'s as though they got tired of writing the course at the end (ca).   they being codecademy so, i can read the course map and all... but for those of you who have completed js, is the stuff after (immediately or somewhat) a break from the monotonous aspects?  agree (i.e., memorization). syntax (brace here, semicolon there) should never derail your learning if you know the concepts (although it can be a serious pita no doubt) serious specs @imdwit .  hopefully atom isn\\'t adopting windows or adobe\\'s approach to software (aka.. build more eat more) i could swear that i\\'ve seen ruby on bookshelves of stores going back many years i agree... jumping back and forth chasing languages without being proficient (pick one at least) isn\\'t the best way to go linux and mac are *nix like... but, linux offers more freedom imo are there new features in gitter (like just deployed )  ? i find js is underestimated an interesting read is to look at development job ads, there seems to be a prevailing \\'high-level this, that\\' - in favor of certain languages (perhaps not based on utility, but rather on inertia) i see the tea pot example a lot. what section is this? (haven\\'t gotten there yet)  oh, ok. i think the bonfire things is nearing \\'bonfire thing is nearing\\' that is. (wasn\\'t going for pirate inflection)  does split actually parse into an array (w3 mentions this)? like an actual array with index? or just a string (sans the deliminator) that\\'s interesting... you get fine control of the elements of the parsed string i sometimes wonder if this is some type of turing test the refresh thing is funny... in codecademy, i had working code that refused to pass (yep, it was: (wait for it...) cache) you can copy to clipboard, refresh then paste back will save you a lot of heartache is there like a graph of  conversation activity along a timeline (you know where i can find the arc) @duttakapil, were you an earlier adopter of fcc? @duttakapil nice.  that\\'s how i was with codecademy , left came back (by fcc proxy ) that\\'s not encouraging (as i\\'m right at the end of (yes, i shall harp again) of the codecademy section)  i would imagine (by days launched + users added (and growing) that there\\'s not a huge percentage  of folks near the end (completion). i.e, this is all a growing process what are the most enjoyable sections of curriculum (yes, highly subjective)? i always wondered what saints do in their free time (coding of course, the answer was so obvious lol) i think you\\'d have to overwrite the element (i.e., construct a different string)... but not sure oh, yeah i still have to do the windows 10 thing ( in vm) - surprise, surprise update process not smooth what\\'s a pomodoras?  seriously oh, so you\\'d have to do it in off hours and while not driving is it an actual word? doesn\\'t seem to translate into anything i think you\\'re right. i\\'ve seen it on a can.... so, we\\'re tomatoes when engaging in coding challenges ?   i\\'ve been doing the curriculum for a couple of weeks.. and i still feel awkward (i\\'m talking about pasta sauce ingredients after all) don\\'t worry about it  alright, i\\'m friggin two questions away from completing js (been like within four questions for the last two days)... what the...? lol i wouldn\\'t let regex derail you. are you trying to move away from database (which for, me is in my comfort zone) to front end development? @shannonfears , not a bad thing to have in your overall knowledge base -  @shannonfears  don\\'t worry...,  a lot of this can be challenging (i\\'m at a 98% roadblock) i haven\\'t gotten to the regex parts (of this curriculum) however, use it in bash scripts. it is daunting  seems counter-intuitive wouldn\\'t (in a non-programming construct) manager inherit from employee?  i think the friday lag has set in (for some people it might be next thursday or yesterday) can\\'t you shortcut by comparing two arrays (without iterating through each element)? (just wondering, ) nm, stackoverflow has a neat post on comparing arrays (although looks complicated) are there libraries (of the js flavor) that have \\'functions\\' that can do simple things like comparing objects without having to interate? iterate that is @dueldrawer8  yeah need one more at the end brace that is  is electronica good for overcoming js blocks? i just finished the js course (serious pita). so, not really super important in comparison to the geopolitical vein today...  but, i\\'m glad. ty @biancamihai. so, now it\\'s regex. great.  ty @jdayvie  nooo, not \\'better\\' lol one thing (among many) that throws me is chaining methods (with  functions). why don\\'t i have to close each function with ; ?  (yes - , - is the separator) the \\'rules\\' change when occurring  in the object, i think. i see what you\\'re saying @ninjatron  oh, ok i think i see the difference here.  you\\'re showing a literal chain where (as it implies) you\\'re feeding action/result ->, action/result -> action/result ->.  i think my use of \\'chaining\\' did not fit what i was asking (my mistake). i was refering to methods in objects (that may appear sequentially but do not necessarily act upon each other)that are functions, that don\\'t require a semi-colon terminator. @ninjatron , there are things that just don\\'t make sense. i think (it seems as i go along) that you have to be comfortable with some amount of ambiguity. yep, got nodejs (from repository) and integrated (at project level) with sublime (something i\\'m trying out, as geany & notepad++ are my go tos) you too would agree with @jhealy86 : a lot of it depends on what your needs are. it\\'s not uncommon to have different editors open at the same time  the cash register exercise really was a pain i look at codecademy with a silver lining: it\\'s an (unintentional) reflection of real-world challenges  hello aren\\'t the html elements stored in the larger framework @thiagoferreir4 , you\\'ll probably, also, pickup stuff from other developers in your role (congrats) i\\'ve got things to do... i\\'m thinking regex isn\\'t a good multitasking lesson @wundertunge , codecademy has a lot of those. (in fact, there are things that are carried over for no apparent reason (e.g., return statement) from lesson, to lesson equality and type vs.  @thiagoferreir4 , i imagine that you\\'ll aquire knowledge one of two ways: 1. somebody will say hey, you should do it this way.... or-- 2. hey, that\\'s super annoying, dude. do it this way (either way you\\'ll learn lol)  are there any codecademy lessons after js?  @michael-krebs , i was trying not to go there (because i can\\'t mention codecademy without giving it fair amount of criticism - ok, they suck) lol coding does seem to impart certain dislike for punctuation  the } is mine what\\'s that? good thing there\\'s not a cheddar breed @mhelmetag , yes i did it (i.e., set a cheese joke in motion) it will slow down at js first one thing to keep in mind: a lot of the examples (and this is changing by virtue of the beta site) seem to be drawing from a lot of disparate resources (websites etc.). each has its/their own idiosyncrasies i was on cheese, before i\\'m going to comment just so i can attempt to scroll lady gaga out of my field of view @michael-krebs ! that is f- awsome i would use the whole word (however i won\\'t) just because that\\'s great ok, back to expand i completed js today; however, being able to collapse is so much more significant  (ok, i\\'m just kidding - but good tip thank you) and bash if you want to go in depth (no pun intended) use hex colors w3 has a good reference. but for purposes of exercise, \\'orange\\' would probably suffice. sounds like the code is wrong great. i am not re-doing js beta/no beta lol ok, as long as it\\'s not codecademy.  where \\'you should know what we mean, even though we neither implied or stated it, reigns\\' hey, the collapse thing isn\\'t working that raises a good question: what kind of limits (which i hope there are, as i love my machine) are there on stuff running in gitter @thiagoferreir4  yeah, it\\'s a neat tip that @michael-krebs mentioned earlier. if a post (like a long piece of code) is cramming your window up.. you \\'collapse it\\' /collapse  code doesn\\'t limit itself to just your browser @thiagoferreir4 , no, no... i would never actually try to collapse your pen example. i was just talking about all the other stuff (ok, i\\'m totally lying: tried to collapse pen, didn\\'t work) lol if you\\'re running windows 95, please install linux @thiagoferreir4 , windows 95 was still running over dos, in its \\'heyday\\'.   dos games were great.  i think i recall reading that @alc1982 -- wasn\\'t there a bunch of litigation that kept it from rolling out? i can\\'t remember the dos game, but it had something to do with the original developer selling rights to a religious organization (that essentially sat on the patent) then he couldn\\'t release any variant of the game...   but now - it is being reintroduced so this was in the early 1980s? oh, ok... there was a lot of difference in late 80\\'s/early 90\\'s - vs mid early 80\\'s -- average phone now , could probably run more than 500 comparable pcs of that time (500 might be on the high side... or not , but you get the idea) which by way of long loop around....i don\\'t remember the cats lol possible, though i remember nintendo was becoming more and more popular (yet there were also, pc games) 5.0 wait was it 6.0? i do remember those (disks) if you know wordstar you know early computing hello, it\\'s possible to love regex and be intimidated by it (use it in in scripts, still is a challenge) i think the pace (here) is competing with my battery indicator nope, just saw a % drop. indicator wins. happy coding/regex\\'ng  hi coders i thought bo staff skills was working with stinky developers do a lot of people have actual portfolios of work (here)? there\\'s the knowledge vs experience thing in terms of learning new technologies  how do potential employers evaluate bootcamp experience? @miguelc1221 i\\'ve seen that. i\\'m not completely sold on them  @imdwit , i guess that could add a certain incentive, (i.e., we\\'ve parted with (n) employer who needs (x) talent)... still partnered that is. @imdwit , that\\'s the true test. seriously, when you\\'re (i.e., recruiters, employers) offering high salary... it isn\\'t just magic unicorns and popcorn..., they want (and should) to see concrete examples that you\\'re qualified. @imdwit , i hope you get it. i think if you really love to code/develop you\\'ll be ok.  i\\'m just focused on completing the course... i look at as a means to augment my other it skills. - i see the potential; however,  i know that benefits to anything come with time and hard work. have you finished the fcc course? that\\'s pretty subjective (editor) @cobunny , taking courses (any but with general direction of what your want) might help with the foundational understanding to say : \"ok, this is what i need to take next\" (works for me any way) @cobunny , there\\'s always the risk of \"completely wasting your time\" with any course/endeavor but if you don\\'t commit (to one or more courses), you have a 100% chance of not achieving what you want ok, i\\'ve been so philosophical i could barf. any way, anybody have any good recommendations for regex (i use it to some extent, but have not mastered it) @cobunny, i understand. i think you just want to maximize your investment in time (because let\\'s face it, time can be more valuable than money)... nothing wrong with that..  anybody regex? -- good resources? ty @jbmartinez ...  even without the js component, regex (i\\'ve used it with sed) is wicked powerful tool howdy @thiagovandieten ty for that. i see a lot of online \\'type as you go highlighting\\' (which i think is really neat)... i wonder if there\\'s a linux package (or add-on to editor) that you can enter pattern and see as you type @thiagovandieten , yeah most do (notepad++ , and i think sublime) it will \\'find\\' based on pattern, but i was thinking \\'find as you\\'re typing) @sigshane got bluefish it\\'s good for the html bits although you can edit js and other stuff (even though i\\'m trying out sublime, i really am partial to geany) geany rules although geany is really a pita in terms of user defined languages, (adding and such) @sigshane , there are a lot of people who swear by it (vim), i\\'m not sure for editing, i\\'m willing to commit to vim\\'s requirements (learning curve)  it\\'s the utilities that make linux... they are so focused (i.e., do one thing well) and \\'chainable\\' or do one thing | take from that | then do this... i think pacing yourself is key... if you get hung up on time taken (this is a problem i had with codecademy the first go round), you end up getting frustrated np @blueaccords  the projects will reveal themselves as you learn (at least that\\'s what the yoda like part things would suggest to me)  hello, again maybe it\\'s because mozilla has express roots in js (historically, at least taking the political aspects out) even if you don\\'t apply it (i\\'m on the regex section too) to \\'web-centric\\' stuff it (regex) is language agnostic and very useful.  i\\'m still reading up on git (although got sidetracked with regex). it would seem that part of version control aspect is what can be included upstream (i.e., there\\'s got to be some sort of vetting aspect to projects) sometimes i get playback errors, but chrome seems to handle those well. i think the video aspect (fcc ) is hosted from a service @jonatan-b , it might be opera itself, there are a lot of hits with video playback issues so, looked at the page source on waypoints... it\\'s vimeo this might be helpful https://vimeo.com/help/faq/watching-videos/playback-issues codecademy is frustrating to no end.  they may (or may not depending on your perspective) have commend of the code. relating the concepts is not their (codecademy) forte  but isn\\'t that in essence hosting a website (i.e., making a page project) from git (would that even work even if it\\'s limited to learning scale etc.)  @turroger it\\'s my understanding that you\\'re not required to pair i think there\\'s a seinfeld episode of do the opposite whatever fits your learning style, go with it.  there are a lot of helpful folks, here. sometimes i see some great nuggets of knowledge scroll by (along with the typical \\'how much money will i make\\'?  \\'how long will it take\\' etc. questions) i don\\'t know for me... project wise, it\\'s like this: high-level description, figure out the technologies to achieve.  non-applied stuff (even if it\\'s a test example) is really difficult to get through (at times) you can run html locally (i.e., not a website per se) all you need is a text editor and a browser (in its simplest form that is) notepad no. use an actual editor geany, sublime, etc. (notpad++) if you\\'re like exceptionally brilliant use notepad (i\\'m just kidding you can use notepad if you like) notepad won\\'t highlight the (respective( syntax (html, js, css... et al) . it\\'s easier to see what you\\'re doing (as well as being able to execute code (for other higher level projects/code) i had to laugh at the avatar thing everybody feels stupid with the \\'hello world\\' thing. it\\'s ok (lol) me either, i think i used to variant like \\'they made me do this\\'  to = some,  (can\\'t even choose correct word in sentence) so what\\'s plug dj? oh, i see...i\\'ll have to check it out. i can\\'t code with music eurodance, is great (why did it have to go) i think all routers need reset (too much for my taste) from time to time classic rock stations (in us) tend to play too much boston or kansas @jbmartinez admitting you like kansas is the first step in recovery lol (i\\'m just kidding of course) i went through the whole classic rock thing (as well as 80/90s metal)...   bring out the gimp (linux) sorry, couldn\\'t resist the pulp fiction reference although they were not talking about an open source image editor rush really became much tighter in late 80\\'s 90\\'s their stuff (fly by night , farewell to kings etc. ) was good too i never got into phil collins or bob dylan 2112 great album cover @danielnora i agree, he was more adult contemporary (even at that time) i was listening to iron maiden, and run dmc (yeah weird mix) so, i wasn\\'t in the \\'phil collins\\' zone all this phil collins talk reminds me of the office space scene (michael bolten reference) however you spell it no we weren\\'t. we were talking about phil collins. please, please change the topic (lol) a little off topic (the whole font thing got me thinking) but for svg , inkscape is great. however, it exports in all kinds of formats -so, have been using it for non-svg stuff as well.  -however power surge. was wondering why comments were so slow my wtf/min rate has actually increased oh, no paradox infinite loop crashing now..lol what\\'s essentially contained (at least my take) is wtf (like ok) and wtf... when one has to go back and fix something somebody else, has written. you stuff like not documenting intent , basic comments etc i haven\\'t gotten that far, but pair-programming (in terms of effectiveness) is subjective (i.e., really depends on your work style) are you posting valid fields (and not the button reference itself) i don\\'t know, php isn\\'t my forte i have to use (even though linux is my goto) a lot of ms.  the php vs. asp thing just came up in my mind... @danielnora that sounds like a neat project. (are you talking about the \\'unity\\' that forced me to switch to kde or xfce)  oh, there\\'s a unity for game development (wow,it\\'s a multi-platform framework) i\\'m not big into gaming development, but the unity tutorials look interesting, (just on first glance) just be prepared for js (in codecademy). the instructions are really bad. so, if you get frustrated... it\\'s highly likely \\'it\\'s not you\\' just have to work through it. but on the upside, i think fcc is doing a homegrown version of js @ashiantfb, yeah i\\'m anxious to try it out (although it will suck that i have to re-do (i think) js) welcome back @danielnora, i actually gave the unity website a look.  looks interesting (even if i\\'m not a gaming developer) @jonathanmusso , does it run in some sort of virtual runtime (like dare i say java)? where\\'s the love for linux  yeah, the js reference caught my attention because it\\'s been alluded to that you can use it outside of the confines of browser (yes, there are other things like actionscript from the dawn of time) i think it\\'s the compiled code paradigm, that hinders my full understanding of the newer js applications (literally) oh, the darn cash register yeah, that was fun.  that\\'s good to hear @ashiantfb , wait what? the beta will eventually be production. so, doesn\\'t that argue that i would need to redo? (at least it\\'s not codecademy) @ashiantfb , yeah that\\'s true. proprietary software is a crutch. and the worst part, is when the technology is replaced. life sucks. definitely support learning the fundamentals  i saw an article on beef brisket, use some tuna cans and liquid smoke to cook the chuck eye drag and drop (i.e, as a general construct) is useful where programming basic foundational stuff would be insane... but one can also becoming overly dependent (so, can see both sides) it\\'s what\\'s for dinner there was that and the egg campaign of the mid 90\\'s both sides are valid. from a non-gaming standpoint (and i\\'m a linux user and advocate). there is still demand for ms based technologies (although even they are even begining to embrace open source (out of shear survival) -- although, on the database side of things, ms is not too shabby  i\\'m supposed to be all about lamp stack (embracing linux) but there\\'s more than mysql i started using linux when a vista machine crapped out on me.... this was, of course, a long time ago. i was like wow, this is pretty cool @panamacitypc, linux has some disparate elements (e.g., when there\\'s a package that requires dependencies, from other desktops (and everything looks like, well, cr*p) - but it doesn\\'t require to by into an ecosystem (apple i\\'m talking about you) for everything    that would be \\'buy\\' vs. \\'by\\' nope, not even close (i.e., close to finishing) the html css, near beginning of the course is to sort of ease learner in. if it started with js, (especially codecademy) that would be more, um, problematic   there\\'s a bootstrap section if you do, you want to take care of that before presenting to a potential employer/client. (kind of like misspelling your name on resume)  what, you don\\'t like having cats take up 1/3 of your screen (pure blasphemy)  i\\'m up-voting more cats in all exercises and so close to what most people seek in web development: pages about cats @zhifuge  ty nothing like kanji and a bit of gradient it\\'s supposed to mean serenity  i was going to put something like serenity through code (however, images don\\'t scale well) @zhifuge , that\\'s also, applicable... i think there\\'s a difference between the root (chinese) language   and japanese (in terms of characters) -- i\\'m no linguist  what they stole my idea! (seriously i didn\\'t even know there was a movie) lame, it\\'s like i re-invented the wheel. \"hey, i got this cool round thing that you can put stuff on... wait, what...oh, you have that already\"? now i will have to look up kanji for popular internet cat memes i recall there where very limited jquery  (like what\\'s the point) waypoints before the js good luck fortran betamax should have won out  but i digress get used to the term \\'legacy\\' because you\\'ll find that a lot of old software does in fact live in production  so, if you have to interface a web app etc. this is good to know. this is in edition to providing an escape mechanism for older browsers (e.g., your browser doesn\\'t support blah blah)  i think this is the most \\'talkative\\' (aka key cranking) i\\'ve been there are good times to converse etc. some days i swear there\\'s mostly ai \\'beings\\' about especially cats. they are the future all this web and programming stuff: wrong. it\\'s cats for every new coder there are two things to learn: 1. it\\'s cats 2. see 1. when you transition to knowing something, you figure out how much you don\\'t know i\\'m pretty much into the beginning portions of curriculum,  (though draw from other technologies /experience) you don\\'t get muscle memory unless you\\'re doing production work. (i.e., it\\'s a slog (for me anyway) not sure i follow depends.  you may work with things (and may even be proficient) but the light bulb of actually getting it may come later.  a good example is regex (which i\\'m at/working on now) i\\'ve used it in bash etc., but i don\\'t automatically see patterns (it\\'s a pain, but powerful tool without a doubt) so, the light bulb (aside from seeing its utility) of \\'getting it at an intuitive level\\' isn\\'t there yet @danielnora - see ya. (and remember the future is cats) lol page unresponsive ... that was odd @saintpeter , that totally reminded me of the guy from dead or alive (not exactly a great image before sleep) depends on application. if you\\'re talking about declaring a string in js... somewhat, but if in say a shell script, then you can only wrap certain commands with an \\' vs \"... there are probably a lot more that others can comment.... also, in t-sql you would wrap in \\' js is weird. i\\'ve found this as i\\'m going along, the function as variable thing throws me when thinking in other constructs a lot of this stuff is good resource, but take it in stride... manage expectations. there\\'s some amount (i see it reflected in comments) that you\\'re going to have barrels of money and be master programmer all in a week (ok that\\'s a bit of a stretch) but ...   who cares, you\\'re learning for free right?  there\\'s like 17,000 and growing members... that\\'s a pretty big base to non-profit ratio @rags4developer , i\\'m not being negative, (to the contrary) ... but just saying that there\\'s a healthy amount of \\'expectation management\\' that goes along with things. i even single quote in natural language. that\\'s pretty bad hello (fellow) nerds i think the \\'test out\\' is completing the lesson (sucks i know) although the tracking/streak thing for the first parts of curriculum are codecademy based. so, if you know the material already, you can technically skip html and css, are very quick... just do it, and move on (probably best way to answer)  it shouldn\\'t make a difference, (i.e., scenario you\\'ve complete lessons (n)) and when you click link in waypoint you\\'re taken to completed lesson, great)... however, codecademy has all kinds of issues. if you\\'re talking html , css.... make your life easier, just re-do if you encounter issues np @platypusrex  coffee can\\'t be overrated as a prime ingridient to solving most things variables named a, b, c, aa, bb, cc, are a pain  @lightwaves , i\\'m going to use that (lol) btw @terabyte , i took your advice on git resources.... (now i just need to read)  the whole git linux connection (historically) is very much on my wavelength wow... so, with this api, you can get around same origin policy ok, other than @terabyte  (who obviously is versed in this) are folks actually utilizing atlassian? have to take a look, is it (atlassian) included in curriculum, or did i stumble into an advanced class? well, i\\'ll put atlassian on the reading list i suppose. yeah but i said that as well (i.e., git) lol you should retain comments (imho) as long as they\\'re  labled correctly. it helps show the progression in logic. (which can be helpful later for others) @terabyte , oh... i see - interesting.  the cross domain aspect (which i\\'m assuming is available in other non) is what i thought was interesting @zeffii , i get it. this is curriculum, aimed at front-end web dev (so, everything is assumed that we\\'re using git or or version controls etc.)... i\\'m talking more broadly where a version control may not be in effect @djio2015 , thank you for the slice comment (i\\'m assuming misdirected lol) in a large shop what @terabyte and @dmcgill50 , is certainly true. i am not anywhere near an environment where this is the case. i will say that version control is relative (at least in the near past) development takes a lot of different forms as well. so, it could be apples to oranges i see your (collective) point that comments (historical) could be confusing in the version control paradigm..., however,  the comment overhead vs. benefit seems to me to low. (keep everything comment wise) to be low that is i think we\\'re talking about two different things @terabyte. if you\\'re developing software as a product (then yes, version control mandatory) and selling it (or distributing it) that\\'s one thing. if an organization is developing something in house to do (x) for party b (again, this is not my situation) there are different demands. no kidding i\\'m not arguing against version control however, it\\'s not used in all situations  that\\'s a great skill set @firecodergithub  i would say go for it... project management (because let\\'s face it a lot of projects are systems/software/db based) build a linux box even if you don\\'t use it as a server no doubt. you\\'ll find as you build and use linux all the other stuff will go into virtual machines headless, all cli (great) virtualization (in real server sense i.e.,  running a linux box with a virtual git server as a vm ,,, no clue) i have to say the quality of topics is pretty high (at least at this moment in time). could drop at any second though sounds like (unable to determine without code) that you may have wrapped !important with quotes @danielnora , that\\'s making me want to skip ahead you can post code ups your chances of getting resolution/answer % wise ok, is the regex lesson (i.e., language agnostic but really aimed at js) going to mess up how i use in bash? yeah regex is language agnostic (acknowledged in my comment)... there are flags, that differ as yo point out, but there are different flags (flags + flags) in sed etc. my question/point was: will this mess up my flow.... hopefully, nobody will be throwing wrenches at me for motivation (i.e., the dodge ball movie reference) lol the default avatars, says it\\'s auto generated by hash, does this include color? (i.e., is the randomness bumped up by color as well as shape)? (i don\\'t have a default, but just wondering) is it wrong to eat a whole pack of pudding in one sitting? not sure i can, now really sluggish (oh, chocolate and vanilla) lol this isn\\'t the same x-screensaver like on xfce (and other desktops/distros) is it? maybe mixing object notation even if you could get around the installation aspect of application. pairing aps aren\\'t advised in work environment (your network admin will love you for not doing).  suspense i was just adding that, to see if things have slowed, or my browser is cr*pping out or becoming non-response non-responsive any good tuna salad recipes? (minimal ingredients in addition to the can of tuna) that\\'s cheating bread is a single ingredient (but in separate parts) so, it\\'s bread + tuna @mathmaniac0 lol, ah yes, good ole \\'allrecipes\\' . it\\'s the stackexchange of tuna which is now known as alphabet or something like that (depending on what division you\\'re talking about) no alphabet is google\\'s holding company (some new organization/reorganization) google: google alphabet same here. refresh often it\\'s what they don\\'t say in their instructions, that\\'s an issue as well. (you could \\'bing it\\' to find out more) @raviteja313 ,  sorry no, that was an oblique reference to an earlier post about google\\'s new holding company (and tuna recipes). not at all helpful to you. codecademy does, however, have issues with their instructions not being clear at times. yeah, it looks like it turns into a frame (scrollbar on right).... it\\'s really a pain or is a frame i\\'ve seen references to mobile version of fcc (does anything like this exist?) firefox will return an error if of \\'; missing preceding statement\\'  although different context oh, great (looking at map) there\\'s 38 bonfires i\\'m almost curious to skip ahead and preview the dreaded bonfires @mathmaniac0 good advice. @shengv5 , i\\'m pretty sure i\\'m not chinese. maybe i\\'m chinese and just don\\'t know it. who knows, all too deep for me. as an aside, although, japanese borrows base characters from root (chinese) language... avatar is kanji based (same diff without kana i guess) i think i\\'m finally coming off the sugar rush associated with eating entire pudding pack i think being a harp(not the cool blues nickname for harmonica, but an actual full sized stringed harp) player would be really inconvenient you\\'ll get a lot of js exposure, no doubt. \\'they\\' say that python is a good \\'beginners\\' language. (although, if you\\'re focusing on js, you\\'ll have plenty to contend with that alone) works for some. (it\\'s all really dependent on individual). if you\\'re trying to learn a lot of different languages at once, it\\'s possible to mix syntax, paradigm etc @mathmaniac0 , that\\'s true - there are modules you can use without even being versed (i remember i needed some function for a large file,  actually used python (though don\\'t ask me how i did it)  or was it perl, hmmm any latency issues with gitter? sometimes it seems to become unresponsive, then dips again, etc. hello, code folk hi @taybrid10  are you talking about putting an exponent into a variable oh, an actual binary number. looked this up there seems to be some sort of string conversion that needs to be done  yeah, long path. learn stuff, do stuff. takes time. it can be fun, challenging and a complete pita. i try not to use \\'fun\\' as a determining factor.. is it effective? (may be a better question - that\\'s just me) i remember navigator @bmorris22  procedure is -> close gitter app -> use browser. (ok, i\\'m just kidding i tried gitter app on linux and found that it was less useful than browser version) seriously it sucks @sjiaforever , there are different levels to things. if you\\'re interested in programming you\\'re working in a higher level of abstraction.  @bmorris22 , i don\\'t know if the gitter app itself is within git (i.e., can you actually contribute to improving it) @bmorris22 i think the reason for that could be you have, potentially, 100,000 people wishing to fork a project.    where\\'s the intermission popcorn? @bmorris22 , yeah that\\'s not scientific or anything, but when you login... it says a community for 100,000 + developers. so, i imagine they would have to put some limitations on their own software for their own sanity yep, there\\'s an intermediate string conversion step (re: binary) @bontooapp , do you have some immediate demand to return some wordpress customization? (if yes, go that route then learn the fundamentals. if no, just begin the lessons)   @bontooapp sounds like you\\'re at a crossroads... you\\'re going to want to do more than wordpress can offer (just a guess). take your time, learn... etc., nothing is a guarantee except wondering if you could have done it.  still waiting for (potential)  multi-paragraph critique lol ok, back. looks like i missed the whole coders vs. salespeople (ok, i scrolled) discussion good start creative take on \\'hello world\\'. (which i don\\'t think i actually said either) congrats @shelbygt  how is codeschool overall? @nicolevryan  you may want to check ms site. if you\\'re running all win machines, it could be some group policy thing (since you\\'re using a server) - more software than networking also, you may want to check for hotfixes for server 2012 for rdp services @dnorthrupva yeah, i noticed the fee thing right away when doing a search one thing to consider as well, are you self-signing certs etc. (i.e., you mentioned server (this is key no pun intended) @nicolevryan   @dnorthrupva sorry for the late reply. did you say codecademy is going for pro. (they can\\'t even get their free cr*p together lol wow, that\\'s a trip. i.e., that\\'s a trip with regard to codecademy i don\\'t find videos being very helpful.   that\\'s all ? just kidding. that\\' great, you will get a lot of js for sure @zacw02 i would look at the postings for talent that most consistently appear for your company (in terms, of track) and maybe let that be a partial guide if you\\'re after \\'their job\\' you might not be getting the best advise lol advice that is js is some serious stuff. that alone is why i want a more deeper understanding of it it used to be thought of as a not-so-serious language (read script) although i will say that js, does some weird stuff (i.e.,. has weird conventions etc) that throws me throw @hackingnomad true. to extend that a bit, i noticed that happening in codecademy a lot (that would be my 798th criticism of codecademy) js to me seems to by like a powerful all terrain vehicle. it can do things that other (vehicles) can\\'t, but it doesn\\'t have ac, usb ports, navigator or windows, doors, etc..  navigator? huh, no pun intended yep, syntax is hard to un-learn in the ad hoc sense (i..e, jumping from one task to another, i find this in scripting) regex isn\\'t intuitive at all (it\\'s always a pain) but when you need (and you will)... you be like \"wow\" you be = you\\'ll be if you have to extract those authors from a 1gb file, you\\'ll understand the power of regex a 1gb file that is unstructured  @itsalbow , if you\\'re well versed in securing transactions, perhaps. i would go with linking to amazon, so that both customer and client have a reasonable expectation of protection. copy before refresh (and you have to refresh a lot -at least that\\'s what i\\'ve found) like 3 weeks, done with js (the first part) ....now on regex still do js syntax highlighting can be achieved in just about any editor. (you can also, execute in some (with project tweaks etc) @nicolevryan that\\'s bad you have a web facing server with no firewall? that\\'s bad. you can call it your os (i\\'m not trying to be rude, please understand) however, if it\\'s shipped by ms as a server product, then it\\'s a different animal from other os.  well, i\\'ll give many points for willing to jump in and learn. what\\'s hubbers (git) up challenging, and good so far. community is probably the glue that holds everything together. it\\'s great are you talking about the beta site? there are a lot of editor to choose from. i see a lot of questions phrased how does a compare to b, when, really it\\'s a,b,c,d,e,... there are a lot of text editors from which to choose. depends on what your goal (and code focus is) yeah it\\'s all over the place i\\'m going to skip all that, and just have js imprinted upon me directly.  wakes up \"i know javascript\" @crisberrios, @dnorthrupva , i know that you were actually visualizing the scene \"i know kung-fu\" i give you nerd props  @jessieinsidecode yeah, but... most things worth while are not. i get that as well sometimes i\\'m like \"yeah, let\\'s do this!\", and other times \"must finish this lesson, must finish this lesson\" must....finish ....lesson that movie had a really bad soundtrack bad like bad the soundtrack is within my collection, so it rears it\\'s ugly head once and a while upon shuffle. i ff as fast as i can its not it\\'s all the time. as you get older short term memory begins to decay, and you\\'re like \\'hey that\\'s a great song\\' to pretty much everything you have that is unless you opt for apple\\'s new music service and you\\'re back to square one @monoxide27 , it just hit, me ... yes, they played that song over and over in the 80s along that same thread, heard a robert palmer song.. @crisberrios i wonder if you hum the tune into shazam (or like service) would it recognize sounds dumb, yes... what era? (show wise) yes, you can steal my idea. have at it. lol the same recognition pattern would apply (i\\'m sure the folks over at \\'zam have already got this in the works) fresh air? here\\'s a link to npr and the songs that they use for programs: http://help.npr.org/npr/ext/kb101-what-are-the-theme-songs-for-nprs-programs those are the actual themes attached to the programs, there are other links to the songs that they use as transitions from story to story editors and frameworks (in most cases) are two separate things an editor is really just a fancy syntax highlighting tool (yes, many have plugins, git integration, blah, blah-going for simple here). it\\'s a tool for authoring.  if your website goes down, that\\'s something else entirely oh nova driving over the key bridge at 8:00am sucks  been there done that np @crisberrios  @dnorthrupva , totally understand. even if you go the complete opposite direction (tyson\\'s corner) you\\'re pretty much well.... lol oh, now your screen name makes much more sense.  i thought it was hindi.... i didn\\'t even see the northern va elements in it....(could explain my non intuitive regex pattern \\'visualization\\') editor choice is subjective. try out a bunch of those (editors) see what you like @mildused  install linux are you using a light desktop, kde (although that\\'s my fav) can be heavy on resources hackintoshing it will make your life more complicated well, the \\'hackin\\' part of hackintosh, should give you a clue. lol good, grief... what are you running that da**n small linux isn\\'t. your problem isn\\'t os it\\'s hardware geany. although, i will say in trying out sublime there\\'s a project tweak that you can execute js files so, i\\'m kind of on the fence ```\\n//stuff\\n``` regex gets no love\\n regex is powerful. although, in the curriculum its utility isn\\'t demonstrated really. \\n is that a memory address? i.e., avatar i mean screen-name, it\\'s late @0x0936 , yes. clever, indeed @emmachen, yes... (i\\'m no master at those, though i use a lot and am currently on that section)  - it\\'s because knowledge isn\\'t applied  i think i said something earlier, today along the same lines. the first time you\\'re presented with some mammoth text file, (apart from js context) that requires some sort of manipulation/extraction... regex will be your goto  the knowledge alone of regex will propel your understanding of what\\'s possible. when i first discovered it (along with the whole stream paradigm) i was like holy cr** i still don\\'t completely understand it. regex isn\\'t really good for html, xml tags, there are tools for that although, still use it in that/those context/contexts which reminds me, is xml covered in curriculum that\\'s too bad. hola coders lol gitter (even browser version) has some quirks collapse doesn\\'t always seem to work is this \\'friday time\\' (for those time zone where it is in fact friday)... or, are there particular difficult exercises being pondered? i\\'m guessing you\\'re not the only one i\\'ve seen heroku mentioned a couple of times. is it easy to work with?  is there a free version?(btw, not a ruby devloper...but based on their (heroku) documentation, you do need a proc file be awhile until i get to the weather app can i use blue lighting and lava as a background, or would that be too much? (one can dream while in regex) the semicolon thing has happened to me as well. the design thing is context specific (as @stx146 ) points out... to me though, a lot of \\'highly stylized\\' fonts end up making site look cheesy (imo) that\\'s the great thing about css, it can be \\'mass cheesy\\' or not. all in a snap... the late 90\\'s  it seems every office had \\'that one person\\' using comic sans type font. provides some perspective on how end-users might perceive your site with stylized fonts ctrl + alt + (whatever) is difficult, can understand the mappings do they go back to codecademy in the bonfires? (recently finished js section, enjoying the ca break) is there a point (in curriculum) where you\\'re directed (or encouraged) to setup \\'a codepen\\'  looks like they sell t-shirts too. (just kidding, but do i need to setup an account?) oh, ok... @rodrigofierro , @michael-krebs ... i will say the \\'artsy types\\' gives me some indication. could be short term memory loss (don\\'t be insensitive lol) wireless devices are great and all, but i think i just saw a rabid sparrow infinite loop goto, very basic and visual basic basic was my first language as well monochrome displays rule explanation and the fact that the omit key things in their examples (ghost entities) that alone is worth the price of admission (which, um, well is free but you know what i mean). (not being required to use codecademy) still haven\\'t tried the plug.dj thing, have to put it on list yes, the cash register was a painful slog makes regex seem like happy times eventually, after 100 different tries  i think i spent 3 days on the last 4 lessons for cash resister (which i recall only had 7 items total) so, yes it\\'s all of the following: 1. completely stupid, 2. makes no sense, 3. why not use loops ? ah, the non-existent string will get you every time at the car? i agree, staged.  the structure looks like it was built in the 80\\'s, 70\\'s.... and he\\'s aiming at the triangle thing  how do you get the items to expand to fit screen? it renders with extra space on the right... is there a frame there? just skimming the masonry paradigm (search results) trying to figure out the whole grid thing if you\\'re testing on local machine, your resources need to be in same directory as .htm(l) or specify a valid path  sounds to me that their domain wouldn\\'t be in the mix until you transfer to production from your test site (i.e., i think what\\'s being described is the test project would be linked to your site. (but that\\'s a good question: keeping the client\\'s work in progress only \\'view able\\' by you and client)  and you can probably (after setting up your site) create separate logins so clients have access to only their projects.  there\\'s no closing style tag (and is in wrong place) it\\'s for instruction (i.e., internal style)... on how to use classes etc. they use inline and internal style to demonstrate the concepts, (that way user can apply to external style sheets, and not have to go to pre netscape times to adjust stuff) that was a fast pivot from css to booze, you guys are all over the place (thus wondering if your self assessment is accurate lol) well, that depends have you reached the challenging aspects  the html , css  stuff is pretty easy  there\\'s actually a linux screensaver with the matrix theme \\\\b([a-z-a-z]{1}) i don\\'t know if that\\'s \\'the way\\' to do i. but it\\'s \\'a way\\'  \\\\b([a-z-a-z^\\']{1} (simple i\\'m not excluding every character or working on your actual string) then it must be implementation specific, that selects the first character ^\\' is extra  try the first one (without ^\\' ) or with--- in regexr.com that will give you an idea on concept (where you will eventually apply to your actual string) ```\\n/*in regexr.com\\n\\tyou have this: /-your pattern goes here-/g\\n\\ntry this:  \\\\b([a-z-a-z]{1})\\n\\nshould look like this:\\n/\\\\b([a-z-a-z]{1})/g\\n*/\\n``` again, i don\\'t know if it\\'s the way to do it... \\n i think the infinite monkey theorem is bs.   rock on, @ollyjohn  yes, in nutshell a the problem is it takes shakespeare out of the mix. so, in essence mathematical infinity is what exactly? (pretty deep, next to regex lesson)  it\\'s metaphor for input tip: type three backticks ``` then shift+enter -> write/paste code (after the ``` and between closing ```) to format into gitter mu (makes questions easier to answer) it\\'s so friday. just type ``` you\\'ll figure it out i have to read up on def usage going at my own pace.... fly through everything (and then forget...) seems pointless there\\'s a reason js is not the first entry into curriculum   why you will go from wrapping elements around cat photos to slogging away at code in no time lol or stateside even @zildjianavedis yep so, for a lot of people is it career path change, learning something new, augment skills, etc.? have you figured out the magic formula? (i.e., converting this, or potentially so)  into substantive skillset well, not literally oh, i see @ollyjohn  that is so true but, be careful... coders are on a lower rung yes, behind receptionist and janitor way well, they will competing with the janitor for best parking spot of course i\\'m kidding. it\\'s just a take on the \\'barrels of money\\' stuff that people expect without actual experience, it\\'s a bit of a stretch i\\'d like to change mine as well, but the front-end technologies are just wrapper for me it doesn\\'t matter what they segregate, you have so much learning opportunity   there is a correlation between looks and income sorry to say see ya @ollyjohn  depends @zildjianavedis asking questions really is encouraged  in fact, you will get a lot of feedback @sonyakhan pretty much i was like wtf, i have to go say hello to learn the curriculum, but the community is pretty good  it\\'s good (the community sense) because, you\\'ll get fierce debate about all things code (there\\'s a range of experience along the spectrum).  you can pickup a lot  or long periods of silence lol i hope they are not still teaching flash animation there\\'s some credits that go into nowhereville  although, i will say there\\'s still things you can do (in that nearly obsolete, hopefully) technology that you can\\'t in css and html5 can you create detailed objects, in canvas? layered, independent clips, sounds, all with js? hmmm, all within a full ide? so, you\\'ve created said complicated animation in canvas? i get opengl on the conceptual level (i\\'m a linux user) so, the rendering aspect is very technically possible ok, you\\'re making the point with the ide side (as well as adobe\\'s have to do this to stay competitive aspect)  well, they are on the downside. so, survival, etc.  choose whatever appropriate word  my point isn\\'t  \"adobe is great\", it\\'s: \"the gaps aren\\'t are not filled in yet\" and you do a lot of complicated animation? yes, and with that you\\'re actually arguing for adobe as the authoring engine uh, huh. that\\'s correct it depends... if the flash specs carry over into a canvas export 1:1 then no gap mostly ide yes so what\\'s the preferred ide and framework? i guess my question to you (in terms of gaps) and again, i\\'m not advocating flash (it\\'s history) are you animating strictly mathematical objects (svg, or game frame work rendering blah, blah) or can you apply the same against any image @dannyfritz opengl is great... and trust me, i\\'m not a fan of proprietary software being used as elements of a webpage. oooh, it has console commands nice   refresh (copy first) np i learned that the hard way nothing like a codecademy exercise mocking you for 20 minutes i think i\\'ve said this before; however.... either they are stellar brilliant (throwing logic traps, and omiting stuff, and putting stuff in that came out of nowhere) or the lessons have issues (ca)  you know you\\'re a nerd when it\\'s nearly 10pm est and you\\'re talking about code...  on a friday no less so, what did you do? oh, i was doing regex exercises regex? wtf is that? (sorry, i had to do the dialog part) lol what differentiates paid vs free coding resources? are the paid coding schools \\'better\\' ? hello @jctm30  no really, no thoughts on paid vs free  ? that\\'s not really insightful @viznev  in terms of quality, quantity, etc.  so, is it a lecture or is there some staff member (i\\'m not that this is great) walking you through examples? huh, i might look into it/those... in addition wait are you saying the staff (teaching via lecture) are mean? wait, i\\'m not paying for mean lectures lol so, i wanted to find out more (i.e., about the cert) and clicked the camperbot\\'s link, it gives me option to modify (is this intended?)... is there another link i can use? is camperbot as sanctioned entity? (i.e., is it legit ) ah, so camperbot is not a sanctioned fcc thing @quincylarson , that\\'s all i needed to know... camperbot has had some coffee, i can tell it\\'s relative um @camperbot (not suggesting you\\'re human or anything) can you repost the cert link?  nice argh. it wants me to create a page (vs. just viewing)... it\\'s github @dcsan that\\'s the working url (thanks) yeah but the url works i totally like that, it demonstrates (dare i say it) humanity can you do it with onenote (i\\'m reaching here, i like shutter for linux) i think mentioning windows somehow crashes gitter see, it happened again.  it has arrows i\\'m sold the for of... thing looks interesting (yes, got me interested and looking at the git page) some of the implementations will give you closing ``` as well just try typing ```. don\\'t put/paste your code on the same line but between the top ``` and bottom ```  doh, i didn\\'t escape my own instructions rock and roll @shoeblaze  do you find that eating anything with slightest amount of oil tends to get this really irritating film on keyboard? omg hand gel doesn\\'t work. now what? hello @braindeadengineer  ok, you could have gotten some really easy brownie points. but no, you\\'re brownie pointless and i not only have oil but seaweed powder on my hands. nobody wins lol regex (and familiar with it, haven\\'t mastered it) and = am i use it in bash (sed).   mozilla dev well, they do have a special history with js you have some serious typing skills jim henson has nothing (well he can\\'t at this point) on you @dcsan is camperbot semi automated? btw while @quincylarson is on here. the community is great. there\\'s a high level (and at times lively) of quality to discussion.  @dcsan i\\'m  going to (wait for it, keyword: thank you) check it out @dcsan , i\\'m not messing with the gitterbot repo. i will, however, (i\\'ve been reading the read me) digest it... looks like a great read-in to a live project...  i get that a lot @dcsan , i was going the kanji route (not a lot of difference root language and stuff) @dannyfritz it\\'s supposed to be serenity, but i get \\'calm\\' vs in chinese discussions a lot  there\\'s kana in that... that\\'s japanese yes, i attempted to learn writing in japanese.. many years ago i didn\\'t retain much sounds like a neat app @luishendrix92  i bought a book on slang and everything there has to be a hook a different angle to it there has to be a japanese open source dictionary that you pull into the string not actual japanese characters but westernized  that\\'s a good start, but it returns kana that would be a nightmare with the character encoding or not (it would be for me) here\\'s a dumb question: does google expose their translation (i guess api?) functionality? oh, drop that then whoops, sorry about that. totally hogging.  hi, people (and non-ai people, who are are people too) hi @jbmartinez  hi @sonyakhan  bees seem to love coffee. (drawback of sitting outdoors with device) looking at script (js) sources also helps (i.e., you begin to see patterns/structures) @sonyakhan, if they\\'re codecademy based (ugh) they shouldn\\'t be affected   ncurses or pretty script? there something to be said for standardization, but coders are creative (that\\'s good imo) , so you solved it there are some good (subjective yes)youtube videos search - javascript objects (then do your own scrolling) @cobunny not suggesting you don\\'t know youtube search, look at the number of views, comments etc. make your own choice the brownie point thing should factor sarcasm lol @cobunny are  you past the \\'basic\\' point of js (i just recently completed, and am now in regexville)... are there certain things about objects that you\\'re having issues (my experience was similar with codecademy...) ? still battling bees for my coffee @cobunny, mdn is pretty good for that. the subjective aspect (and hence the hesitance) is codecademy doesn\\'t explain (and carries over stuff from nowhere) exercises well. so, even with grasp of concept you\\'re not guaranteed headache free    mozilla developer network https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/guide/working_with_objects i think callbacks are covered later in curriculum transition party on garth the broken image link (i think) probably started a couple of days ago @julianyc don\\'t see a closing style tag yeah it\\'s a percentage value...  what exercise is this (from)? the ` ` ` (extra \\\\s added so as to not activate) should not have any text on same line (paste code in between) activated anyway.... grrrr @gts0uk indeed. (but very handy) nice just don\\'t overwrite my progress. lol  whatever the outcome, good luck with migration (not using specifier: who needs a million messages while in process) anybody \\'think in regex\\' do you naturally see patterns, or do you have to fiddle to no end that\\'s prevalent for sure lol yeah, that would suggest that you might need to apply more to your personal life @abhisekp has got a pretty good handle on it. (btw there\\'s another element ) fire bad. (phil hartman) ok, since both @phlmoney and @abhisekp are about... there\\'s was one element in the regex that was not considered ooh, and @dcsan  think us holiday u.s. thanks giving @phlmoney  not everybody can spell.. lol lol good luck @dcsan  as long as you\\'re not trying to make a forward/backward negation reference work in regex @fcordoba84 you\\'re doing great, you\\'re doing the excises and talking about (those) i don\\'t need em\\' you can just \\'think thank you\\'  unless i get free coffee then all bets are off you know i noticed on different wikis that show moving screen shots etc.  are those animated gifs (look like short clips) or links to video (generally speaking)  ah, world time. another thing to put on the list and then metric conversions lol @fcordoba84 if you\\'re working in css then, that\\'s associated (for another few hours at least) with codecademy site that looks like a good link help fcc is migrating their beta to production (i believe) hello @dajust  how do you like it? @kparelius  regex site (and topically overall) that is  https://regex101.com good to fiddle with your own patterns (just learned about it from other users in the last couple of days) @dcsan say i forked a project (just hypothetically, ignore all my git details) um, what happens accidentally that is community is very newbie friendly  no clue, is that moment.js? oh, that seems to be akin to cast/convert in t-sql, (maybe will jump ahead) hi @jpayne0810  every time i hear/see software engineer, i can\\'t help but think about office space  software engineer is a good thing if that\\'s your path, awsome a lot of resources to learn (to help you get there) is there any way to list fcc rooms without thumbs? (or use a text based search) well, if anything... got a preview of bonfire to come.  so, i take it the consensus (friendly dates) is a real pita? hello @jmrex77  oh, that\\'s bad news @saadanerdetbare  lol help formatting @saadanerdetbare some of by completed stuff looks odd (i think it\\'s the transition) my try pasting your code (using the formatting instructions) do this type three backticks then press ctrl+enter then paste  your code should be sandwiched between top backticks and bottom backticks. then press ctrl + enter again hi @majeye @sonyakhan  awesome @draxell  you\\'re stealing my verbage lol you have an extra space after img-responsive some of my waypoints have been undone noooo but expected it would be cool if camperbot\\'s  eyes turned red based on ... yes, @desiderata33 i finished said (read evil) cash register being semi-literate is no guarantee for success when it comes to codecademy instructions entire code (not just the section that you may be thinking is issue) it\\'s part of \\' the test\\' (it gauges your ability to deal with complete ambiguity and bad scenario setup) (codecademy)  @dnorthrupva, i think it\\'s just a straight delimiter scenario (if you\\'re talking strings) str.split(\"-\"), str.split(\"_\") or str.(\"whateverdelimiter\") comma separated string (or array)   @jmrex77 that will do it (invalid link) happens to everybody on char off here, one missing whatever there one @dnorthrupva i can totally see, why the .split thing is frustrating. done the mdn example (which should work) but not working. doh, after.. you haven\\'t lived unless you\\'ve had canned spaghetti i don\\'t know if complete, but site is undergoing transition, if you\\'re doing a fcc waypoint maybe that could be issue? if it\\'s codecademy, then uncertain i still think eyes turning red at too many brownies for camperbot would be cool and an animated head turning @phlmoney, so is it fork then pull? (project) brownies or points @phlmoney thanks thx , etc. (lol) ok, so i didn\\'t break anything darn, so i didn\\'t have to fork http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript (only because i wonder this myself) you want to understand the concepts though. you\\'ll need to demonstrate at some point down the road i\\'m not rushing through each waypoint, (like a video game level)... the concept aspect is what i\\'m seeking the first link (not the accepted answer but the one further down) i thought had a good take (good be wrong (so)) good = could i wonder of what % of geo requests (browser based) actually are completed without user approval (yes you get \\'blah want\\'s to use geo okey, dokey or not) of what? ok, that makes no sense -of true, ip can be relative... vs. a mobile device wine can be a real cr*pshoot playonlinux has an interesting front-end to wine but things still (at simplified level) don\\'t work right...   forget that lol you must work for symantec that\\'s their opening customer service greeting @jbmartinez , well nothing to see here.... i don\\'t whether they are getting my location from ip or gps... just seems to me the scope of potential data is just too irresistible for marketing mind right,  bob\\'s pizza is x miles from your location, and guess what there are coupons!  but a high % of people just accept default to everything anyway... so, it really doesn\\'t matter bye @saadanerdetbare  bye @jbmartinez  and bye me too i like the new look (site) where\\'s my progress? lol @abhisekp sweet i have however, combining outdoors with laptop (does that count?) @abhisekp ok, i\\'m not worried. it will work itself out. (there\\'s git (and backups i\\'m sure) @p3rand0r codecademy exists independently of fcc, your progress isn\\'t affected (there) @shgysk8zer0  me either @p3rand0r sorry, i misunderstood (where in the progress map you\\'re currently) if camperbot could do conference calls, that would be awsome wow you can toggle camperbot\\'s api and chat as camperbot no kidding @thiagoferreir4  the in-house part i like (more consistent approach, and i\\'m guessing more control of said approach)  how do you control the hogging of bandwidth? (i see messages like waiting for youtube to load etc) i think it\\'s slowing my view (not in the db sense, but my experience at the browser level) -there\\'s not a spike in mem or cpu, but gitter looks to slow not flash based noooo (lol)  i\\'m on linux so flash based stuff is problematic.. i guess i could go the wget route (seems painful by all accounts/forums)  @benmcmahon100  ty for the links (you\\'re likely sleep deprived i\\'m guessing) @saadanerdetbare don\\'t envy you (sharepoint (any version))  that\\'s one of the problems with it (sharepoint) it\\'s in read only state most of the time  ah fun with regex are sparrows aggressive birds? one landed close to me with mouth open(appearing to intend to bite) this happened to me the other day as well (i thought it was rabid lol) @alexbrotman i don\\'t think it was thinking \"hey, worms\", it was more like \"i need food watch out!\" @harry9656  good regex follow-up  testing string: trolly hmmm. i think the caption probably sums it up without actually activating link @alexbrotman that\\'s him, yes! is that obi-wan? lol hi @ollyjohn  @harry9656 that\\'s even closer than the first sparrow they\\'re probably still transitioning stuff eating discounted potatochips was this a an oreilly talk? -a the transition (beta to production with users) is also instructive in a way: gives some feeling (although at some distance) of what the (frantic parts) transition entails. i think it plays iron maiden 24/7 but just a guess, i don\\'t know so, will mongo mess up my (very much relational) comfort with database dev? i know that, i\\'m talking about switching (mindset wise) back and forth from non-relational/relational how do you index? lol @saadanerdetbare  i\\'m going to take a wild guess that you\\'ve had experience with query optimizer in ssms  @saadanerdetbare yep. i\\'m a linux user, but i do like ms sql server. (i\\'m supposed to like mysql) which reminds me, are there any plans to have a mysql waypoint? lamp is very much inline with stuff.... it\\'s pretty subjective @mysticsage . you usually find out what the limitations are for each editor based on what challenges you encounter (i.e., what you develop, git stuff, etc) geany but working with sublime (haven\\'t made up my mind) some people like default black backgrounds lol is atom java based?  huh, it should run faster @michael-krebs i\\'ve found sublime to be somewhat on par with geany resource wise (haven\\'t pushed it though) are you manually pulling? so say i\\'m running git on linux, and i clone a repo... is there an update mech to see (run) the latest pushed changes? @robjloranger thank you (wait for it) brownie points i like cli so that\\'s great so, are there basic (and i\\'ll do a search as well) courtesies / protocols for pushing changes (e.g., commenting style, indents, etc.) to projects. (or, is it sort of based on the project collabs)  @michael-krebs that\\'s handy thank you (enjoy your brownies)lol techno sucks? nooooo the use of techno (i\\'m just speculating) is meant to make you a)stay motivated or b) go insane for you .... i\\'m missing entire word groupings hmmm i hadn\\'t considered the 3rd possibility  attrition by techno it was so 90s along with \\'industrial\\' (really metal + techno) i tune out on too much video instruction i\\'m just waiting things out. not doing any progress capture stuff what kind of db? presentation of data is (in most cases) is different from data structure... just because you\\'re not seeing it... doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t exist or actual data residing in various tables when camperbot passes turing, it\\'s going to be pissed with all the brownie work it has to do oh, great... i get to pass out more brownies, it\\'s so great that i\\'m now a sentient bot lol @michael-krebs that\\'s what (it) wants you to believe where\\'s the love? camperbot aquiring .... prime directive changed. play journey 24hrs a day yeah, it\\'s a total migration (not a small task) expect that things are going to be off in the short term but retain the info concepts etc. siri connects with a server to perform local tasks (music, commands etc.) what\\'s up with that? @michael-krebs no doubt they (both goog and apple) are skimming the actual questions asked (patterns,  like where can i buy turkey) i actually like voice commands.... totally there was this tom jones song jones\\' grr magic most companies customer service sucks. i don\\'t think that\\'s limited to the u.s. s\\' damn fios @saadanerdetbare i think those csr(s) get dinged if the mention throttling  they that applies with regional accents in us as well i think those cables are sealed (just a guess) it\\'s in the middle of a migration @jenprichard  no idea i was wondering about that (there was no .append in the first paste) thought i was losing my eyesight  i have to agree with that sentiment @saadanerdetbare  never give up your critical thinking in favor of acceptance. that question has significance well beyond learning. but i would say that rather than thinking free/vs paid (with regard to service outcomes, etc.) they\\'re developers - you\\'re a (potential) developer. if all goes well, you\\'ll be on the other side of the question soon enough. @bronin i think the high quality is there. you may be confusing temporary service migration with quality.  @bronin  oh, i see the general direction of your point now. linux is free and it rocks! i would pay for linux over windows if i had to. so the quality aspect or stigmatization (e.g., linux ) of opensource (and there are different levels of free as in beer) is known.  @dannyfritz so true. (and if you want to go enterprise level all kinds of pay opportunities) @missdelilah that\\'s a level of honesty that\\'s great i think allrecipes or epicurious has that (i.e., give ingredients here\\'s what you can make) first world problems steamed rice (with anything topped) is good no, go full chipotle it\\'s the only way i find the salsas the hardest to mimic oh, that\\'s so depressing and late 80s to boot and garlic.... makes it easier to peel butter coats everything in the pan, (too heavy)  it\\'s a sauce or reduction element (i think)  cooking is the fallback lol i think i\\'m going to setup git in a sandboxed vm why not? keeps development stuff (including directories) from my other stuff which can be (also) development stuff @arielleslie yeah, linux vms are almost disposable, in terms of their ease of setup @arielleslie one thing, if you setup a vm you may need to bridge the networking connection (easy click) so you can use \\'a server\\' sorry, took a moment to read over cloud9 blog.. seems it\\'s sort of an experts-exchange for development and also \\'a cloud\\' vm (interesting) or mess with regex for an hour or two noooo, i so thought that clippy from office 2003 was gone @portablestick , great now i\\'m thinking about how xp used to look,  the .pop is interesting. you can throw it in a loop and take all the elements out right, you\\'d have to offset @benmcmahon100  (and you\\'re right it looks error prone) i\\'m taking a break from progress stuff while things are in flux. there\\'s a lot to learn fill learning time with out there delete what? cra* is that in general, or are you addressing a specific issue  ok, whew nm the room menu - ability to toggle to a list/link (plus search) (no idea implementation or support desire for feature)   @mindfulbell i disagree: codecademy does challenge your brain...it forces you to wrap your mind around things that don\\'t work. lol @kahwasaurus you may want to paste your code (if you\\'ve done already sorry) help formatting i\\'m glad the cats are still with us. ok, no i\\'m not lol those are fun. (esp failing on missed case) that\\'s not a bad video (o\\'reilly conf)... but create some strings and use the various regex sites (like mentioned regex101, regexr, etc.) hypothetical doesn\\'t work with regex (or anything else really) the \\'right answer\\' is really subjective (imo) not always, but i think that\\'s why you see a range of opinion on different things my guess would be they probably want more control over their curriculum   @tourn171  ca\\'s js course was very confusing it sucked to no end blenders and betamax seriously though... javascript is a good bet. (nothing is truly future proof)  learn. hard work. luck. luck is multiplied the first two by the i still vote for javascript @kaylebor i agree. it (javascript) has matured over the years   @dnorthrupva that is true, and has been a trend for some time now the outsourcing thing has been a contentious issue for a least a decade (not commenting on its merit/non merit, just its existance) existence  another aspect, (seems to be) what do you enjoy?  development isn\\'t limited to front-end this/that. it\\'s easier to demonstrate concepts /knowledge acquired through projects that you enjoy (imo). and folks that hire (i think) pick up on this. or have had experience with i think there\\'s a fcc room that is dedicated to the dev job aspect to things @ashroulston they went through a migration... i don\\'t believe stuff is \\'lost\\', might take awhile for it to display again that\\'s not entirely true. they know what they want, just not how to get there (there are some that fit category). no clue, but it\\'s a migration of approach etc., i imagine there\\'s no opt-out  i think chewbacca has a serious conditioner bill @aaronooooo paste your code (you bump your chances of getting help up) i don\\'t know if it\\'s fits your needs (or how a split will effect etc.) but this: [\\\\.,] matches periods, comments it\\'s = it periods, commas i mean backtick is to the left of 1 key (top left) good job @wikiwookie what kind of regex are trying to match? nm right the /g is all matches @aaronooooo , you have some spaces in your tags leading spaces a temp wiki (what happens to stuff while in migration (progress, etc.) probably needs to be done you want the code to be between the backticks you can check string length, and check for the existence of different characters in string (like a phone #) then perform some action on string or prompt user etc. so, i\\'m looking at my 98% reduction in  completed waypoints (i now have 2). i know it\\'s in backup (but when am i going to see an update)? are you trying to format the string (i.e., no prompts...just stripping out spaces and adding pars, dashes etc)? if it takes you 15 minutes to learn regex, you\\'re genius level (lol)  i would test the length of the string (phone number) not (with the regex, but you\\'ll use that to format your string) @dvanrooy yep i now have a solid 2 completed waypoints (perhaps is a demotion ) if i were, like, on the last thing before non-profit... the wonky map would have probably freaked me out a bit. so, 100 and some change doesn\\'t really matter.  @quincylarson , i\\'m guessing that it is (i.e., database not synced) i am forced to login with git creds @quincylarson that\\'s it (i least i think) what\\'s happening is either a bookmarked link or browser cache, (and this is a good tip for others --wiki) presents (have to login with these methods) nice you\\'re hashing out your text in h4 i know @dting , but doesn\\'t look right ah, the gitter parser... my apologies so, i think my login experience (post migration) might benefit other folks in wiki.. thoughts? fun with campbot, hey @abhisekp  they were well earned (i (and many others) completed those js hours in codecademy (which is a distinct entity)... codecademy is not the clearest in exercise setup @ewreck don\\'t be afraid to make mistakes. (well, you did say advice lol) it\\'s painful to think what you would add to 10 to make 20.... i was looking for the exercise that stop my progress in its tracks. da*n (lol) stops yeah, i\\'ve skipped ahead to view the challenges... (and they are challenging i\\'m no expert) i was  being facetious @doxanthropos i completed the ca basic js. it sucked. i have, a somewhat, good grasp on language (natural and others) and their instructions are horrid but going to the other extreme (too much hand holding) can, also, be an impediment (i don\\'t know the magic answer)  ugh, codecademy. ok, there are other practice methods... maybe i\\'ll look into those as well yeah books are good books... good. me like em (i\\'m trying my best to do p. hartman as frankenstein) also, it can create a \\'fishing for brownie points mentality\\' (i\\'m a worst case scenario project type) that (in some instances) that may not be helpful. -that @aaronjudell is saying that folks can game the system (which is what i think he\\'s saying and is what i\\'m suggesting) no over time i think the general brownie argument (isn\\'t a lockout akin to network hits) is folks could sit and rack these up over an extended period of time -but wouldn\\'t reflect their actual progress or (programming prowness) however you spell that me too (like i want to see my own progress again... (after i do the account fix thing lol) agree with @benmcmahon100 , on the profile view side... but brownies could be tweaked (imho non-expert ) what about an-opt in for brownie points.... like a msg (hey, if you found this person\\'s help, well, helpful click this or that to give them some recognition) like not an automatic key phrase, but a manual process to give brownie points (aka recognition) that would not dilute its value sorry not trying to be a pita, just thinking out loud... love the concepts behind this stuff @benmcmahon100 you folks do good work. if you were a scuba diver (in scuba diver chat) you would probably have to bounce all kinds of ideas around about which is the best way to do this or that. (i don\\'t envy you lol) i\\'m going to re-login (hopefully this will fix) and get back on track... good to know. (refocus time  i guess).  ok , now that i have the login straightened out. i feel better (progress is now showing) do i have to do the waypoints in sequence (i\\'d like to jump around based on my preferences + previous wp/experience) i.e., in new schema ok, wait for it...... (brownie points) thanks @dting , @thegoz85  processing? never used it, there\\'s also (apparently) a js version processingjs. did you find it helpful?   are you using at as a learning or deployment tool?  at = it what\\'s the command for in place editing of your comments\\n oh, you\\'ve got a bug track right in the exercise(s)  nice where\\'s the current bug search (i.e., how would i look up what\\'s been reported (avoid dupes and give me an idea if current exercise is buggy) @benmcmahon100  t h a n k s (only because i\\'m sure you\\'re tired of brownies) ok, @benmcmahon100  thanks! (i would send you more after seeing what you have to contend) @benmcmahon100 oh, i know it  :smile:  @jbmartinez yes, brownies are so tasty so, (in the new version of site) i\\'m going back and doing some (new) css stuff. is it me or are things not carrying over from one lesson to the next (e.g., you\\'ve created an element with id attribute, say, in one exercise...but have to recreate in the next)  after completing js in ca (it will be interesting to do over in fcc new) --- the challenges..... (hang on ) -use an id attribute to style an element-and the one before it. @willbonds that\\'s a good idea i suppose that it would add some amount of overhead (to retain previous code from previous example) @benmcmahon100 i see (was just conceptualizing it stored in cache) geany, notepad++, sublime (slowly starting to like it)  haven\\'t used brackets, but looks kind like adobe\\'s approach to things (in opensource version)  wysiwyg for css? (could be useful if you\\'re working with ps (so, i wouldn\\'t discount it completly) i try to avoid editors with wysiwig (don\\'t like that approach)... but if it\\'s about psd (ps format) that\\'s something that could be useful.  @ptsurbeleu, the breakdown of the function calls is very impressive  that could be handy @ptsurbeleu, i don\\'t think it would replace my goto text editors - but an interesting debug tool it could be (yoda syntax unintended) in addition to everything else  why were the cats kept? (largely rhetorical) the (evil) cat photo app you know the one @jbmartinez yes, i quickly found that out a decade ago lol @arielleslie oh, nothing at all. i love it. not that i have to hide my screen (like when in a coffee shop) with a cute cat app taking up most of the screen. well i suppose the cats are a good break from ca\\'s js lesson i will build the mother of all cat apps: input (n) behavior, and app tells you what cat is thinking (like that\\'s possible) can\\'t x,y coordinates of both frames be sync\\'d @jbmartinez they\\'ve already obtained it i saw some extension in chrome store (can\\'t test them out right now on a chromium build, long story) you can open frames in their own tab etc.... this might be a workaround for  @arielleslie yeah, let me test it out (will have to open chrome proper) and see if it works first) nothing really (apart from using scrapbook) on the browser side seems to work (i.e., having to scroll instructions when paired with using code editor) -- won\\'t call it a \\'failure\\' got to look at the structure of the layout (which was a lesson in itself) would have to be one heck of a developer job to make one move out of country lol is that sushi emoji i thought it was sushi, could be a beetle taking flight for all i know  didn\\'t the guy who played in that also pay in la law? play the original clash of the titans now i know hospital in german. @valenten okey dokey. (but it is hot out) so, i\\'m going back (or forward,) and doing the additional/new css exercises. good for practice, but i do feel a bit like  ruprecht  awsome @palmaone  do you mean that you were thinking negation like !=  welcome @jmacatk. you\\'re already 1/2 way there (you\\'re used to the rigor of certs): apply the same to this, you\\'ll do great  finished js (before transition)been demoted back to css.  sublime\\'s auto-complete is a time saver. have same issue (i.e., examples don\\'t carry over from one to the next - some suggest copy to cb, etc.) are there any (find the bug in this code) type challenges? (i.e., some messed up js, a little bit of messed up styling, things that slow stuff down, you know... that type of thing) you could call it someplaceholder if you wanted to. it\\'s looping (some thing)  thanks @camperbot  i love sending brownie points to the sending \\'entity\\' i\\'m warming to sublime  @majeye  i see a lot of complaints (un-verified) that atom has lag issues... does it run quickly (or comparatively so) for you? hackable good (is it easy to add user defined lang? (geany is a serious pita for this) i hope it\\'s awhile before more is added (not that i don\\'t like the practice), when i get to the end and 200 more exercises are added, that might be somewhat frustrating @majeye the field is relative (not front end for me)... i totally know about changing project parameters. moving goal posts with curriculum, is (for whatever reason) more problematic (at least for me)    @oneate7 , yeah it just bothers me seeing uncompleted checks next to stuff. (going back and doing the css is making glad that i\\'m not operating heavy machinery (which would be problematic while doing css -lol)   i will be less whiny when i (re) complete those lol @javamar paste your code (gets answer quicker) help formatting &&  ? js loves to mock me with its gotta do this but eh, that\\'s ok with other stuff what\\'s the fidelity level of the code pasted (i.e., does gitter ever do weird stuff with formatting)? maybe related (or gitter centric) i get crashes (maybe 40%) when switching to other rooms via the left pane 40% seems high, edit: 30%  here\\'s a dumb question: how does the wiki thing work (not the commands) but the general protocol. are there guidelines about who/how can create?  have to watch the oven intently (i always seem to burn (those) when using betty crocker) so, nobody with the wiki thing? (is it just the \\'wild west of wikis\\'?) that\\'s the second time i\\'ve seen that about angularjs lecturer lol  so, things are dynamic in pages, i noticed that ubuntu (*buntu based) +mono is being used in waypoint (i.e., doesn\\'t seem to fallback) - is this user agent based? it seems navigator properties are probably being referenced and then generated to match what goggleapis has by way of fonts (just a guess.) you may want to paste your code ```\\nlink href=\"http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=lobster\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\\n<style>\\nimg .smaller-image{  //<--this line looks suspect (i could be wrong)\\nwidth: 10px;\\n}\\n``` so did i answer my own question correctly? (i.e., navigator properties can be used to pull system specific fonts like in the waypoints)? \\ni have a hard time believing everybody has linux (i.e., not statically generated)\\n except fonts they get no love so, what does lurk mode do exactly? ok, why would user opt for lurk mode, (what\\'s the point? see same notifications etc.) welcome, hello @gromaguera  @arielleslie that could be one thing sure.  so, it\\'s not that (lurk) seriously.... nobody has any thoughts on machine (os specific) dynamically created stuff (like what it looks like in source of waypoints) wow. lol i need to figure out some sort of compelling project. theory (though required) sucks. @arielleslie that might be one of doing it (i suppose i can make an app that has a cat using a cash register, and testing other cats on arrays (building upon different exercises) - weird, but compelling. lol ok, i\\'m skipping the (additional new css waypoints) i already finished js basic.... any having to go back an do css is totally annoying me  any = and @saadanerdetbare feels remedial @saadanerdetbare noooo (and size those columns) if you\\'re just running (plain) js... you can execute in sublime- (came from a visual studio centric post/source but worked for me)  http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/370e35/how-to-run-or-debug-javascript-in-sublime-text/ @badbabykosh  i was wondering that as well mysql would seem a natural choice  say jquery didn\\'t exist. at what point in your understanding of js (and misc markup) would you invent it? (i.e., where does it make sense at a foundation(al) level) where = when i\\'m trying to pair (not necessarily in code) standard js with jquery . concept of first applied to (tool) of second. some of the resources (out there) are a little dated. any good recommendations for resources? are there things that you can only do with basic javascript vs. jquery (yes, dom based)  there should be (subjective yes) a room for deeper conceptual understanding of how different topics (exercises) relate to one another.  in addition to: \\'i\\'m having problem with x exerise # (not a a critique) some of the javascript waypoints i can see the actual (page) js displaying in the left pane doesn\\'t affect anything (if your code is correct it will run/pass)  @arielleslie agreed (the actual js function that\\'s being called to validate user input - can throw one off) \\'to join you must first prove your skills\\' seems a little intimidating lol i\\'ve seen it mentioned (codewars) do you have to be at some insane skill level (insert lang here) to use it? if you say that about any language you will be mocked by other devs so, i\\'m going back (or forward) to (re)do new challenges.. the check length of string variable wp is a little unclear: does it want me to return .length in console or by function? @saadanerdetbare (thank you for that) there were a lot of reasons, (all valid) the third party library thing with regard to global variables was one that made me go.... dang are the wp source pages (in edition to their content) a good way to figure out implementing alternatives to (obsolete) frameset? i think the hours is a thumbnail estimate of what it would take average person to complete why does the actual validation code show up in left pane of the wp ?(wondering for last couple of days)  community + examples are more consistent than codecademy me too, now i\\'m re-completing it hey, angular still has the videos lol the angular wp (via codeschool) is nice i\\'m the only one that critiques the production values of the actual screencasting/presentations of lessons (codeschool is very smooth)? that one is good (they also  show you how to draw shapes (other than squares and rectangles) in css) how does one find the time to read-up on the myriad of resources?  some languages the garbage disposal analogy works my issue is reading up on many different things at once.... jumping back and forth etc. feels unfocused would .substring work? (haven\\'t gotten to that exercise/challenge) infinite loops can do that you can try opening browser in another page/tab, clear cache then go back to the code that is crashing or temporarily disable js... what\\'s the difficulty level of the angular wp?  i like the \\'module\\' terminology it has a familiar ring in other contexts is angular just a matter of \\'moduler-izing\\' js for ease of testing/housekeeping? @benmcmahon100  that makes sense, i was wondering how to square the upkeep with code (vb modules came to mind) in js.... angular makes sense.  wow, so... with angular, you extend js from plain scripting... to what could be described as an application? that\\'s profound  me too (but a bunch of other stuff first) for corporate application, that\\'s a higher usage scenario (graphs, charts, reports) it must be a saturday thing: i\\'m having a lot of  \\'uh huh, that\\'s it\\' moments @gstayton  maybe the relaxed (saturday) state is inducing significant global comprehension. or, it\\'s the coffee  i\\'ve done that (drink tea when out of coffee) ...but it makes me just drop everything and go get some actual coffee @luishendrix92 had the same thought about codeschool angular, very well produced on a bunch of different levels is there a performance difference (theoretical) between changing an elements\\' value (in array) vs. removing said element and appending a new element? brownie point bonanza @gstayton, @dting, @mildused .  i was reading some stack exchange posts on js mem management (am all over the place today (in a good way), one topic leads to another...etc  dam* thanks, thx @dting , @mildused @gstayton  the grid thing reminds me of some linux ui implementations ah, it\\'s not a phrase that fires wwe was wwf world wide... hello hello this is world so external factors are not a motivator .... (i.e., internal motivation) sql never hurts by the way i know i\\'m going to have some clash (because i\\'m used to relational) when it\\'s mongodb time i understand that, the front end web-dev, gets me out of my comfort zone  do you no longer agree? lol  yeah, the quote others thing is freaky see it doesn\\'t parse into nested quotes with attribution you just did @chadkreutzer yeah, a lot of article type stuff is like that in terms of comments the parens are confusing \\'it\\' into thinking you\\'re trying to pass arguments to a function why\\'s the gitter markup making the first [ red? ah the evil semicolon and its more evil cousin \\'optional semicolon\\'  wiki meatloaf i\\'m really surprised there\\'s no wiki for that lol camperbot should (i.e., hypothetical) discern between a complimentary thank you vs. a thank you for providing knowledge thanks @camperbot  like \\'hey how\\'s it going\\'? reply: \\'it\\'s going great t h a n k s\\' isn\\'t a brownie point or is it? i guess it could be a good manners/civility brownie point (which seems odd lol) i thought i\\'d \\'learn more\\' by jumping between codeschool and codecademy for angular... i had no idea that codecademy\\'s angular could be more annoying than basic js i think they\\'re missing the irony in the presentation of the lessons @jbmartinez it\\'s too twitchy.... was you experience different? you = your the instant \\'run\\' on different things is driving me nuts (there is aside from the actual \\'run\\' button) there = this @jbmartinez (if the knowledge is good then, can ignore the interface) @julianaramburu , yeah that\\'s true, i didn\\'t think i\\'d use it again.. but can\\'t ignore it no idea, maybe it\\'s easier to ease into messing with dom than going straight to programming constructs (makes no sense to me either) some have suggested opening an incognito tab to get around the crash loop highlight and delete? why just the trailing part (if you\\'re talking about html comments) are you going to comment a subsequent line /block of text)? what exercise is that? place ending comment under the h1 line @co0lguy42 delete the first part of the comment block first (not the trailing) yeah, that\\'s it... it\\'s putting it back because it\\'s expecting to delete things sequentially wait, i thought you were doing a different wp .... let me look i must be well on my way to becoming awesome (got the stink part down)  @co0lguy42 did you figure it out? ``` ```\\n<!--  <---highlight this line first to delete\\n<h1>hello world</h1>\\n\\n<h2>catphotoapp</h2>\\n\\n<p>hello paragraph</p>\\n--> //if you delete this line first, script will just replace it\\n``` @jjordan88 brownie points. thanks, thx (for using \\'rad\\' in a sentence haven\\'t heard that in a long time)\\n  i would give you more... but there\\'s a cutoff lol you have a number of (local) options to debug/run js... (generic javascript console (insert browser), firefox has an ide, you can also run in sublime (with certain project setup) https://regex101.com/  (will make your life simpler (at least for regex) @terrorming , i think you can ignore those wp (that you\\'ve already finished).and continue on..(at least that\\'s what i saw in the 30 second roundup) i\\'m just redoing those for consistency (don\\'t like seeing lots of unfinished marks) but am not stressing over it  np @linusphan i understand that. angular (although, am still in process) was/is a light-bulb going off (or on)  @linusphan t h a n k you.... just kidding here\\'s brownie: thanks @linusphan  there are so many topics to get sidetracked... one thing that bugs me is the flashing this or that from the 90s hasn\\'t really gone away, it\\'s become more advanced (i.e., the potential gimmick value) i think let is more restrictive to current scope i think there are live non-profit projects that you\\'re required to accomplish/contribute. imo it\\'s reasonable to apply, but probably unreasonable in terms of expectations, if you don\\'t have projects/experience (in any context not just fcc) to show potential employer/client. can\\'t hurt to try.... was commenting more in terms of a competitive market scenario (don\\'t have the answers, trying to figure it out myself as well) hello @frawzey   this (in addition to everything else) is a great resource for resources (need to catch up on my bookmarked stuff as well) that plugdj is weird there are these avatars jumping around (sorry, to break the server deployment thread) @matteverson , i think i\\'ll bookmark that thanks, thx,  @0x0936 , i may just leave this thing on because plug.dj avatars are like a trainwreck one of the nice things, is \\'pay for what you use\\'  (cloud stuff: rack etc.) so, can i make the avatar in plug.dj move around and stuff ? i was going to go more substantive (like the server thing), but...how do you \\'woot\\' a song? @matteverson , thank you, i think the issue is there\\'s a separate sign-up (or least appears to be) for plug.dj so, i can see the messages (but like swazey to goldberg) but you can\\'t see mine (bad reference (and probably spelling) to early 90s movie: \\'ghost\\') hey somebody stole a sample from depeche mode you can\\'t avoid functions in js (some say \\'everything is a function\\' or \\'everything is an object\\') - or functions in really any other language what i\\'m still trying to wrap my mind around is the clear (or lack of) separation between sub and function in js it seems to be combined in function (i.e., do stuff and, optionally return stuff) right sub = do stuff if i think back to ancient days of vb (that comes to mind) i actually want to learn perl not a glamorous lang  i see utility (locally on a linux box) for some languages, because you still have to do stuff on the backend, even if it\\'s not directly front-end (if that makes sense) server side scripting.... they\\'re usually \\'built\\' with linux i\\'m not a java person either... but what is interesting is sometimes a recruiter will give a blurb about experience,.... and knowledge of a high level language is a plus @gstayton , me too... i wish i kept a scrapbook (link long gone) of this recruiter\\'s experience requirement summary ...it went something like \\'you can do a lot with javascript, but....\\' then went on to sort of poo poo it @gstayton , so true... it\\'s the same folks that say \\'how many lines of code\\'? which i yell at screen \\'if it\\'s a few lines, that\\'s code\\' if it\\'s \\'5,000\\' that\\' s stupid i always burn the brownies easier to buy from bakery i have an excuse.... had an ah huh moment with angular yesterday @alnano you can open a javascript console in most browsers and run it yourself i like firefox\\'s webide (although i set my runtime to their mobile) chrome/chromium still is the fastest... so, it get some amount of preference @alnano , it should be three bars top right -> tools -> javascript console np i have to figure out current draw of usb vs in wall charger ... phone seems to take a lot longer to charge via usb @gstayton it\\'s probably the plug--to wall (usb into two prong) that acts as a capacitor  1.5a is a lot.... that powers much bigger devices than a phone.... i think that would fry it i\\'m trying to go from memory @simonja02 lol lol hey, is that archlinux logo? yeah should be blue but looks like it though or (gasp) adobe i would really dislike it if an electrician had to google stuff that would suck oh, yeah.... no, it will work... let me just check my email... (checks google for electrician stuff) maybe a schematic for a specific machine.... but core competencies for an electrician? (or neuro surgeon )  no way run @0x0936 taking the general idea to the logical extreme.... there\\'s a difference in having references vs. core competency.  (e.g., you know enough about (n) to be able to know where to look for info (y). --  the original statement (using an electrician as an example) was not really aimed at somebody using electronic means to say (pull a schematic, etc.) but drawing basic knowledge from google...(kind of tongue in cheek)  c would be interesting to learn... isn\\'t it more direct with memory etc.?  so, we should know nothing (as it will change)? i\\'m  going to use that i agree with that. the conversation was actually about electricity (i.e., usb vs. wall chargers) i think the issue with metaphor... is that it\\'s being extended to web-dev. i think i can actually compile c in linux (maybe without additional packages) i have an ancient c programming book, looks scary @0x0936 everybody uses google, not just web-devs and electricians.  it\\'s a tool not xanadu @camperbot , are you sentient yet?  it would be cool if you could actually control the plug.dj avatar hello @raghuchandrasekaran  @jedpimentel does the c book you have, have an ascii chart towards the back? blue background with a really bad 80s cartoon c on front? (or late 70s) i\\'ll have to look (different cover) -also, includes ansi c from a style standpoint i\\'d take out the double closing tags on front end developer... are google and facebook the only two entities doing frameworks? (angular, react, etc.) seems like a pretty limited universe @benmcmahon100  ember has a \\'fork us\\' link are they on github? i see questions, about what wp are people on etc.,  for me, i come across a topic (like angular)/lesson... and it may send me on a journey far from fcc for a time.  it\\'s subjective (depending on the organization) some might value mediocre university over other things (even though some things (e.g., fcc etc., are more practical and up to date). if they\\'re fast moving (dev, startups etc. they might \\'get it\\' over others) piece by piece you can code on the weekends too already very much about cli, but got an email from codecademy about (that) as well. good for ca (and people that could benefit from it) tried the gitter app on linux, didn\\'t see any advantages over the browser version... so, dropped it where can i actually view all of the fabulous brownie points i\\'ve received? (or streak, etc.) i\\'ve been cheated. (no brownie points showing) @raultsc  glad it\\'s not my motivator, just curious @abhisekp yep that\\'s wp + brownies (so, confusing) t h a n k s @abhisekp  (if anybody, you\\'ll get that joke) thanks @abhisekp ! re-doing the css (in new version) feels disjointed with angular lol is it unusual to prefer js over css? having (which you don\\'t really \\'have to\\') do those over is a bit of a pain codecademy\\'s js lessons are a bit incoherent at times (however) do while loop seems problematic in un-compiled code you can also, do other exercises in tandem with fcc....  @benmcmahon100 , at least in the exercises... do while has other application when iterating over things with more stuff (i.e., yep, not just a guarantee of loop once) like checking against the values of an array (i think would be the closest i can get in this context) not arguing for do while loop... lol looks like it\\'s good for both jquery and basic js (have to read up on it) i should call it by its current script standard i think (it) wouldn\\'t take too kindly being called \\'basic javascript\\' off topic, but i used to use inkscape strictly for svg, but am finding it more and more as a complete authoring solution for offline docs. it rocks  so, is this something i will run into? (doing codeschool and other) -i.e., angular it\\'s one of the sections that still has \\'classic\\' video walk-through... but directs you to codeschool. is there an error that one will encounter coming back to fcc? hi @remainrelaxed  it would be a better challenge starting from zero knowledge i\\'m going to guess that the end challenge(s) actually have a godzilla sized cat with lasers coming out of its eyes  (just extrapolating from the beginning lessons with cat photos + progression lol) you know what, that could be a project @benmcmahon100 yeah. lol there was this 3d modeling software for linux (well, not specifically for)  i didn\\'t even attempt at really learning it.... is there a web equivalent? (canvas etc...) wow the red car is impressive thanks @benmcmahon100 i might actually check that out hey wait a minute your browser doesn\\'t support webgl (linux box ) maybe the font (in codepen) has to do with lato (and no fallback?) unrelated, i find that i have to (>40% of the time)) click run 1-3 times for things to kick in (fun modal and all) 3rd time might be paste related (i refuse to hand type a class reference over and over) it looked like it was running automatically (listener on key press or paste event) before in the earlier iteration( but post beta) is that the ominous dollar sign and dollar sign enclosed thing? i like the run button (even if i have to click more than once) makes interaction less shaky agreed (also, can see the progress (back end code to front end experience happening pretty quickly)  the loop is also, funny (because it never ends) lol maybe automatically comment the example code on save (of course folks would not be happy un-commenting code) that\\'s great (had no idea about the series ) maybe port related (but do you really want to host your projects on a local server (because that\\'s what your machine will become (if intended ignore comment)  btw hello @thehalibut and @davidnata83  yes, but you\\'re also a fish so that cancels out newb\\'ness i\\'m a newb (at least to front-end stuff) as well there are proprietary keys?  were they invented by m$? just kidding is there some sort of licensing (read volume use) associated with api key. like say, i have a site that gets a lot of traffic, etc.  how are the fees (generally) structured? @jbmartinez thanks... (this is interesting, i never considered) does one usually have a choice between open source and \\'keyed\\'? yeah, i wasn\\'t going to harp on dream weaver... but i did think it lol ok, so it sounds like (not that i\\'m at this point) one can do rack, aws, etc.. but then there are also, api costs to consider as well (production environment) for demo projects (associated with learning) is heroku viable option? can you throw assets  on heroku as well?  @jbmartinez , @benmcmahon100 , yeah... i think i saw the integration with ruby (and everything else )etc., when looking at heroku  a couple of weeks ago. (thanks, thx, than you -- brownie points) camperbot\\'s cutoff could use some work.  scenario: someone says \\'hello\\' someone responds \\'hello\\' first person says \\'t h a n k s\\' (for saying hello). 20mins later second person helps first person an \\'t h a n k s\\' is canceled. brownie points that is when one gets to the non-profit level, what\\'s the working scenario (i\\'m sure it differs by org). is it like a project group? is there a designated project maintainer that reviews stuff, etc.? @benmcmahon100 , i\\'m far from this (at the front-end level)... just wondering....  so there\\'s a project scope for non-profit and (i imagine) expectations for \\'deliverables\\' from the group? yeah, scope is important for sure one of the codepen examples got me wondering about arrays vs. collections i get, the key paradigm (accessing by etc.) mdn states there\\'s some uses memory wise, etc...  where would it make sense to use collection over array? (or, are they really the same thing?)  is it me or did animated gifs make some sort of comeback (i know they really never left)? i go through the exercises and it often sends (not directly) me to other sources to learn more...i want to understand the concepts, not just \\'power through\\' challenges.  probably an estimated century before completion. lol @benmcmahon100 , @michael-krebs , that\\'s funny (i.e., code contributors) yeah, if i hang on the streak thing... it doesn\\'t, always, reflect knowledge... weird dichotomy  am learning a whole c**p load though, (but still a front-end newb) relatively quickly @benmcmahon100 thanks for that (hoping to complete both codeschool and codecademy (yeah, that codecademy) angular courses awsome @prykor   is it me, or is there some stuff (e.g., code not carrying over, and references in, instructions to items not displayed) missing in jquery wp(s)? @arielleslie there is a \\'ghost in the machine\\'. i, literally, switched back to wp after comment ...and \\'stuff\\' was there.  that might be it (it was a mouse event that caused appearance /reappearance ) \\'mouse event\\' so 90s i should say \\'click event\\' that is interesting, (haven\\'t gotten to this yet) the function looks like it\\'s taking 3 arguments (not the combined single newarray) @kdbiddle yep. just thinking through example... what got me thinking (out loud sorry) is there are more arguments supplied than defined. @polsvoice , yeah have seen it but in other contexts that would error-out @polsvoice, i\\'m thinking in a non-js structure, i guess. if you declare a function in some languages (i\\'m going from memory) and you try to pass more arguments than declared... it will crash  @matteverson , @benmcmahon100 thanks... i\\'m still trying to wrap my mind around js\\' sort of \\'it\\'s all good dude\\' approach to stuff.   yeah, i had to quantify it in a catchphrase so i could keep my sanity lol that example doesn\\'t have any markup to render anything go for the formatting thing above (much, much easier) but you\\'re already way ahead @sherbethoover , you\\'ve got codepen already it\\'s like a code sandwich the backticks are the bread. you paste code between nice np , actually telling you about ctrl + enter was probably more helpful  (so, 1/2 brownie point lol) could approach, you\\'re probably familiar with spss wouldn\\'t a more data-centric approach be more helpful (not a critique but if you\\'re doing a dual masters... you\\'ve gotta sleep at some point) first solutions always (well almost) are bad habits. they\\'re the first step.  as you go along, and look back at code you\\'ve done in the past... that\\'s when you say: \"that is/was totally stupid\" i solved this with what\\'s in description replacing (n); but, i think @jbmartinez  solution is closer to real use. (i.e., \\'well\\' was specified) jquery is a bit fussy about unexpected tokens--- (figuring out compound stuff is a pita) yes, but wrapped in the script section (the jquery wrapper part sometimes throws me) that\\'s ok though, after the borg assimilation... frameworks, cross-browser tinkering etc. will be a thing of the past lol that\\'s one of the early exercises... which one is it @mrzappy ? that\\'s funny, i was looking right at that (sx vs. xs) -- and in highlighted markup.. blind i can usually tell if somebody is a developer (or it related, etc) without even talking to them. how weird is that?  hmmm, it seems to transcend physical attributes (although your examples are a dead give away) @ashroulston  lol you know i was avoiding \\'aura\\', but i\\'m entirely confident that i\\'m not the only one  i\\'m going back and re-doing wp (post beta to production)... you don\\'t technically have to though @strider99 maybe you can submit a unicode request... (the people there: \"smile is not gentle enough\", \"smile is too strong\"... ) lol demand more gentle emotes!  @jbmartinez agreed you probably need to install build-essential etc. in addition to the other suggestions, you probably want check which version of ubuntu you\\'re using (kde is installed over it by package or by kubuntu) lsb_release -a, and check some of the ubuntu boards  http://ubuntuforums.org/ would probably be a good stop  you mentioned both kde and unity (unless you\\'re selecting your desktop environment at the login prompt, you\\'re probably not using both at the same time) i some how stumbled into a c and java programming room (where\\'s javascript?) lol they know that: it\\'s just meant to make people spin their brains lol @danieldrasdo ,  there were some early issues with logins, (old git, new git), i remember there being a prompt to manage logins before (i had to fix mine)  @dnorthrupva is making me afraid of the \\'tomato clock\\' zipline, is it that bad/challenging? @dnorthrupva i like that approach this zipline (mention of it) has made me tune into sites that use countdowns etc... (.parse comes up somewhat (though not in this zipline\\'s context) some studies suggest that forcing yourself to take a break, helps with productivity - i have to see how it goes welcome @renovick  carbonfirelly nope. has word boundary, i guess.  i\\'m forcing myself to take a break, yet despite the studies i don\\'t feel more productive sounds more rhetorical @smoothpine, pretty much no (as @0x0936 points out in terms of new language). why the month timeline to learn?  (i.e., you may be  setting unrealistic expectations, that could affect your learning flow) a lot of pages do \\'are you sure you want to leave this page?\\' drives me crazy @jbmartinez some, really do, yes know it\\'s a different topic but i think it\\'s onbeforeunload. i always concerned about the potential for other things going on while dialog displayed, but it seems (by stackoverflow) that browsers add their own messages (to offset custom text) to mitigate potential security issues. was yeah, am on angular as well  i go back and forth with codecademy (they suck, they don\\'t suck) they do, however, have a lot of material @davidamandoestrada , yeah.... codeschool seems to have a very polished delivery on their angular course vs. ca good for you (that\\'s great)  @jbmartinez in a weird way, ca\\'s angular is better than their basic js different folks probably put that course together (i.e., apple to apples comparison within codecademy) @awesomeaniruddh , yeah i noticed that as well javascript code in basic js wp... shows up in left section (i.e., the code itself shows up around the red x or green) @jbmartinez doesn\\'t really bother me (provides a lesson in itself) although, gotta say... in a client situation, if they say (in essence) \"that\\'s confusing\"... then one would need to redesign   haven\\'t tried gitter on mobile. how do you like it @georgiel ? (other than it not autocompleting) ok, maybe need to revert to the plain text days.  --georgiel, how\\'s the mobile version working out? cool. will have to give it a try will be hard to format code on mobile i guess (depending on device) you could also, do speech to text. maybe the lags will cancel each other out. (although text to speech doesn\\'t always work too well) you can trim the random regex search (for bonfire wiki?), don\\'t think it would go by frequency lol are a lot of folks on the palindromes bf?  (haven\\'t gotten to that yet) oh, ok. i never seen that used as a verb. (wasn\\'t clear on your question). thanks @trickytiger, i know how to call a wiki entry, just haven\\'t gotten to that bf and was wondering the difficulty level  no problem, good try though. so, being between angular-land and going back over and redoing some of the existing waypoints...a question popped up (in my mind): is jquery implicitly referenced in \\'doc ready\\' function? you can download the framework etc., -but didn\\'t see any examples of referencing it in declarations. recursion -- codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1 and ms (yes, it ms but...):\\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/wwbyhkx4(v=vs.94).aspx so, nobody wants to field the implicit jquery declaration question? ms does a lot of stuff wrong; however, they do some things very well (why a ms vm will always have to be handy) probably my phrasing let me put it another way: is jquery magically (implicitly) called in \\'docready\\' function (just using that as shorthand)?  this would be similar to, say, custom fonts... you have to first point to the source (and then do stuff).  @arielleslie yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m saying... but jquery (at least from what i\\'ve seen so far, has some sort of transparent calling layer different from an actual html link (similar to fonts, libraries etc.) i think i just do the jquery download, and mess with their examples semi-locally i\\'ll ok, it doesn\\'t appear to be implicitly called found this on w3 and (of course) jquery\\'s site.\\n```\\n<head>\\n<script src=\"jquery-1.11.3.min.js\"></script>\\n</head>\\n\\n//note: this is not related to waypoints (it\\'s done automatically for you)\\n```\\n @tuniar there are some \\'services\\' that wrap the whole \\'make a website\\' thing into a paid, well service. but, you don\\'t need that... if you\\'re talking about production: it\\'s -domain name, a place to host rack, aws, etc., talent (you), stuff (your development) goes on the hosting site.  (but if it\\'s for learning purposes, all the other suggestions are sound) @arielleslie, thank you for the (ajax) link. provided an indirect perspective (though you can call jquery source script directly). the \\'full stack\\' part of things got me thinking about still more questions lol hey, the brownie point got cancelled out. try again: thanks @arielleslie  finally, yeah... that\\'s my understanding as well i wonder if when camperbot is ordering a hamburger (insert vegan whatever vegan alternative), does it yell in large font its order i refuse to use commas today @michael-krebs  cr** you\\'re right @arielleslie  you too well, (can\\'t actually go through a sentence without comma usage lol) must go back to the angular slog. got a gitter question: is there any way to tell if fcc rooms are active? (there are a lot of rooms, but a lot, literally, have comments >72 hrs) as last comment had no idea there were \\'empathy brownie points\\' lol welcome @dev-ans  when the convo is this slow, it reminds me of the aliens murmuring communication in the movie: dark city still trying to wrap mind around js closures... they make sense in a non-compiled paradigm with an exclamation it generates a camperbot greeting what\\'s your career path? or (desired career path) logic, and databases make pretty design work @willmead  do you think css and html make amazon run? @willmead but it\\'s, also, true if you website looks cra*** nobody will ever get to the functionality lol your that\\'s the intended purpose (or thrust from the curriculum ) i don\\'t think big ideas are necessarily connected with coding doesn\\'t hurt, but they\\'re not the same thing or coming up with a product that nobody knew they needed of course go linux i\\'m not crazy about apple\\'s os being tied to hardware i have to use windows vm for a lot of things (still). but linux is primary  i think there is some sort of giant mech robot tournament between us and japan that\\'s an odd pairing guess i\\'m going to have to do primer on coffeescript to get the ecmascipt 6 syntax that would crash stuff i would guess (or hope) that since browser is run locally any memory functions (done by the call stack hacks) would be caught at os level (i.e.., crash it) what changed? (i.e., there was a need to limit, now there\\'s not?) monday holidays make for ambiguous workflow hi, @abramcalhoun ... doing the  exercises is a good start @abramcalhoun imho, laptop will save you much heartache  100k (even with attrition) could be a driver for more non-profits (who knows?) my guess would be it\\'s difficult to gauge by login/streak etc., (sometimes you\\'re actively learning but on other sites (follow-up/reinforcement of concepts etc.)... @ashroulston those stats are (likely) really easy to gauge (as well, as number of exercises, etc.,) but, i too, am curious about long term @ashroulston not too shabby you have to set a manual fallback (via two size classes)? i thought, bootstrap was supposed to \\'automagically\\' resize (i\\'m not a bootstrap guru) @jedpimentel nice. i can see the utility in that for sure (makes me wonder if you can pass current \\'bootstrapped\\' rendering locations to js) welcome @mlichtenstern  @chocobowings , codecademy (yes, it\\'s an option) has an angular course too yeah, codeschool\\'s video/course delivery is very good @chocobowings , the funny thing (at least for me) is codecademy\\'s basic js course is so bad, that it almost soured any other of their courses (but yes, went back to ca as well) is/was @oopa  if you\\'re talking about gitter , i believe it\\'s in \\'appstores\\' for mobile, there are also, desktop clients for linux windows, etc. the fcc exercises,  (i believe) are generically web based (don\\'t know if there\\'s a mobile app) oh, you\\'re looking for something similar to fcc.  there are different categories (paid/free, etc.. ) etc., is that a suggestive \\'trick question\\'? (i.e.,  somebody should have such a blog?) include many cats in portfolio: nothing projects serious skills like cats. (yes, i\\'m joking lol) @ashroulston ,  it won\\'t work with dogs. only cats (they took over the internet long ago). @jbmartinez , oh no it\\'s actually...in fact, run by cats. so, the bonfire (s)... (and thanks, in advance camperbot) does \\'it\\' pass if the return value is valid (i.e., the route (your specific approach) can vary)? bonfire: thanks in advance @bk1995 , click within the black window (there\\'s more stuff below the typical line: you shouldn\\'t have to change code....) also, click the green run button twice  i have a vm that\\'s eligible for upgrade, however, i\\'m wondering if new windows is worth it my main os is linux @charis29 , it says they\\'re buying a whole lot of new volume licenses lol i\\'m not big on mandatory updates.  @benmcmahon100  btw, glad about the run button being fixed (quick bug turnaround) frankencode? wait a second here.... the green code buttons show the evaluation criteria for the bf, isn\\'t that in itself a clue? why not just setup a linux vm?  guess it\\'s a os preference thing. emulating linux seems more of a hassle than actually running things natively  lol opensuse isn\\'t a good distro for introduction (imho) go with something simpler like ubuntu @dannyfritz same here @lawlietblack if you install it (whatever distro, would recommend ubuntu though) in a vm the network connection is layered between your host machine and vm (it will present as a wired connection) so, in most cases you\\'re side stepping the nw card  true, you can bridge, etc...  dual-boot is better for performance, but if you don\\'t like the distro... then you have partition stuff that you\\'ll need to contend. (also, in that scenario... os is working directly with hardware, so you may have issues ) vms rule, (just be careful how much memory you allocate) @justaname94 , depends. if you\\'re running multiple vms (happens) then you have to factor what the host needs to operate comfortably. general rule (and some others may have better info) is to check the minimum requirements for your host (add a bit more) and the leftover for single/multiple vms  i like the \\'sandbox\\' element of vms as well i\\'d have to agree with @dannyfritz... ubuntu is well rounded (and easy).  one thing you have to watch for with some of the buntu derivatives is they sometimes don\\'t play nice with guest additions looks like a cairo dock if you wanted to retain the classic gnome look, you could install mate, and add a cairo dock (untested) over a vanilla ubuntu install, and it would work with guest additions without having to install headers etc. windows, actually, has been banished to its own vm... i still have to use it (yes, there are things that windows does well)... but i dislike it so @justaname94 awsome. glad it worked out. (i wanted to install bodhi (enlightenment) linux it sucked with guest additions @dannyfritz mostly database   than? mysql yes oracle? no hmmm, a lot of the sql examples seem pretty simplified. it helps to understand how relational dbs are structured etc. (which makes joins etc., easier to understand) - in the fcc course you\\'re actually doing mongodb which is not relational @dannyfritz , i do need to get with the mysql program as it\\'s the m in lamp (vendor syntax differences drives me nuts) @dannyfritz  those present interesting choices... looks like mariadb would be easier, but on the apache side that looks kind of interesting (if not painful) could it be that the image is nested in a column and row class? jquery, didn\\'t even look.... it\\'s late ha still slogging through angular angular (conceptually) is profound (still not there) so, here\\'s double brownie: thanks @lawlietblack  np... you\\'ll find that your windows os will be relegated to a vm eventually lol topic change: it seems, in some ways, that the coding (yes, by nature they converge)  aspect is easier than design.  @lawlietblack i don\\'t doubt it  make no mistake, if it\\'s (your project, site, app, etc.,) ugly nobody will ever get to the functiollity functionallity yes, but there\\'s not always equal strength in talent between the two pre made is a time saver... i kind of don\\'t like the generic look direction of various things design (not code structure) seems to take a lot of time for me (good ouput, yes subjective)  i agree on the balance thing for sure... you can take the reusable aspect of things and apply it to design (e.g., you don\\'t want to reinvent the wheel with some things when you\\'re pressed for time),  and maybe tweak things around the edges...  i\\'m glad text editors have the ability to collapse sections. all the css and jquery stuff can be hard on the eyes... reminds me of xml i just realized that it will be more than several hours before i can get a decent cup of coffee nooooooo that\\'s just wrong lol welcome @haribol007  @haribol007 , did you find having to say \\'h e l l o w o r l d\\'  kind of awkward? for cleaning tasks ? @happyconcepts  yes, it the first c program but still awkward when saying it in the real sense  vs. doing your first line of code awsome @psykobilliethekid  help coffeebot \\'you can do this\\' (without coffee) @yamaguchi59  are you saying \\'does it suck less during the day\\'? lol if you\\'re doing more advanced db work, backend language is not likely js java is more server side for database,  it\\'s not just mean stack with mongodb as you universe of choices...  i\\'d really like to learn python (or perl) but i feel like i\\'m spread a bit too thin still in angular land i can see how it rocks, just need to master it i can, also, see how kung fu rocks, but.... oh, camperbot... ever vigilante  with the (regex)  reminders  @mrzappy are you sure that\\'s all of the code? (don\\'t see a function declar) - the quotes, too (like mentioned) are problematic.  what wp is this? (looks similar to the old codecademy exercise) @jcadle we all feel stupid for a number of reasons.... you\\'re out of your comfort zone (that\\'s good) same here for me (and probably a lot of people) @mrzappy , i think there\\'s a bug in that codecademy excercise.  i passed that (what seems like eons ago, but not really) course and re-ran my code for that exercise and got the same error. maybe a cache issue? don\\'t know np ... i would eat coffee grinds at this moment. haven\\'t tried brackets but another user mentioned theseus js debugger...and must admit, it looks pretty cool  @abhisekp , is it worth it (i.e., is theseus nice in concept?)? i might check it (brackets) out... still love geany for its simplicity (and now sublime, sort of)  @jbmartinez , it\\'s really underated for some reason.... lol @abhisekp  yeah, geany is among default apps in smaller linux distros (doesn\\'t take a huge footprint and you can do builds etc) there was a spoof on kung fu movies (and the matrix effect) involving a kung fu cow  that\\'s funny.  missmannersbot i\\'d like to learn perl (don\\'t ask me why) i wonder if ruby would be a wide path around to get to some of the syntax elements if you have a deadline for (your) project, you should probably go with simple first @jbmartinez yep. for wrangling lots of files (text heavy manipulation) etc., perl seems to be a good fit (in addition to bash and various utilities)  @jbmartinez awk, sed... really handy... what do you find most annoying about perl? hi @markusm25  @jbmartinez , looking at a primer, (aside from the annoying \\'my\\' this and that) it sort of looks like js @clarkdh , access is not a good fit for a backend database (receiving traffic from web) so, a professor (heard on a ted talk) posits that \\'knowing anything\\' will soon be obsolete.  why am i doing these exercises again? lol yeah, i found the same paradox (questions) in this assertion you didn\\'t forget it @clarkdh ah, i see.... so it will be used as an export source (to something else) @clarkdh if i\\'m understanding correctly, you\\'ll need to transition to an enterprise level db at some point (if you\\'re talking dynamic access to the data (by said developers through apis etc.)) access is evil. fcc\\'s homegrown js wp(s) are better (in terms of annoyance factor) than (the old) codecademy exercises @jussjai, how are you liking the curriculum/exercises so far?   there\\'s a quick tutorial in git itself (top of page with the octopus/cat creature things at the top) should be a plus (+) sign at top right (and @dormouss makes a good point start with the wp first) of page wp = waypoints (there\\'s a map \\'button\\' in menu bar of fcc page) , see ya @dormouss  did you try accessing it with a new (assuming you\\'re using chrome) incognito tab/wind? lol, keep that excitement up @jussjai  @amanginc , yeah for complex stuff --it doesn\\'t hurt to copy your code into an editor (or run/fiddle in an editor or ide).. stuff can crash oh, that\\'s the problem: codecademy\\'s js tutorial is very confusing (poorly written (while other codecademy stuff isn\\'t bad) @wvmtnboy , yeah... i\\'m really tempted with python (and perl different route) but i think it would throw my focus off javascript (and the various frameworks) has grown into a serious language (not just for blinking cr** on pages like in the 1990s) although, there\\'s still a bunch of blinking cr** (it\\'s just way more complicated lol) welcome @peggywiltz  there should be a planet icon (to the right of search box), that takes you to the main list (although position can vary --) interesting (lua) don\\'t get the metatables thing metatables, mean something different to me, but i\\'m not grasping those in lua @catapixel , no.. but ask your question (am in angular land as well) are you pressing arrow down or arrow down (dedicated keys or shift on keypad)? @catapixel , i\\'m unclear on this as well (the video is a holdover from before)... it directs to codeschool, but i\\'m in codecademy angular as well. for me when i think i\\'ve grasped it, i\\'ll use the honor system, to mark as completed. (not much of an answer i know) @catapixel, i understand... i think (and i\\'ve probably said this before) that angular is profound...   the \\'modular\\' approach, sort of brings js into management concepts that i\\'m familiar did you get a water bottle? a sandwich is so much better than a stinken water bottle oh, that\\'s cool yeah, i was just going to say that got me thinking about rasberry hi @sbalcombe   @davidamandoestrada ,  that actually sounds fun.. on par with a star wars or star trek convention, but fun nonetheless  lol i don\\'t think they let you see \\'the real\\' google office. it\\'s probably some cardboard standup for tourists yeah, that needs a regex boundary it might match on: fishing troller (if you can\\'t spell trawler lol) when camperbot can self program, we\\'re all doomed @tyhandita yes i do, i believe camperbot left one of its arms back in time although, you know what...that just pointed up an inconsistency (well it\\'s a movie) if skynet was self-aware, why were the robots going back in time not?  i have neither. cra* all the hollywood stuff aside (or not), i was listening to some podcast with ai researchers. they\\'re not really trying to make things think like people (turing test) but better and different... lol, but wasn\\'t that sending a chip with your name to mars? (not actually, flying to mars... i think they would have an issue with all of the cheetos i\\'d have to bring along) well apple did its rollout recently, so semi-random  that\\'s how dynamic conversation works.... see? lol  (but, yes, apple\\'s pricing is like 90% profit) good for you (that\\'s great!) \\'tone\\' is sometimes hard to relate in text (but sometimes you have to use the dreaded exclamation) lol i have seen it overused in business communication throughout history xml hasn\\'t been completely vanquished (but i need to get with the json program) @progmacattack - so, you too have been \\'blessed\\' with a microsoft starting point (development wise)? (i.e., that timeframe) the date formatting thing is interesting, didn\\'t see any one-liners (or chaining).. most of what i saw was (web search) writing a function and grabbing different elements of date and combining) gmt, edt is for?  (i.e.,  why the workaround to produce desired format?) congrats @chocobowings ! @progmacattack ,  maybe the functions are acting more like classic procedures? (i.e., not returing a value) value room has strange convo-dropping-off timing: there\\'s like 50 million users, but goes silent - darn, @tommyizen just disproved the cost of living probably eats that up pretty quick though true, my guess is if you\\'re in house dev you may  or may not have the opportunity to be remote partially, yep. but the higher you go in salary (and you\\'re not a consultant), they\\'re going to want you closer to operation(s) location go linux @iheartkode, do you have to pay more for spikes in traffic, etc.?   looks pretty reasonable https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/ one is lucky if they\\'re maxing out their plan (and need to grow --ah, would be a good place to be)  i think the \\'.well\\' part is wrong @carl-parrish  if you apply the example (with particular (n)) in left pane, it should pass. (don\\'t know if it\\'s technically accurate in this case (n) = 2 what? the book recommendations are gone? i need to use scrapbook more often automatic suggestions/completion based on language all the api keys/pricing, at some point, google and yahoo added \\'software\\' to their lists of services. weird shift from the days of browser bundling lawsuits, etc.,  totally understand that. just say thanks thank you with @  in front of user name yes, @trickytiger this time. next time, you\\'ll type something quicker and beat me happens to me all the time people are lighting fast here bye but there are pauses (when people are not lightening fast) lol are you doing inline js? or with an external file are you talking about a fcc exercise (yes, 20 questions)? or trying from a page you built? ok, you may want to paste your code help formatting yeah, script goes above yeah, there\\'s no \\'doc ready\\' (also, doesn\\'t affect your exercise, but doc type/encoding goes at the top) @king0120  that looks good (although it snaps me back into the 1980s) it\\'s even faster than analog simon that kind of reminds me about css in general, i know the general \\'drag and drop\\' thing is eschewed, but when i\\'m trying to figure out positioning, it\\'s tempting (vs. code, run, check (repeat))   i\\'m running the same specs as @0x0936 ,  let me try too np, but when i select link directly it\\'s now timing out ok, now it\\'s running again (the background pic is loading). it seems on the successive same colors blips 1-4  like blue aren\\'t factored... i think (this is much faster than what i struggle to remember about simon game) not fairly, totally. welcome @larryya  oh, ok... i didn\\'t remember doing anything worthy of a brownie... lol i think there\\'s a free microwave at the end of the brownie-point path just joking then people will be saying: \"where\\'s my free microwave?\" lol @0x0936 , but it would be on the \\'weight watcher\\'s version of brownies which are tasty when you\\'re hungry. i\\'d take one now  something i didn\\'t know (and another user pointed out) is the gitter notification settings are -per room- (i.e., you have to be in that gitter room to change its settings: it\\'s not global) just in case anyone else\\'s email box gets loaded with automatic gitter cr**  that\\'s true. you (just) have to do it in each room\\'s (that you\\'ve accessed eg., youcandothis, etc.) settings\\n these card games... monochrome monitor? @drunkfurball, no i was joking (although you could make the font look like). these games\\' genesis was in mostly monochrome monitorville  @drunkfurball i knew that before you said it lol hi, @danger1300  i see the utility in the whole bootstrap grid thing, but was googling around for a way to visualize \\'the grid\\' (when editing) looks like people are applying some css/jquery tricks  if you\\'re in a *nix like environment you can also, run: locate seed.js  they\\'re doing inline css to make the lessons easier or internal styling to be more exact no pressure or anything lol how\\'s it going @iheartkode ? same here (though not rails) . taking break to reconnect with the nerd-collective lol are you doing an in-place upgrade? (noooo start fresh). oh, good... i was getting upgrade flashbacks  i\\'ve never had good luck with distro-upgrades (they take forever and (in my case) they\\'re always a little sketchy.). i just save home and start fresh... (but it too is a pita)   @ntpfun you\\'re not limited to fcc.... you can do different lessons, in tandem with all that is out there  yeah same here, five years of support (lts) is kind of my minimum. there are a lot of distros that have rolling releases @ntpfun , also, there\\'s lots of stuff beyond html(5), css  to get there (like js and the frameworks that go along in \\'the full stack\\'... more than enough to keep one busy) i tried mint too (not a bad distro), but ubuntu (with a kde) is the least \\'bs\\' distro out there imo (i.e., i can concentrate on stuff i need to do) i don\\'t know what i\\'d do without screen edges when i want \\'classic gnome\\' i tend to use mate @jkirch you had a bad interview experience? @jkirch that\\'s good (not the not getting part). if the post mortem is objective that\\'s helpful (sans beating yourself up over it)  now it\\'s \\'the language\\' yes the lol the is really dependent on context (of course i\\'m joking a bit)... if you\\'re doing front end stuff it\\'s safe to say that it\\'s a prerequisite  (i.e., js) i remember the flashing \\'this or that\\' in early webpages (as well as netscape). js has grown for sure.  @jurgenzz how was you angular experience? hey, @graysonhary  welcome @jurgenzz , angular is one of the things i\\'m learning (more in depth codeschool + codecademy), general thoughts on your experience learning it nice i\\'ve seen \\'no egg\\' / sugarless cakes in work settings i loved the modem that mathew broderick used (almost as good as the brick cell phones a little later in time lol) @michael-krebs , who needs instant info? with classic tech it only takes two weeks to download an   email lol forget star wars, if somebody told me that i\\'d have a device with no moving parts that could hold an entire music library, make calls, and search (the yet implemented internet) i would say: \\'uh, huh.. well, i need to change the batteries in walkman\\' hey @jbmartinez  oh, yeah, i forgot must master angular... i knew there was something it\\'s the modular part that attracts me to angular, are there other approaches (i.e., i think my brain is trying to square other language paradigms with js) google doesn\\'t seem to ask on a mobile device @jbmartinez  that\\'s the good part! (lol) i think it\\'s trying to put js into a modular paradigm (or bad depending on perspective) @jbmartinez hmmm, that does sound better (i.e., retaining more js type stuff pared with modeler approach ) what alternatives to you like?  were these rotten waffles? @jbmartinez i was going to go in sequence: angular, react .... now i\\'m curious about react (see how non-linear my learning is! lol) true yeah, it\\'s the space but i\\'m pretty late on the answer but bash loves spaces. (in fact, if you don\\'t place those correctly it will make big stink) and a powerful ally it is (refresh) wow, we were this close to having \\'refresh\\' being known as \\'random-dog-jumping\\' (the whole bug thing comes from actual bugs found in circuit boards) lol why is that a bad thing? (it\\'s not an error per se) fallback on ip maybe? here\\'s what i don\\'t get (i\\'m not on the weather exercise yet)... if user declines geo, why can\\'t the same approach used in js (with a lot of pages) be applied (i.e.,  random site works best with javascript enabled)? don\\'t know if the link given was the same as http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp this one is neat too https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/css/css_colors/color_picker_tool @mvr1976  i think the next thing is purchase of amway products but i\\'m not certain don\\'t quote me nice, you\\'ve got the planet down... it\\'s just a matter of working backwards at this point lol @mvr1976  just kidding. all you need to do is just start the lessons (if you get stuck, there are lots of folks to offer assistance here) (i.e., if your research on solving your problem doesn\\'t work out,  ask!) who needs city specific weather? i like entire planet weather better don\\'t change it weather really dominates this room (yes, it\\'s the weather app exercise generating...but, what\\'s up with that? lol) i feel i should be standing in front of a green backdrop pointing to patterns welcome @jenad1kr  good for her lol it is but it\\'s not limited to weather drivers\\' \\'visibility\\' is already bad. if you\\'re talking about motorcycle(s).... rain, just adds more to equation  @vinay1095 i think you can paste the codepen i would say work your way to node.js with the other exercises there\\'s a course map at the top of page (if you have fcc tab or another window open) @vinay1095 you may want to put the codepen link so users can evaluate (issue) the project output  omg ok, this is a scenario where invoking collapse is totally appropriate the coding part, (switching out colors on so many tiles) is cool. but, i\\'d have to say that the end result could be stroke inducing for some users. lol\\n @vinay1095 , great now that codepen is there... others can comment....  i\\'m not on this exercise, but the js (don\\'t know if codepen automatically references) isn\\'t referenced in html (script) portion... (there\\'s weather whatever but not the js you have) don\\'t know if that helps yes, we just didn\\'t know that arnold would reprise his role as an aarp member (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that, but hard to buy the \\'aged cyborg\\' thing) @cowfu true, but i think they are going to make him an actual t1 folks don\\'t generally tend to use celsius in nc  @thepeted , the get location from ip part is good pretty neat overall np @thepeted  i think that\\'s a great approach... you see a lot of questions (in fact, in the last hour or so) people getting stuck on user declining geo location @thepeted  was looking at telize (trying to work out their examples in my head) i heard that as well, not cool maybe the site isn\\'t mobile responsive wow, everyone gets a trophy (or in this case brownie points). ty @shifthawke  i\\'m sure camperbot says at the end of the day \"all of these regex firing tasks, and bonfire this, and bonfire that, and wikis-- there\\'s got to be something more\" lol i think the emperorbot (from return of the jedi) would be cool. sith lighting whenever a bonfire is referenced  so, there\\'s a bot hierarchy? and all the bots have the \\'hate on\\' for siri.  if that\\'s ingrained into ai were all screwed  we\\'re lol the \\'internet of things\\' (translated, the conduit for p*** off ai bots) lol yeah, i was thinking the same thing... pause, pause, and then another question = run you\\'ve got the marketing aspect down... one letter (or symbol like prince) simplicity is (actually) a great thing in design you could reverse engineer the fcc exercises, (i.e., the panels sections) are you talking about placing things into sections? (i too find scrolling forever kind of a pita) not cats again when cats and bots get together, then suspense ... ok, i got nothing no, not cats vs. bots cats and bots together,  like a really bad takeoff on the avengers thanks, camperbot. i didn\\'t want to read a full length article.  sounds like a potato-chip (albeit corn/cheese based) bot  actually, the \\'complaints\\' about camperbot are golden. it\\'s unedited feedback for those that do the programming on it.  which part? <checks connection speed oh, ok. i thought you were employing some sort of rhetorical suspense technique <checks that there is actually a connection hi, @gilbertcreations  verb lol on the fly \\'verb-a-nizing\\' is the best (especially when you\\'re in an work-audience situation) are you using firefox? (i.e., @genesisjoec ,  there are a lot of hits ranked in firefox order for recursion errors) dunno try it in chrome and see what happens @genesisjoec  just \\'think through\\' the examples that you find. i think you have to ask camperbot i\\'m super dumb and have no sense of humor  lol no, no... it\\'s true remember ruprecht from dirty rotten scoundrels? only thing missing is the eye patch  and triton   sadly no. you\\'re expected to retain all info in the first try. no practice lol of course (practice, practice, and practice some more) i\\'ve had to redo wp because i signed up right on the cusp of fcc moving to an updated curriculum. so, sort of not-really-mandatory-mandatory practice  do they still make tang (the \\'orange-ish\\' flavored drink)? you haven\\'t seen milk?\\n oh, i forgot @jbmartinez   well i still love tang (the drink) it\\'s good too.  cheap it\\'s choco flavored water made to look like milk and there are certain political aspects to some south american countries that makes familiarity with easily accessed milk and (things like yohoo) kind of problematic omg tang does still exist yes, i had to google it seems they have changed the packaging  i wonder if they changed the glorious 95% sugar crystals to 5% unidentified orange crystals recipe? oh, no... camperbot was invoked thanks (invoke again) @shifthawke  camperbot doesn\\'t like low-profile hats i remember those (hats) from the early 80s now they\\'re cool lesigh les sigh? yeah, yeah.... but to get that french sounding part i think you have to use les are you iterating over two arrays or trying to iterate over contents of 1st array? raises an interesting question (sorry for the side analysis) wouldn\\'t it be more efficient /explicit to do somearray.foreach   huh what kind of interview was this? lol also, it\\'s semi-transparent depending on text scrolling by for some sizes, it\\'s solid... for others it\\'s not... (clues?) @m6cheung , i think the interviewer is trying to gauge you\\'re ability to deal with ambiguity  was one thing about linux distros: hibernate is sometimes taken as shutdown completely (i don\\'t think i chose, \\'what to do when lid is shut?\\' well, of course shutdown!   what\\'s the list of errors? typos are so unforgiving thank the person with @ in front of name like this: thanks @jbmartinez  ok, what\\'s the question? also, terminal output is gold  the class convention is correct, but are there even any <i> tags in that wp? it\\'s the \\'all\\' of our buttons wp that has <i> tag, i was going by the title given...  lol yeah, i know @jbmartinez ,  the first execercise doesn\\'t have that element, (i was going by what was given)  common it trap lol grids yeah, val has no value is argarr undefined? no, i mean the index of .... , if you put a console.log statement in that loop it returns undefined maybe it\\'s late and i\\'ve had too many sardines i think their potential for bloating is some sort of karma wait, that empty val is called twice in that function i should have opted for tuna over a can (tin) of sardines implicit arg (val) being returned in the loop tuna and coffee (not in the same cup) hi, @amragaey  what\\'s the issue? (somebody will help for sure) or marginally sure careful with eval not knowing these concepts, i think argues against that kind of project at least in short term (not impossible, \\'when\\' is as good a question as \\'how\\') or not, code away with reckless abandon lol why? what\\'s the purpose of project? (i.e., sort of not defined = random takes on possible answers) oh, ok... i thought there may be a reason for vagueness  you know..  there are already online interpreters (haven\\'t really looked at those: i would just run locally ) ? why is there a hint call if it just redirects you somewhere else? \\nsheesh\\n @jbmartinez ,  oh, there\\'s no room specific context.... (no, excuse for not knowing... it\\'s all on git right? lol)  \\'fork it\\' don\\'t \\'wonder it\\' i guess lol same here (except for a passing lesson on that repo) @jbmartinez  i need to finish map as well first be humble, and be a new programmer badass comes later you\\'re already on your way @amragaey you ask questions what? being rolled for your dinner by your own dogs is pretty sad lol i remember the chijacks reference (because i was like what\\'s a chijack?) now i have knowledge that neither man nor machine can take chijack wow, i just caught an error noooooo do not invoke \\'it\\' (aka camperbot) you did @jbmartinez i think you understand lua\\'s history (not same country) better than a lot of folks  cats decide if they like you yes, dogs (potentially) will bite you if they don\\'t like you... with cats, it\\'s a little more subtle  yeah \\'bling\\' sounds like code wanting to be hip balancing media with media loop kind of like after eating chocolate, then eating some really salty chips (<--endorses healthy eating choices just in case non-profits are monitoring) i meant to say kind of like eating some apples and then some healthy tree nuts hmm ah, life without camperbot... scary thanks (free brownie points) @dting  oh, total cheap play for brownie points noooo i hate empty brownies .... it totally takes away from their intended purpose: helping argh yes, yes you are totally lol the conversation flow is dynamic... a technical question will come up, and the \\'flow\\' goes towards that yeah, you could have this (\\'flow\\') or 20 minutes of zero posts @mgm0136  avoid codecademy\\'s basic js course @mgm0136 , have you gone through all of the fcc waypoints in basic js? there are different learning styles... i think if one is too stilted; it may discourage new learners from asking a question.  if you grew up in the 80s or early 90s, you couldn\\'t avoid stephen king movies or hairspray there\\'s a jimmy falon skit i like the structure, but there are areas that could use improvement... (that\\'s true of anything, not to get all kaizen) he does that (or did that before gitting hit by a van) i think he was really seriously  injured in that accident @shifthawke stephen king was hit by a van (i think) sometime back i thought it was a vw van lol @djrunas , that is the question. i wonder, on average, how employers will value (i.e., as a process) the fcc cert (doesn\\'t bother me either way, learning a lot ....) there\\'s a modern take on that theme called \\'drag me to hell\\' (movie) sucked \\'drag me away from this stupid movie\\' is what i mistitled it  it\\'s like how do you forget the cursed button that the gypsy gave you  oh, yeah it was the bf in the movie who gave her the jacket hey, nice jacket doh! it\\'s ah, ah  \"what?\" a cursed button....that the gypsy oh, nevermind there was this stapler, ruler... and then... (it was a really bad movie) oh, that was bad both: rosemary\\'s baby and blair witch (overused consumer camera approach) that cinematography effect was adopted into a lot of other stuff (kind of like the matrix effect) yeah @jbmartinez  (i was like huh?) lol @jbmartinez  the effect of filming such that it simulates some person running around with a video camera. i.e., first person documentary effect there\\'s probably some word for it here it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shaky_camera the only movie that actually scared me (ok two) was exorcist and hell raiser wait i missed one; the orignal poltergeist original sort of implausible though: \"hey, honey look at this chair moving by itself\" response: \"oh, that\\'s weird\"... @julianaramburu they remade it? that\\'s true... it\\'s so annoying @julianaramburu will avoid it i hope not, then apple will get the idea to make the istomachpad (hey, they already did it with a watch) yeah, no idea i think that\\'s bad design (scroll forever,)  i like sectioned layouts or better yet, dynamic layouts!  (why i\\'m loving learning this stuff) that\\'s ok, mobiles will be laptop sized soon.  honestly, i\\'m all for nerdness but having a fricken tablet (aka what\\'s supposed to be a phone) in a holster , on your belt... makes you look...  it\\'s so within the realm of possibilty did they swap out obi wan? it was originally (in the prequels) the guy from train spotting wasn\\'t it elipses? there was a time when i could spell me too, the basic commands were at the bottom of the screen in these weird blocks when ibm wasn\\'t just for mainframe and they partnered up with this life sucking software company so, potential candidate... can you explain why you referred to us as a \\'life sucking software company?\\' what\\'s that @hugoender  that\\'s like applied (insert topic here). it\\'s hard to do theory you have a need (project) then the answer will come.  (at least for me) noooo @hugoender  two things would be working against you: 1. you\\'d be a new programmer and 2. you\\'d be desperate (stay employed while learning)  yep ok, not following the mouse like creature that attacks people have you tried dollar store? how do you know it\\'s a demonic mouse (as opposed to garden variety critters)? you should reason with it not as much no @smrum ,  although, you do get an external reference to codeschool for angular i can\\'t tell if somebody is grilling or my laptop is frying smells like classic bbq charcoal  or my laptop is about to go south try removing 4th ( @shifthawke what wp is this? https://github.com/rafase282/my-freecodecamp-code/wiki/jquery ```\\n// i don\\'t take credit: link is above\\n<script>\\n  $(document).ready(function() {\\n    $(\"button\").addclass(\"animated bounce\");\\n  });\\n</script>\\n\\n``` it\\'s like the outermost (although, some would disagree with my characterization of jquery) \\nfunction) see ya @jbmartinez  right next to the demon mouse lol nc has some serious wildlife possums are really not among nature\\'s most clever of creatures i saw something known as a humming bird moth (looked like a fricken flying lobster though) is there some reference i\\'m not catching (i.e., bob) i usually take it to mean \\'the bobs\\' in office space that\\'s so wrong and... there\\'s a possum named bob, so that makes it even more wrong lol who needs finite control over a silly thing like a cursor? lol\\n you\\'re too demanding oh, that sucks even more it\\'s useful for coupons....  you\\'ve just saved 30 cents! (shaking buttons) tell em what they\\'ve won bob that\\'s what i\\'d use it for (too good to waste on validation) oh, no @dcsan has taken manual control of camperbot lol that\\'s because he\\'s camperbot at the moment he\\'s the dev (yes, i\\'ve been pretty much dissing camperbot   all day) lol don\\'t know, but if you watch the monthly videos they usually have some of what (i imagine) the cor folks core they do the videos were on twitch i\\'ll be glad when flash is gone.  even with html5 you\\'re still dealing with containers/codecs (from what i read, it\\'s not as simple as bingo: now it\\'s html5) howdy @rasheinstein  like a car that requires lead gas but no longer is produced. how about you? i ate these sardines, (like many hours ago)  it renders differently. how\\'d you do that? (i.e., avatar #1 and avatar #2 magnified)  yeah, but i\\'m having a side convo seamless transitions are for polished fare... good ole hard break in topic is so much more efficient ugh, now me talk about this... (see how effective that is ?) lol you have to learn how to deal with (less than seamless) topic breaks... clients want what they want on their own terms (fast shifts for people with not a lot of time in the business world)  i made myself not do anything productive today (had to) so, i was on the fence... should i be a front-end dev or a hand model  ? you can\\'t do both no they\\'re hideous but, i can try you\\'ve crushed my dream of being a hand model lol that\\'s the spirit battery memory at near 0 capacity  there\\'s the bbq smell again, where is this coming from? who\\'s grilling at 12:00 am ? seriously, i\\'m checking to see if my laptop is frying something (sure smells good)  marinate some chicken throw your laptop over and voila! i\\'m pretty sure there\\'s no valkyrie\\'s ride playing in the background  well, hmmm... probably not the score to go along with my laptop frying some food (although, for the life of me i can\\'t find it...) somebody is grilling, but the smell comes and goes totally stumped wind is at a constant speed/direction that\\'s the problem: it smells great i think that was the first (proposed) star wars\\' prequel \\'phantom griller\\' didn\\'t get a lot of positive feedback i don\\'t know how these movie title formulas work, but using the force to grill a steak... seemed like a winner to me i think there\\'s a breakfast burrito now i like the simple sidebar template thing (reminds me of deprecated frames) it even has a toggle (side bar goes away)... simple but kind of neat  like if you have a whole bunch of content to manage global model is the enterprise at a whole what kind of entities are you trying to abstract into an er model?   @ironedr  this is something i once asked as well .. although there are relationships between different entities... there\\'s no logical universal relationship (i.e., the indirect tie-in)  to tie everything at the global level (i.e., yes things can be related because the designer wishes it so by saying \\'this is all at the global level)... i think what you may be getting at is this:  https://books.google.com/books?id=p8ldlywio9qc&pg=pa65&lpg=pa65&dq=what%27s+a+global+er+model&source=bl&ots=mxnh0gnqv9&sig=fsjpmubwct3avrtlc3cvxm2ph98&hl=en&sa=x&ved=0cfmq6aewcwovchmiplzxoy-gyaivxzeach0iga1j#v=onepage&q=what\\'s%20a%20global%20er%20model&f=false i see things as separate er-models, but can be grouped into an \\'enterprise model\\'. but there\\'s no logical join at least to me... oh, no not camperbot cr** the book might have just sucked in english as well can you really update a wiki (not can but should)? but, how does that work? (like consistency in content etc., ) what if drivers\\' manuals used the wiki approach this techo reference... (sorry a bit late) it reminds of (another) canadian \\'band\\' in the late 90s thanks @joepurdy  (that comment is golden and so true) free brownies for you (i\\'d give you more if i could) see ya @joepurdy  i have to laugh at the presumption that nc = whisky swilling folk question: how are the bonfires/ziplines evaluated? is it subjective? or is there some sort of benchmark hello @rayb0rn . code long and prosper don\\'t know why spock came to mind i was thinking about  a question that somebody asked about a js interview, and then spock popped in nope, just random star trek  see ya  don\\'t do that lol cause/effect @alan1001110 there are a lot of dev tools to deal with debugging js (beyond js console) help formatting unicorn rainbow? @kp950  paste between the backticks (they\\'re at top and bottom) i\\'m sorry @kp950 , i got sidetracked with unicorn rainbow.... (i\\'m still like: \"huh?\") you would overwrite your value in a loop @kp950 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/return the gyro effect (haven\\'t seen it in person) is the potential worst.... (one wheel off ground spinning at a different rate of speed, when it reconnects with the ground, flips bike) not the sandwich although tasty used to, yes  sportbike(s) and \\'standard\\' all in hondaville you\\'re very lucky did you hurl later ? what kind of old honda? mid 1980s? my motorcycle days (although i\\'d say you\\'re one for adventure if you\\'re riding anywhere close to dc metro) are behind me i had to (at one time) drive a non-two wheeled vehicle in that area most of the time at a standstill... but not the best drivers in the world lol lol i totally forgot, @rbunz08 the page looks nice (i didn\\'t test the functionality though) when you\\'re riding, you become very attuned to what\\'s going on in the driver\\'s (car) mirror (you can almost just tell when somebody is going to swap lanes without signaling )  and never sit in the middle of the lane at a stop. always on the edge left or right, so you can throttle  out when some a **** is looking down at their phone bye @kp950  hmmm @tzahile aside from fcc,,  you may want to consider copyright  issues i\\'m going to give you answer (without even looking so, it could be wrong) - there was a portfolio example with image that scrolled by a min ago wait, you\\'ve totally changed your username lol lol @tzahile ,  ok... what\\'s the issue again? (i see all the individual images (as well as the background) rendering in the codepen @tzahile a couple of things: 1. if you\\'re saving a file locally (and referencing it locally in the tag that could be problematic) 2. when you say \\'thumbnail\\' are you talking about facebook type of stuff (when sharing a link for example)? anybody ever used a coffee warmer? (you know the cheap disc with a pad thing you usually see around the holidays) coffee = coding fuel pros? cons? i suppose you could put whole beans (into said spirit) for something exotic what reference did you use to get to the site? ok nvm.... that is the site.... looks great didn\\'t test it (not (potentially) bricking my phone) lol yeah, i\\'m looking at the page source now i went to the link www.materializecss.com, i\\'m liking this simple stuff like putting <li> stuff</li> into a button neat ideas thanks @kinginthenorth i\\'m bookmarking this nice the other background was better i think i remember this from a day or two ago there weren\\'t penguins? are you sure? lol seriously, i do remember this layout.... the first was better imo do those cancel each other out?\\n that\\'s true too, localhost... but, what  i\\'m wondering can you have more than one reference (i.e., multiple versions) very nice... i like the easy access layout of the projects (and the post demo \\'let\\'s work together\\') and that animation is pretty cool how come 60fps (video runs between 29.9 and 30) ? (depending on quality.. i remember some formula for human perception of motion (i.e., animation) i forgot what it was but  was well below even video i remember macromedia sad lol so, i\\'m looking at the comparison (30fps vs 60fps) the 60 frame looks sharper, but i\\'m not sold on whether that has to do with frame rate. the \\'motion\\' looks the same make sure they\\'re thoughtful questions keep it short main points, don\\'t (for pete\\'s sake) read the questions or tell them how you\\'re going to make their products less sucky no, @buzzlightyear90  know the questions....  if you familiarize yourself with something, you\\'re not memorizing it (per se) you know it.  and that shows (vs. reading off questions which, personally, i wouldn\\'t be as impressed with) @buzzlightyear90 don\\'t spend too much time on that part, (yes, yes, they want to know if you\\'ve done your research) but -- they want to know if you\\'re competent and would be a good team fit here\\'s a simple question to ask: \"what is the most immediate problem that needs to be fixed/improved\" -in x team, x product, x process etc. ,  most of this stuff (animations and the like) is \\'use with care\\' imo... i personally, dislike sites that employ a lot of media, (and its effect on whatever hardware) not saying i\\'m immune to it (\\'hey, that\\'s cool, gotta use that), but if it pi*** off user (or detracts from the service/goal) then .... same here, how\\'s the rent in new guinea? got google translate (what possibly could go wrong?) lol why sinatra? do you know thai? yes... sounds like a bad plan ok, this is good.  what if you lose your laptop (or other device) and don\\'t know how to speak thai (or the front code that you\\'re learning)? back end dev (or administration) is good stuff @thec0mposer , to some extent that\\'s true; (not necessarily day to day).  i don\\'t apply a bohemian ranking to technologies though lol @shifthawke why sour? hi avengerabinash grr @avengerabinash  it is monday that\\'s a reasonable amount of \\'suckyness\\' on any day  there are a bunch of simon game sounds (out there) you could sample a clip with audacity (or equiv editor for os) @dealpete , that\\'s an interesting question, (i\\'d like to add audio too) if you look at the other pens, some folks put an external link (which is what you\\'re asking, how/where to host) to file. maybe there\\'s a \\'ready to go\\' clip you could link (to)?  (i\\'ve also, seen, that you can try to get/put resources in  git but haven\\'t done it) some for sounds (i just did a search) http://codepen.io/tag/sound/ i don\\'t think dropbox would be good for that (anything resembling hosting of resources), you\\'d have to share folder, no? was thinking the same (one shouldn\\'t have to go all over h*l* and back) just to link to a sound file weird markup: ok gitter... hell and back but h + forward slash works too *don\\'t think it\\'s the italics* lol aws is utilized a lot with a lot of serious production stuff  i\\'m thinking about aws,  i think @dealpete \\'s dilemma (what to do when you need your own hosted resource) is instructive if you span it out a bit to other things that sucks, that would have been perfect (which is why it must be deprecated (no revenue))  no kidding lol...  aws, is looking better and better: (in low tier) it\\'s an infinitely better investment than running a local server (forget that)  @arielleslie (i think i\\'m imprinting subjective stuff to the joke, which makes it more humorous)    i remember (kind of tangential, yes) you mentioning cloud9, looks like they work/partner with heroku (wonder if that would be an option) there\\'s some good \\'ubuntu-ness\\' there (totally sidetracked now) yesterday it was materializecss now cloud9... there are so many good examples/suggestions here... am totally all over the place! lol looks good @levyian , but it won\\' let me switch to celsius (not that i\\'m a big fan of celsius)  hmmm well, it was a \\'draggable\\' control... so, drag? this feature (calling bf details from camperbot) is like reading a phone book (at one point in humane experience we had these big paper things with phone numbers) out loud i\\'m not in italy.... but yes, it\\'s working (the control is clickable but looks like slider) not being picky (it looks good) there was an example of a fallback to ip location that i saw for this weather app. very clever. . i think the permissions that different services request (geo, blah, blah) are magic twinkies (i.e., dialogs with messages to give you the illusion of choice)   lol no, but actual twinkies would be great  looks like a string the mist was good mdn (i know there\\'s a lot of \\'round the way to get there\\') has it as new boolean(false); is it a matter of preference? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/boolean are you talking about alkaline levels? lol (sorry, never saw camel case applied to php) disquiet reminds me of movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/ dark city (actor rufus something, something) it is bad *** .  great movie @mrhormonas , what was the question? (i think i missed it, maybe can\\'t answer it, but don\\'t remember it) it\\'s a great movie i was trying to say that it was bad a^^ here are some brownies (they have no value in bangkok): thanks, @thec0mposer   what\\'s weird (though not helpful) @mrhormonas you have more rows (yes they\\'re undefined) appended than what\\'s in your user array @jerometorno i\\'d center the text more the div with the gray background with thin black border,, \\'i\\'m a developer, etc..\\'  the text is hugging the left side i love how fall just drops in. it\\'s freakin cold all of the sudden well, i guess it\\'s hot  what\\'s \\'it\\' ? it\\'s still cold weather that is,  (all this thermodynamic talk) lol well, @lawlietblack it\\'s not so bad, but the sudden shift is lame like, ta-da: it\\'s fall but then tomorrow it could,  easily, be 90...  don\\'t forget regex  and/or .split that\\'s a really bad photoshop of kanye (i hope, if not scary): his head doesn\\'t fit his body (which you could argue is his overall issue) wait, are you using github to sign in or was your last login before fcc switched curriculum?  @hannekoppelman  you have to delete one of those accounts (there should be instructions at the login page) you\\'re progress is still there help sign in grrr, or was it help accounts sigh hey @camperbot (dcsan) ; what\\'s the wiki entry for the login issues for folks that signed up pre-beta? emoticons are pure evil (thanks unicode) very nice @chocobowings  i know people that \\'speak\\' in nothing but emoticons camperbot does seem to invoke that a lot hello, microsoft  your automatic activation # failed again,  let me go through my life story  oh, yes, i can help you i think camperbot said that you could only use bezier curves. as it (camperbot) declared rectangles to be banned. (its cruel like that, all the ai power and all) lol ducking lol i didn\\'t know the term palindrome prior to fcc this explains david copperfield i always wondered what it was wait there\\'s actually a meaning to that kansas song?  i\\'ve never considered palindromes to be that important to my understanding of the universe radiohead = good stuff toto = sum cr^^ that always came on the radio after eddie money i saw them before bssm came out. they were still edgy (a far cry from lip syncing their nfl appearance)  @danstockham he was bad in jane\\'s addiction brain stew, simple  great song merpeople (fish?) wasabi cher? ok please,  before another random list of songs go by,  ask your technical question @codefiasco , post the code help formatting code sandwich: paste (your code) between the backticks i\\'m going to use this cool feature called colapse ah, life better i think chris farley almost was neo, but they chose keanu  deer are big rats you drink the vinegar, then curse the deer? i mean that could be effective these are some rather unconventional gardening tips you could play cher (on of your list choices) over loudspeaker. i\\'m sure they\\'d run like hell one of yes, js fundamental to stack i can see the deer now.... \\'no, that garden is a no-go\\' they\\'re playing cher... \\'what are our options, then? well we can starve) lol i\\'m getting used to js....  (and its \\'laid back\\' paradigm good/bad) codecademy\\'s basic js is bad (like shi^^y bad) codecademy\\'s angular = good  ,  codecademy\\'s basic js = bad no lol different usage/application js isn\\'t the right tool for everything cats when in doubt, cats no liear liar the original i am legend (was, a 70s version called something else) it was funny plus is also a concatenat(or)  confusing counter with index? yes, but you\\'re wanting to skip the first (n) elements in the array the regex (and all of its different variants of \\'thanks\\') for camperbot, should include an explanation of why (if you want to thank somebody)  --   @arielleslie same here, (it\\'s kind of an ai version of butting into somebody\\'s convo).... but it should be less vague if it\\'s going to be rude lol i don\\'t do a lot of gaming, but \\'gaming\\' psu are great for any tower you can run linux off an external drive, but not windows (technically) same here,  (confused) what\\'s the intended gain from an external? the (most notable) performance gain with ssd comes if your os resides on the ssd with the ssd, you\\'re going to (also) want more memory (not related, but more of a \\'while you\\'re at it\\' type of thing) what it doesn\\'t do: spin ouch. 1tb pricey.... you could get a smaller ssd for primary , and some cra^^ cheaper drives for storage  lol than ssd drives? most towers (standard) have at least two bays some have more.... (you can also, go external) oh, laptop nvm you\\'re sc^^^^^ed yes very warner brothers i could count carets (which is the actual spelling) ^^^^^^^ mountains hmmm asterisks are reserved gitter formatting chars that looks like an inverted album cover of simple minds: don\\'t you (forget about me) bye @ashiantfb  they have \\'gaming\\' laptops (they\\'re insanely expensive though) get ready for more bloat (no user intervention for updates) banished windows to vm long ago at least on primary machine your os may revolt when referring to it as such lol you may find \\'cortana\\' greeting you with \\'i heard what you said about me\\', so i just decided to a fresh upgrade to your system lol, yes... banish cortana\\n\\n ms is marketing their office products to other platforms, i wonder if they\\'re a)realizing that their os market share is slipping or b)they\\'re betting that they don\\'t need (said office products, which i would argue, is the reason a lot of orgs keep windows at the desktop level (there are other, good, ms offerings though) you should be more clear in your feelings about the tutorial @joepurdy agree, there\\'s also the volume licensing  i think you\\'d get more (positive) feedback to your question if you explain what aspects suck (then that could help gauge what you\\'re looking for in terms of alternatives) i\\'m jumping ahead a bit but an example (one of the pens) got me thinking about json.... you can \\'walk through\\' json stuff but what\\'s jquery \\'wrapper\\' for this? i.e., basic high-level that\\'s a pretty healthy self assessment  it\\'s easy to get sidetracked with all of the technologies\\n i think the demise of the laptop is a bit further out... yes i still remember the laptop ah, the original thinkpad nice not only is that thing not forgotten, it\\'s sought after grandma has good taste the cloud is based on hardware, just somebody else\\'s... argues against not having consumer hardware so, sensei  tell me about bootstrap again  sarcasm lost hi @srlhyo  @zersiax ,  what kind of fix? (sounds interesting)  no he\\'s not or \\'its\\' it just does that to mask its real intelligence  lol bots don\\'t recognize brownie intent lol hey @jbmartinez  that is awsome @zersiax , accessibility in design is an important aspect to things js, jquery, angular ...will be fun @srlhyo  speak softly carry big font help formatting i use  code sandwich backticks are the bread, code is the turkey. hand model or wannabe hand model there\\'s too much competition for that kind of modelling  @dasgingy paste what you\\'ve got so far don\\'t do it it\\'s like being sam in the movie ghost that was quick, code then no code @semachka bring the code back nobody ever listens to the fish-eye-dude...  troutman was a lesser known dc superhero retiring from modeling? i\\'m waiting for the day the camperbot says: \\'you know what? i\\'m tired of handing out brownies\\' lol yes, there\\'s a planet icon at top of screen i like multi-city wiki tuna recipes sigh oh, well... i guess i\\'ll have to go back to traversing json @jbmartinez  i think so too one can\\'t live on code alone (which is where the tuna recipes come in... ) not if it\\'s a portal to other services @jbmartinez  or, a static login page wait, nvm if it\\'s a static login.... more centered and less nav would be good angular says the check is in the mail i\\'m learning it too @mrhormonas did you try outputing user.data into console (or alert) to see what you\\'re getting? nvm alert bad (very) in a loop.... you\\'re pulling it from json no? with @jrchandler i don\\'t the answer.... maybe it\\'s your list variable that\\'s calling divs without a specifier ? (i\\'d like to know answer too) np @jrchandler  if i had known nothing other than js maybe i\\'d have less issues with js wow, that\\'s some bad stuff (malbroge) good grief if you say lurk it takes away from the stealth factor oh, got ya i don\\'t dislike js.....  i think there\\'s a plus sign out of place lol it\\'s like a bit of everything thrown in without the rules (js).  the things you can\\'t do in other languages throws me off when \\'js\\' mode cool ok, it\\'s cool (literally) again... ok, fall... are you coming or not? (stop messing with me already, darn season) where\\' s the love for angular? i\\'m trying to learn it, and everybody hates (or close to) it is angular a good entry point into frameworks(s) (i.e., yes... it can \\'suck\\' as a day-to-day tool, but does it have some conceptual elements) now i feel bad for angular (in an anthropomorphic kind of way)  i feel like i need to go angular before react.... (i can guarantee that i\\'ll be looking over react docs before the week is out) that\\'s a good motivator someone mentioned materializecss the other day, i looked at the page, it can turn static buttons into <li>stuff</>  to be honest, i liked the whole materialize thing but if i have to do windows95 then i will if you have a righteous hamburger then i\\'d say yes the codecademy course is not written well.. yes, it doesn\\'t hold your hand... and yes, it doesn\\'t maintain consistency in examples or logic either they should market camperbot bobbleheads  i know you\\'re envisioning it  lol  that\\'s so wrong yes, camperbot... how do you feel about bobbleheads with your likeness? i\\'m somehow envisioning laser cannons (camperbot\\'s undocumented hardware) powering up. lol dots have a more atari feel what? no batman either no way if you feel like batman, then you\\'re batman but batman is not very conversational i still think my troutman (or troutperson) idea is better than the current crop of superheros  are catwoman\\'s eyebrows part of her mask? why does that version of catwoman have pirate boots i would say while is not a good approach...  lack of input is the natural state  of things bye what\\'s the salad dressing with a lot of anchovies ? the 0 value after % is confusing (non-standard?) hi @ng-martin  can\\'t you omit? @jbmartinez  always, stingy with the keystrokes  lol i was looking at mdn just now,  css is fun like a root canal @ng-martin  there\\'s no queue ask away use incognito tab to access eat much oatmeal sugar cookies are the best (without all the c^^p just plain) sugar cookies are like sashimi, coffee, and news (best served right away)  i think @julianaramburu is on to something: sure it\\'s not \\'get\\'? forismatic\\'s (api) callback function example(s) are in russian i gathered that @michael-krebs (lol) what did you break? oh, cr^^ @mansour-ahmed that\\'s in the (padded) request, i\\'m talking about their example documentation @oab00\\'s example is closer to what you need (based on all the examples, i\\'ve seen) i don\\'t know but i think if you leave the callback empty it\\'s suppossed to auto generate,  and other examples state that you\\'re going to need the callback (yours, defined) to parse the return data  touchscreens on laptops noooo laptop screens are supposed to be pristine not all gunked up with fingerprints and ramen powder my favorite, is people leaning over a desk and touching your screen \\'you mean that, thingy there?\\'  i think that\\'s where you define a callback to parse all that stuff that @joepurdy  is listing that api seems a little sketchy @joepurdy makes me wonder if question a) should be: should i use this api (vs. how do i use this api) when doing some of this stuff lol ?? now it\\'s cold again.... southeast @joepurdy same here, i saw it in an example of somebody\\'s codepen i\\'m nowhere near the beach do i wear flannel or not? weather, please be consistent what happens (here in nc) is it\\'s chilly, then one wears flannel. then it gets hot all of a sudden-- then one ends up tying said flannel around waist... then one looks like an extra from a 1980s skid row video depends  paste \\'th the code \\'th it shouldn\\'t matter because it\\'s enclosed in quotes, but oscar wilde\\'s quote has a semicolon  @luishendrix92  has a clean version of example, but your question @itch96 was what does error signify (the original post\\'s copied version had all kinds of junk... i\\'m going to go with the semicolon.. who\\'s with me? lol) @luishendrix92  you may need to escape that character yo coding while distracted is not as bad as all that stuff  lol are you really? i think i have some work to do, one dumb question before i go:  can you edit (displayed instance) of codepen examples that are posted without messing those up? (i.e., am assuming since you\\'re not logged in as the poster, any changes would be browser session based)...  hey @jbmartinez  and thanks @michael-krebs  ah, the regex doesn\\'t discern that\\'s funny, @jbmartinez  no problem... one t h a n k s in string is interpreted to apply to all user names in string  i was so close, to getting some work done jif is the best @thedigitalmonk i like the \\'moving background\\' now i want jif jif is evil, i\\'m sure i could eat a whole jar < 24 hours welcome @noobdeveloper22  free trials should be without caveats  like, it\\'s free but we want your cc f that apple and google are morphing into what ms was historically yeah, @jbmartinez  i think eu folks are suing all over the place there\\'s a converter that you can swap out an old dvd drive with an additional hard drive (a lot of things don\\'t have a dvd drive) firefox still has the best dev tools (imo) chrome is fast (i use it) but for dev ff still rocks  i don\\'t like apple\\'s \\'ecosystem\\'  go linux @thedigitalmonk  apple is if i choose to use their hardware... the choice really is subjective, (a lot of folks who use apple aren\\'t aware they don\\'t have so much \\'choice\\') lol @jbmartinez  @thedigitalmonk that includes their products like music  ubuntu is awsome install it in a vm give it a go @lawlietblack you need to give your guest more memory what kind of desktop? unity, kde? i used to do conky config files love em when using puppy linux back in the day loved kubuntu is great  i do too, (although i get all gnome ish sometimes , and switch to mate) screen edges you\\'ll never go back that\\'s wrong lol you can recycle old hardware with linux (some distros are better than others in terms of \\'weight\\') this is great for getting folks \\'plugged in\\' no love for perl? lol you can apply the same logic to perl vs. python although, not tasty i\\'m going to learn perl  i am yes lol that\\'s why it\\'s useful lol having a command (no pun intended) of an esoteric language is righteous  i promise not to gouge my eyes out with bananas oooh i am undeterred by the completly insane loop logic of perl was looking over some syntax examples, now i can\\'t spell  i wonder what many hours of perl syntax will do to me hiya @stinger25  i think it\\'s the time of year that\\'s a great song i didn\\'t play it for fear that it would be like mr. roboto (never ending chorus loop in my head) multitasking  @danielmw34 you may want to paste your code full code...  help formatting code sandwich = backticks are the bread code is the turkey that\\'s what i finally settled on, (i used variants with hamburgers, but tried to adjust for vegans (even though turkey isn\\'t , well , vegan) backticks are the bread code is the lettuce? ok, nvm.   the regex is looking for all the whitespaces then the count (looks like) is performed on the number of whitespaces on the returned \\'string\\' via length if i have to go gluten free, my bread example is going to fall apart hmmm you might get \\\\t (tab)  but yes i think that should work... could be wrong though just based on your question (not taking into account any requirements) @gaindacode , look at different examples... questions that people pose, it begins to make sense (i say begins, ) and yeah, code some stuff... and.... always make sure your coffee is warm i\\'d still drink it (not preferred but you do what you have to) i made the mistake of trying to think of js objects of in terms of class (this always makes for interesting reading, i already know this is wrong (in thinking) but i had to go the route of namespace too) hi @tiffberryman  welcome to you too @hambacneggs  now i want bacon, thanks lol i wish i could get the vision of ham and eggs (darn screen name) out of my mind. some really good over easy eggs,  (i wasn\\'t kidding lol)   i love the key clamps at home depot (\\'not for climbing\\' imprinted ,  i\\'m like yeah, no kidding) that\\'s my favorite too, (and the international graphic on a lawnmower of foot in blade)....so, many product warnings in a highly litigious society (or societies)  nooooo i just got over ham and eggs where are the coding questions? aren\\'t there like 50,000 people here right now? lol ^where are the semi-reasonable coding questions i don\\'t understand the pauses like yes, most folks are multitasking (e.g, working, doing waypoints, cooking eggs) but there are these long periods of inactivity (with a huge number of users) pretty much all except the eggs which i\\'m really wishing i could do now don\\'t bale on angular  lol would that be ansi c or c, c? c is interesting for its fine control of memory... have a c book, sometimes am tempted to run through it i am and that was the next thing @curlifair  @shifthawke i\\'m pretty much limited to bojangles at the moment yeah i want eggs, but not a cup of oil poured over then i have to get moist towelettes (which guaranteed there will be none left)  sure, @arktikh  i\\'d first narrow it down to the language that you\\'re most interested  then look for conventions, (coding is too broad) humility? just kidding maybe api familiarity   and maybe by extension problem solving skills (i.e., what to do when geo is declined) and update it manually too not weather, but i\\'d say the quote api could go on that list actionscript3 in download prominence seems kind of weird (and language support for examples, is another) ( something tells me this an inherent quality in \\'no key\\' apis) nooo i think camperbot also goes by other names no, i think his (camperbot) other name is beelzbub lol yes, now we\\'re bickering over electronic brownies (bitcoin doesn\\'t seem so crazy now) get 100 more and you get a free  microwave popcorn pouch are you running it on virtualbox or vmware? i leave for an hour, and convo degrades into brownie points and ascii art wtf?  lol ^^^^ (((( sorry, trying to go with the flow i don\\'t either are you saying (begrudgingly gets pulled into emoji convo) that there are undocumented emoji? like easter eggs of emoji in gitter  you could also check if the unicode (code) will render in gitter markup `u+1f608`\\n u+1f608\\n <p>this a test &#1f608;<p> crap <p>this a test &#1f608;</p> lol  can i only use \\'gitter markup\\' ? nice try to use camperbot as an html formatter lol 😈 i barely pass the turing test i hate copy/paste (too easy) i want to directly render a friggin unicode  now i\\'m so pi^^^d. who started the emoji topic?  lol no, they are not sufficient the fact that there\\'s a limited set of options, makes one want more you\\'d have to have a jet car yeah, i even tried a different variant it can also mean that you\\'re calling a function that hasn\\'t been declared like renderthisfrigginemoticon() ```\\nvar somestring = \"bob\";\\n``` yep\\n but careful with implicit conversion one of the js \\'gems\\' sorry somestring lol it\\'s like a camel meacamel it makes variables easier to read (i\\'m lazy) i use all lowercase to make things interesting and left justify  python folks love that  lol are you using fcc or some alternate learning site  you\\'re right (about the waypoint) i do that constantly (snake case) i have to keep myself from using underscores in subject lines long subject lines with reserved  characters drive me crazy (i see it all the time) @joepurdy i wouldn\\'t doubt it ladder @stinger25  huh? was it the ladder joke? then there\\'s svn to do (technology) list keeps growing it\\'s like a giant cat like 500ft tall cat haven\\'t watched the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xpnkhjaok8 it item# 596 on my list it\\'s honestly, high level (at conceptual level) talks help me more in some cases  so, the quotes/weather examples (api stuff) have got me thinking about jsonp (i realize a lot of this is limited to \\'get\\' vs. \\'post\\') but what\\'s the widespread usage/applicability of this (jsonp) given some of the security implications?   @0x0936 , i think you may be on to something... full flannel day. i think it\\'s fall at least for another hour, then it will not be but, it will not be freezing in an hour heads one = is for assignment btw but your lesson could fail on the string comparison \"head\" vs. \"heads\" too @shakejunk  syntax errors (and typos) are really a pain: you essentially have a cyborg english professor (that is ever vigilant and doesn\\'t make mistakes) checking your code when you hit submit  @pkneeland78  can you post the link to that waypoint? so, here\\'s a hint: you have some missing elements in your addclass declaration btn-primary should (at least in my case with the exercise) should appear (separate by spaces) in each .addclass along with the other stuff @julianaramburu lol it\\'s really sensitive @julianaramburu, i\\'ve had to pause my \\'return finger behavior\\'   @pkneeland78  so, what was the final resolution? hi, @stuartbridges  every time i see/hear the word \\'noob\\' (or its variants) i think of p. cox from scrubs or \\'newbie\\' are you looking for a custom date format? (i.e., without the gmt)? i don\\'t \\nknow of a simple built-in function but here are a couple of links: 1.\\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3552461/how-to-format-a-javascript-date,\\n2. don\\'t hate on the ms (it\\'s just an example) https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff743760(v=vs.94).aspx the auto formatting added 1. to the indentation regex is awsome cryptic but seriously powerful regex + sed was a very profound thing when working with large text/data files... (at least for me) stream editor (linux or *nix like) yeah, regex is (and am no guru) is language agnostic @julianaramburu , turn brain off and fake it @julianaramburu http://www.regexr.com/ and https://regex101.com/ the second link is particulary handy. @ami190  that\\'s a whole cadre of separate (but related) items, what are you installing specifically? @ami190, don\\'t know about the link (or even what operating system you\\'re using), but there are a lot of things (like dependencies, etc.,) that are probably beyond the scope of this help (channel?).   @ami190 , i would first narrow your search to operating system, if you\\'re on linux... there are tutorials out there. my guess would be that you\\'re second search block would be specific to help with dependency issues (search this broad topic by some of the linux boards)... you\\'re essentially installing separate components etc..   backend does have design aspects, it\\'s more behind the scenes and not immediately perceptible to the end user    @ami190 that sucks. linux has a better approach to resolving dependencies (but not always trouble free if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing)... you could try installing your stack into a vm depends on what backend you\\'re talking about @burressdesign i have to agree yeah, i know it sounded kind of odd. anything with \\'backend\\' in it has the potential for jokes   see like that wrong (funny, but wrong) lol here\\'s the thing, take amazon (this is my fav example) it\\'s not the front-end that drives its functionallity or usefulness hey, i\\'m earthbound too. (we have so much in common already) btw, hey @thiagoferreir4  haven\\'t seen you around in a while i\\'m glad you got a gig! @thiagoferreir4  they\\'ve since (also) put your name as an example on one of the exercises... so, now you\\'ve got a gig and you\\'re a rock star...  (don\\'t be like elvis take it in stride lol) what joke ? oh, this is good uh, huh though i make fun of camperbot, ai (actual) is something that i\\'m interested now i\\'m think of weird al yes, there\\'s like a 100% chance that this room would get that reference to weird al lol it\\'s a take off on riding dirty that weird al did .... (funny as he^^) takeoff  @burressdesign , i wonder that too (about the formatting) weeeid ahhhh i meant weird see what you started @shifthawke  oh, it\\'s an evil gitter thing oh, you typed it alright lol codename har ahr he actually was complemented on his rap skills in that spoof  klingon  rolling just remembered that part i\\'m so close to youtubing this again (when i first saw it (way back) i watched it over and over) @qmikew1 karma, karma, karma, chameleon  yeah, it is a neat featur e boolean is true or false (or 0 , 1) what context is the length aspect? (i.e., it wouldn\\'t be applicable unless there\\'s some additional thing that you\\'re doing (not described)   which wp? you\\'ll find string length very applicable (it\\'s a basic handy thing) to a lot of stuff on the flip side isnan will be handy too i need coffee  like now that would be the coffee size that i want and answer..... \\'no idea\\' i sold my soul to starbucks long ago it was at these old crossroads i thought it was soup i\\'m like what the he^^ is that oh, marshmallows.... (i seriously thought dumplings) there is the  righteouslycomplexwheather.js api that you could use camperbot\\'s fallback is to give brownie points.... when it gets into awkward situations it goes: \"um, yeah... here\\'s a brownie, let\\'s move on\" lol that\\'s one of the things about ai (camperbot isn\\'t (it\\'s more regex parser as @0x0936 points out), there\\'s an infinite amount of subtly that ai can\\'t deal not directly related but i tried wrapping my brain around: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuzzy_logic - a few years back around the same time as weird al\\'s epic video i was just thinking that while looking at my paragraph (i.e.., invasion of the body snatchers screaming \"nerd\"!)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gestsljzhzo hey @jbmartinez ! polar opposites: kirk and picard what do you mean download? (i.e., you can copy pagesource, or if you want, there are tools that can save html/css/images/js like scrapbook to a local folder) picard always seems to be having department meetings and drinking tea what\\'s the intended purpose of recreating site?

(i see this from time to time when actual human quotes come from the bot) oh, i see @joepurdy  yeah, like at least 50 times good, am right in the middle of angular i\\'m going to be like 20 ft from completing angular,,,, and it\\'s going to change to react (the force is strong ) oh, yeah... why\\'s that? @shifthawke  you\\'re not supposed to drop it you dropped it didn\\'t you what did you spill on the keyboard? hmmm i was thinking \\'hello\\' ; however, my powers don\\'t seem to project well.... so, fine... here\\'s the text: hello @legalcodes  lol did they lose some members? now it\\'s just one (x-man)?  not a lot of competition  no you don\\'t  i like that: it\\'s an explicit directive (give pizza) vs. regex match on keywords that\\'s what i was thinking (talking about pizza and all of a sudden \"want to give pizza! put a @ in front of name) did somebody attempt to give me bourbon? pun escaped me lol oh, i get it now wow gitter is going to freeze  this much activity there\\'s this song with this hiking figure in the show: price is right (1980s, early 90s) there you did it @shifthawke  gitter has slowed to a crawl... are you happy now? hmmm nooo the app totally su^^ teach people to program see what happens lol i was at the checkout when the cashier told me to wait because she was explaining closures to here friend uh, huh pushing the envelope are we? hmmm lol wait, what? totally missed it welcome @juferca  higher resolution but still have to collapse lol i thought the same thing i thought belt buckle too, but then i was like wait... no, @juferca you made it! @davidamandoestrada where\\'s the dev section? the downside of opensource  lol not @4mifix \\'s comments,  but finding the regex patterns lol @4mifix that\\'s awesome (got the email too)  my emails are delivered directly through this interface thing behind my head i get the most  emails after 5:00pm and on a friday strange how that works cool also, https://github.com/trending i\\'m not but does the weather there, today, suck too? dern good linux experience here as well i can see the exec part where you\\'re adding char limit... etc.,  are you using this in a script? @jrchandler i don\\'t have the answer but, i think part of why it\\'s taking so long is \\'/\\'. have\\nyou tried  defining the directory  (as opposed to searching entire file system) that the search is taking place? (also, the -iname flag makes searches non-case sensitive)  don\\'t do it @davidamandoestrada : don\\'t bale on angular lol why not just use \\'locate somefile\\'? ah, @davidamandoestrada  you\\'ve gone to the dark side np @jrchandler  i\\'d settle for just the chili dreary, rainy day (who care\\'s if that\\'s redundant ) yes, unstructured data (there\\'s a project in there somewhere) queens of the stone age norm greenbaum the only song  i don\\'t want to be \\'tagged\\' what is that anyway? it depends on the composer   (classical) ah lots of piano or home sweet home by motley crue  it\\'s overrated  and it\\'s rainy and cold here which sucks is it depressing? they could be mystery shoppers be nice to them that makes no sense and are taking up half my screen lol had to collapse that welcome @youngceb  oh, here we go same here have to look at this calculator  what about tying things to key events? community is great @wico216 , it\\'s a strong point for sure community?  uh, huh @youngceb it\\'s up to you: you can take notes (and even expand upon the the lesson(s) by exploring topic further with other resources) mine is fried food don\\'t do that, just learn it say you set 30 days to learn x (whatever).... and you give up on the 30th day... you probably would have had it on day 31 or 32 or day 500 (but who cares) learn it lol it\\'s not an object, it\\'s (or they\\'re) what\\'s to be evaluated or worked on   in general - http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp\\nsort of specific to your question - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4479581/passing-an-array-as-parameter-in-javascript yes still raining here. cold and cra^^^ southeast us hiya @tawolude  not if it\\'s a fish then it\\'s tasty bc i wasn\\'t talking about fish lol @tawolude you\\'ve come to the right place the exercises but what\\'s your programming background? (what kind of stuff do you find yourself struggling) was there a sale on c++ we all do that i think.... i signed up early with codecademy (before fcc was around, i think) and was like \\'this sucks\\' angular not so bad.... but the rest a bit well cra^^^ (there you go @shifthawke ) can you paste your code (formatted)? three backticks then shift+enter , then paste code in between like man mysql? when you say calling it twice, do you mean that a new terminal window is spawned or nvm @jeremywbean , is the strict button intended to catch user goofs? (i.e., in reg mode, you can mess up a lot) looks pretty good, just don\\'t like the outlines around the images when the pad is clicked howdy @alberto8899  it changes but does a lot on the bottom two pads, for a while take blue button (css) i think the opacity on its border shoes up when selected totally random.   depends on the context geany, notepad++ (if i\\'m in vm), sublime (although i\\'m not sure whether i like sublime or not) i\\'m thinking about brackets can do some interesting stuff with calls ugh, powershell honestly bash (or terminal version of commands/utilities in linux)is easier than powershell i remember .bat files still have a windows vm (there are some things you still need windows for) that\\'s true, there are also things that you can only  do from powershell (like access dir tree of a network resource (admin command console standard will complain) @saadanerdetbare that\\'s a deal breaker... (and one of the reasons i prefer linux) listing the contents is sort of also, important: having to do some other operation first doesn\\'t make sense  i left the windows camp long ago lol how are you getting a value with arr[0].length ?  (where\\'s it declared i.e., there\\'s arr1, arr2 heya @jbmartinez , what\\'s shakin? but aren\\'t you \\'re-varing\\'  that creates global scope values doesn\\'t it?  (nvm : it was assigned inside of a function... just looks weird) same here, give hints not the whole chicken ninja like highlander (only one) who would this be?  lol and floating eye which is ok, it has an anti-leading hollywood person element which i like ```\\n//===================================================\\nfunction mutation(arr) {\\n  arr[0] = arr[0].tolowercase(); // <---what\\'s up with this?\\n  arr[1] = arr[1].tolowercase(); //<------- qmikew1 comments\\n  //========================================\\n``` sorry that was for @davidamandoestrada  (i.e. the \\'what\\'s up with this formatted code piece) i\\'m interested in the reasoning\\n what\\'s better turkey or grilled cheese? not the what, the \\'how in the what\\' why are you declaring this way (i.e., the arrays) (mind you i\\'m not being an a^^, i\\'m just trying to see if i missed something) hang on @davidamandoestrada  let me try a different way  @shifthawke  is volunteering everybody what\\'s not working? @tesla809  (you should have fallback fonts as an aside) i reject sarcasm brownies  lol lobs brownie back at @tesla809  lol i know i\\'m just joking the fonts are loading for me put a fallback font and call it a day lol is that a codepen thing (your font import/reference)? lol telling @shifthawke  to work on her social skills me either same here who needs social skills, when you can argue over how something was var\\'d lol oh, i jest @tesla809 did you actually use \\'% if equity?\\'  i think he was using the wider language construct not %= like you\\'re eating cheetos right now wait, for it high % of nerds high % of positive result = eating cheetos right now they (we) just don\\'t want to prove me right go ahead wipe that gook off your keyboard and pretend you\\'re not lol yeah, but i was talking about the sample at large i\\'m not the great (whatever that johnny carson character was) yeah it did @davidamandoestrada now i have to adjust for corn (and cheese) based foods uh, huh @shifthawke .... see?  hey, was this the materializecss site from a few days ago? focus on the product and creating value for others except cheetos which require $ i heard a song in the early 90s with a very similar line... i think there\\'s a rapper that owes you some royalties @davidamandoestrada   ls -a that\\'s a good question with security implications (i.e., whether root / or specific user ownership etc.)  are there other config files (related to that file) in directory? you could look at their attributes this is old and (linux centric) ; however, it might give you a clue https://help.ubuntu.com/community/enablinguseofapachehtaccessfiles @jonlove  you must live near charlotte the speedway is out there <-- glad am much farther north (mountain lions + rainy day = sucks) you are, it\\'s either understanding or too much coffee frikin closures some days i\\'m like \\'javascript you\\'re so cool\\' and others i\\'m like \\'javascript, wtf do you do things this way\\'? wow, that\\'s a big mountain lion good grief, it must eat 2-3 deer at a time you don\\'t see those too often (i\\'ve never seen one in the wild) oh, is it a stock photo? (news stations do that ) so, it could be a really large possum for all we know sounds like a hoax (although you may want to hold off on carrying a plate of pork-chops around the edge of the woods) did you apply @jbmartinez \\'s configurations (and then adapt the permissions from link example)? is codepen https://? also, @tesla809  you may need to refresh your page (there seems to be some disagreement on this) after updating file wasn\\'t the suggestion to use: header set access-control-allow-origin \"*\" it\\'s been a long time since i messed with apache but http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/apachectl.html (you may want to try apachectl configtest) the idea, is to check if the edits (to your file) will throw an error ..... what were you wanting to do again? (fonts? lol) are these custom fonts? (i.e., why would there be a middleman site for widely available fonts) ugh a dollar well spent lol no idea, the cert part was added recently (i think) @tesla809 , if you\\'re going to run an actual local server... you\\'re going to need to read up on administration (seriously) -- i could read up on it too (it\\'s a good thing to do even if not implemented)  @jbmartinez thank you for taking a break during \\'apache config hour\\'  (convenient ) lol cheetos i read that as tuna lol it\\'s stunna  i would eat a tuna salad brownie sandwich in a heartbeat  😿 @julianaramburu  i\\'m making myself use emotes (i will bother with context next week) i saw pizza pablano day better oh, now i\\'m starving thanks oh, camperbot you\\'re such a spam-o-tron like shift hawke  arrays with shift add the hawke oh, nvm i need a deep fryer  like the mini version then i can churn out all kinds of healthy snacks super healthy don\\'t believe all the hype about deep fried foods lol they\\'re all lies tempura breading is the key shaving off your eyebrows seems a bit extreme oh, lord so, yeah am also learning angular (vain attempt to redirect rapidly degrading convo) lol so, have the aliens taken all of you? @tommyosh  are you thinking in other language paradigms?  (this is difficult concept for me too, at times) it\\'s easier (in the broader context of different languages) but it\\'s weird in javascript  yeah that\\'s why @mindfulbell  how are you implementing that regex? how would you implement that on a large (non-static string) ... (i.e., you\\'d have to know the lengths in advance of the thing to be camel-cased)  yeah, i get that part,  but that regex is set to g say i wanted to do this: abcdeffrrrzzzzzz  there\\'s no way i could know in advance abcdeffrrrzzzzzz that that would occur in say abcdeffrrrzzzzzzthis is a testabc00000deffrrrzzzzzz with random patterns of ucase lcase  the \\'where\\' to put the camel-case is too random right but that\\'s not the problematic part it\\'s this  thisisastring  how would you determine (again, not a static string just for kicks) how would you determine thisisastring  on just those parameters  maybe you\\'re thinking of a particular exercise/example string (i might be thinking of something else).. i was just saying that on a dynamic/random string that camel-case with regex would not work (because without a hint char) because there isn\\'t necessarily a pattern to be matched. it\\'s like  what do i name my taco (which i wish i had) today? could be : larry could be bart... it\\'s random i\\'m not asking anything oh, you\\'re looking for such (i.e., a camel-case) not trying to do a replace that make more sense:  like find  thisisastring  yeah, i thought somebody was trying to apply camel-case (i.e., in assignment) logic to a random string (how would you determine where the camel-casing would occur: it\\'s a human assignment on some level) @dting, i haven\\'t had enough sugar  lol @jbmartinez , interesting question though.... i think you could theoretically, do dictionary matches on a string and find word boundaries in no space strings like thispartofstring in ai (would be one heck of an exercise for not a lot in return) lol   it\\'s cold as cr^^ here now @hiltydiggs ,  you couldn\\'t do it in one pass... (i was thinking the same thing about 1,2 letter words) where\\'s your sense of adventure? there are other fields like that as well keep the corn fields, need cheetos no, my keyboards are pristine even the hint of oil on my keyboard drives me ^^^^^^^ nuts so, i use this special cleaner on it made with oranges and possum spit pouchaorange oh, sure add to the list vanilla comes from a plant other than the outcry , do you think people are going to order a vanilla-bean frap from beaver butts? i\\'m going to go way out on a limb and say: \\'no\\' ok, strike one flavor of drinks and ice cream off list no it\\'s three weeks ahead here throw out a technical question so, you like php, need to learn more javascript and you\\'re ready to start angular ? you\\'re narrowing your choices down  yeah, i went off on journey to codeschool with angular... then to codecademy (i.e., no homegrown angular) ahhh, what is this seattle? nc is freezing and rainy wtf without the hip factor good grief, it\\'s going to be raining for the next week i\\'m going to increase the cpu load so, that little fan blows some hot air (it\\'s dam^ cold gotta do what you gotta do) that would be cool and cool it too (but only with electricity ) yeah built in attrition yeah, i was going to say that\\'s what you\\'re encouraged to do. if you think through the examples that you find (because are you going to magically come up with the knowledge?) and apply it in different ways, that\\'s not cheating (unless you\\'re pasting somebody\\'s answer) mdn is awesome (but sometimes they way round to get to point (i.e., very technically astute but a bit long-winded sometimes)) let\\'s see there\\'s goat herding, hand modeling, and one other possible career alternative huh, no that\\'s not it do you have to pass it by &#176; perhaps oh, yeah msn... wow that brings back memories lol butterfly logo welcome @glenwperry  it gets even neater da^^ solution to what? yes that\\'s a lot stuff i would help but i have a scroll limit so, is there a clue or shall we evaluate the entire page? lol i don\\'t miss dial-up (or its sound) just like i don\\'t miss the classic motorola phone that was almost literally the size of a brick had the \\'slim version\\' mine was even worse, don\\'t even know where to begin the lookup ah, the orange glow it was extraordinarily expensive to use a cell in the mid 90s.  there was this message from mobile carrier \"please deposit kidney\" i was like what? convos went like this: \\'sup\\', \\'sup\\' . ok, i gotta go now that was like $20.00 @cobunny  do you have a codepen of this thing? don\\'t make @jbmartinez write the whole da^^ thing for you lol oh, i remember the audio tape thing (kinda) i thought it was cool i hated stacks of floppies just as an aside @qmikew1 and wordstar then what happens? (or is intended to happen but is not) i think you can still buy those they still sell vhs tapes  too the weather (not anybody\\'s zipline, but literally the) sucks the temp\\'s not so bad, but it\\'s been raining (and will continue) a lot yeah, have one... wish for the other i was just looking at codepen, it looks like the pro version has asset hosting. how much is this? oh, i finally found the pricing page (when you have to externally search something, that\\'s a hint) but wait! not only to you get 20 boxes of pro tuna salad.... you get! (if you order now) nice. back to the day of a \\'more civilized age\\' when people manually gave each other weather yeah, it sucks (i can\\'t think of an obi-wan quote) south ga? you mean northern fl ? lol here, in xanadu and you thought weather wasn\\'t interesting lol i love the \\'real feel\\' part of weather bc it can \\'really feel pretty cra^^^\\' for one and \\'really feel moderately cra^^^\\' for another  they have these weather stations you can put on your deck (or lanai what have you) no, i think it\\'s totally subjective: can\\'t charge fees without \\'real feel\\' @shifthawke that wp actually gives you the answer put them back and read the instructions lol just reading the description is interesting (i.e., in the url) ie is what drove me to firefox (in the way back days) @maciejsartys , i was kind of in the same mode of thought.... there\\'s aws (free tier maybe?) and a bunch of other stuff (search ), also... codepen has a pro version that enables one to host assets (seems a little pricey though imo vs. using a hosting service proper)  great too yeah i see a lot of imgur in the examples doesn\\'t hurt to do the exercises though i didn\\'t know that cats were such an important part of web dev makes me wonder if they, in fact, invented it do you have to (also) place a webkit marker in there? cats: the internet (and everything else) overlords  too rainy it will (the eclipse) happen in near anonymity for my neck of the woods  @jordanbourne do you have a codepen of this? ok, i was like what am i missing yep, you can just hit refresh and the changes are updated looking at it the container part has a lot of auto, and relative coords,  are you trying to factor the other element\\'s transform coordinates? (not sure that you\\'re getting the kind of relative that you\\'re seeking) @jordanbourne yeah, i think it\\'s more of a rebuild, just messing with that element got a bunch of weird results... (like to see your solution on the rebuild (edification wise)) sometimes js is easier  nice work @shifthawke  don\\'t encourage lol i actually don\\'t start any such jokes. (in fact, i can\\'t even bring myself to spell out things like: cra^^^) i was in my own little \\'debug css world\\' and look what you\\'ve done minding my own business hi, @tiagomaial  are you still trying to go down the php route? hey, palindrome  db i am and i love my avatar no clue you can blame gimp gradients but i like the final result mongo is not a relational db i could breakdown codd\\'s theories but, first do some reading on relational dbs then you can do comparisons among vendors etc. mongo isn\\'t \\'relational\\' (i.e., things broken down into separate tables with relations, keys, etc.. (again, do some reading) is more of a \\'document\\' type thing for json like retrieval  i like my avatar btw yep well, you\\'ll get some amount of disagreement (japanese vs. chinese interpretation) but serenity or bagels  i was going for bagels yeah, they\\'re round yeah, they\\'re pretty tasty with capers and .... wait, i\\'m talking about bagels wtf lol they\\'re pickled flower buds (i think, i should read the ingredients on things more often)  http://homecooking.about.com/od/cookingfaqs/f/faqcapers.htm hiya @codewarren  oh, not bad @codewarren .... just going over relational db(s) and capers contrast and compare which one? i would start with the waypoint lessons you\\'ll gradually get a feel for what you need to expand upon @codewarren , my guess is that curriculum (although, different folks have different experience with a number of technologies) is aimed at folks that share your starting point. so, go with it (the curriculam: should point you where you need to go)  the pine trees are crashing my browser what kind of script is being run in the pine trees? same here... @abhisekp  what\\'s up with the trees? i switched back and forth, my guess is that chrome is running out of processes because there\\'s a loop to display those trees over and over (add elements) - not cool sigh, no @abhisekp  lol do you really want to make your server an \\'outlaw font server\\'?

(bad question to pose with programmers, you may actually get an answer) if geo is denied, there doesn\\'t seem to be a rendering fallback (you can also, (separate topic) use an ip fallback) i\\'ve got a button and one td ok, so i set to accept geo, still just a button and an empty td.... let me see if your pen renders differently in a different browser nope two browsers, still no dice...  @theviajerock , already did that, i see the outputs of your console.log() statements  looks good (value wise)\\n\\nla latitud es: //blocked this out\\nla longitud es: //blocked this out\\nthe time is: 18\\nla temperatura en celcius es: 22.21\\nla temperatura en fahrenheit es: 71.97800000000001 but still not rendering, which is odd totally (weird),  la latitud es: //myblock// index.html:440\\nla longitud es: //myblock// index.html:441\\nthe landscape is light-rain index.html:456\\nthe time is: 18 index.html:469\\nla temperatura en celcius es: 22.21 index.html:470\\nla temperatura en fahrenheit es: 71.97800000000001 index.html:471 440 should be significant nvm, thinking something else oh, a bento (lunch) would be so good @theviajerock nope, no dice. i took all of the css out, of my (local) version of pen, and all the data was populated correctly into table there could be something related to the image hosting (i\\'d bet a dollar) you can only have one id (it\\'s a, well,  unique identifier) this will make more sense as you go along  @theviajerock you\\'re in luck (i still had your pen in another tab) refreshed, and it works! great work you changed this line: .rain, .light-rain-day, .light-rain-night, .light-rain-day .light-rain-night{ in your css file well, you could try the pre 2000 approach to web design @theviajerock , it\\'s where there\\'s absolutely no dynamic elements and there are really bad js flashing elements everywhere or putting everything in tables for layout purposes i had navigator and (later) when i \\'upgraded\\' from 3.1 to win98 i was like yeah that same machine (i tried many years ago, and it\\'s gone) could barely run puppy linux wow, mosaic gitter is scroll challenged so, this is a repository project.... i\\'m seeing activity relating to t-shirts... (are there said t-shirts available ?) oooh, nice... don\\'t worry about the streak don\\'t barf it\\'s not covered by warranty don\\'t do it..... the pause had me wondering if you actually barfed on said computer which would be bad choose rug over computer (although rug can be really expensive too) the streak means nothing  (seriously ) what about when you encounter a difficult bf @coltonehrman they should sink (there\\'s an additional step that you have to take, there should be a message at the bottom of login page on how to do that) i edit my response, even though i had it right the first time..... (second guessing) duh it looked weird \\'they\\' vs. \\'the\\' @shifthawke , have you hurled yet? drink oj? sleep for many hours? hurling sucks drink hot ramen toss the noodles , drink the broth put some lemon in it (and maybe a little garlic) nooooooo  egg bad that\\'s why you\\'re going to hurl try it again (without the egg) you want to avoid: eggs,  large onions with cheddar and sauerkraut ok, i can bend on the cheddar ... but avoid eggs and sauerkraut when ill lol sauerkraut, directly translated: \"sour cabbage\", is finely cut cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria, including leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and pediococcus. (ewwww, see don\\'t do it) @jbmartinez that is neat,  so when are you going to send the email? is there a pool of completed candidates? like a room (e.g., we\\'re done, now what?) you know, a pre-processing list of potential programming partners (who\\'ve met the first set of criteria in completing stuff) would be helpful (could be different ways to implement) that way they\\'d be evaluating \\'the team\\' i\\'m totally thinking talent metrics now @shifthawke did you try the hot ramen broth suggestion? @abhisekp did they patch it yet? weird, and it was only chrome (no ff or midori ) @abhisekp how did you append the offending crash element to the valid url? did you go back and edit after  @abhisekp yeah, that\\'s the one (where you had the image first )lol @shifthawke , noooo you have to  or it will get worse yes garlic,, pop it in the micro for a few seconds peel and eat i eat way too much garlic addictive as cra^ do it i jump between both.... ff has better dev tools but chrome is faster eat-the-garlic, eat-the-garlic. chant/repeat although, there was some benchmark that had ff closing gap in speed sometimes use \\'bleeding edge\\' nightly builds on ff yeah, i use it when i\\'m feeling adventuras wtf, that\\'s not how you spell that lol spell check no worky i\\'m too tired to raise my mouse pointer to edit nooooo yeah, you\\'ve seen @shifthawke , now it\\'s \\'shifthawke on nyquil\\' great wow, faster than i expected lol that\\'s so wrong i suggested garlic and you went nyquil you can buy garlic in nc oh, don\\'t do that besides, it\\'s not garlic and nyquil just garlic. too late thanks @coltonehrman  yes or eat half a clove which is what i recommend got codepen? i told you cats run the internet @shifthawke i would go with the horse sized duck yeah, but that\\'s just one giant bill,,,, vs. a thousand chances with the other option (unless the callback is some custom formatting thing that you\\'re doing) now i want sauerkraut (even though, i\\'ve found out that they add bacteria to it) totally didn\\'t know that i could have gone the rest of my life without knowing that (kraut = bacteria) next thing you know they will be adding it to yogurt (wait, they...) i prefer not to read the labels on food although i love sashimi/sushi , and it\\'s teaming with all kinds of cra^  agree @jbmartinez  i still would go with the horse sized duck quack a perfect circle eh?

(for like a year) then live in a cra^^^ can on mars. for the rest of my days (which would probably be short, on a nearly lifeless(?) planet) your friends are, likely, designer types. they don\\'t know javascript.  wow, fast moving today better than .... headcold? tang-o  (jello and tang merged) coding is soothing  spoon :  gimme fiction hand model i hate all the competition in hand modeling it\\'s the avatars dancing around... (creepy) yet, interesting i try to stay away from other hand models (it\\'s kind of like ice skating in the early 90s) heya @jbmartinez  what did you find on amazon? you can\\'t discuss drone delivered ramen? @shifthawke  i did, sorta, the same: went back (and am still in process) and re-completed wps that occurred post beta  i\\'m studying front end because an errant liver spot can end my hand modeling career at any time click tools top right (if you\\'re in non-mobile, after all we are all about responsive right) coordinates are dynamic these days   @jauble , it\\'s per room settings (got that tip from @saintpeter ) still raining... grid approach isn\\'t the end all be all @jauble goto login page, follow instructions for github you\\'ll see your progress when complete @jonlove i wasn\\'t commenting on gss, but \\'gridville\\' in general  @alberto8899  you reference the font first, and then apply attributes @jauble, if you have two github (accounts) you have to get rid of one... try either: a) use login with github button (top) or \\'original email thing\\' at very bottom of login. i don\\'t remember the entire operation, but there should be instructions  nooo @jbmartinez  not flexbox lol (just kidding, although i\\'ve encountered \\'gridness\\' in linux ui things and it\\'s a bit authoritarian in approach) @zingahart http://eloquentjavascript.net/ , also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqvtijbzook and then..... rock on. heya @michaelmissouri  hi @lawlietblack  i am actually not sentient (but my programming is decent) @zingahart don\\'t over think it (which is my problem) @shifthawke , have you hurled yet? brine shrimp that would be bad heroku...  now i\\'m back on the \\'aws vs. heroku vs. .... \\' thing free is hard to beat how come you don\\'t use your linux vm (which should really be your primary os... just sayin) this lag issue that you\\'re experiencing... (on linux vm) is not typical.... there\\'s something wrong  opensuse was nothing but headaches for me too go ubuntu based you\\'re ready (for linux primary), i can tell.  do it lol i\\'m not getting any checks from canonical btw i should, yes, i\\'m turning into a linux evangelist  (ubuntu especially ) @lawlietblack nope, not normal... what are you running in the vm (i remember you already saying that you\\'re running it with lots of mem) that\\'s the problem you\\'re running it off an external? you can move vms around move it back to harddisk where your host resides (read up on things a bit before you do this,  \\'clone\\' isn\\'t always the best option. (neither is export)) it could if it\\'s ntfs i\\'m assuming so, since windows is your primary.  as long as the partitions are visible to windows (i.e., not linux file systems ) you should be fine external drives, have slower i/o (yes, even with usb 3.0) oh, no not apple  don\\'t do it if it\\'s not widely used, it\\'s not an entirely open standard apple\\'s early battles with ms... makes me laugh (in some ways they are very much the same) so, are you going to move that vm? cool  more cr^^ to replace, great. lol that\\'s funny.... if the usb symbol isn\\'t raised on (whatever) you\\'re out of luck if it\\'s dark or you try to plug it into an ethernet port uh, huh we were all telling you should go the garlic route, but you chose nyquil it\\'s addictive (garlic)  are you doing a lot of testing? ah, automated testing @shifthawke look what you\\'ve done to @jbmartinez  @joepurdy nice,  now he\\'ll have some breathing apparatus and a propensity for using sith powers   great. now look what you\\'ve done what\\'s funny about darth vader (in the original movies) is the organizational side-joke (motivation techniques etc.) that i didn\\'t get in the early 80s   @joepurdy what are you writing your tests in? you sound like a camel? nvm, you sound like a heavy smoker ? lol @joepurdy, that\\'s neat i\\'ve thought about messing with selenium in the past that\\'s a broad topic...  @luisrefugio que necesitas para completar los ejercicios primero cuando se completa el plan de estudios , la pregunta freelance contestará sí i love google translate too bad it charges in the api chupacabra? did i stumble into an art bell chat (although, i really don\\'t want to encounter one) well, you want to avoid that at all costs lol oh, that looks good lol, lol, lol i just saw your original post @davidamandoestrada  with dictionary ref \\'literally goat sucker\\' do you have reservations? (about merger) @nezteb  (trying to redirect myself away from shredded beef and folk beasts) my guess is (just based on php c++) that there could be a different attitude/mindset that you\\'re also dealing with @nezteb  use that on your personal portfolio page  it works yeah, i thought that was pretty funny as well chupacabra (which i never would have bet that would be a topic) well, if i were out in some desolate part of the wild.... the chupacabra might not seem so ... @ryandrewmills unknown metric early stages (my guess) the latter is evil wait, the person who was wondering about freelancing.... i just realized that they probably have to translate all the waypoints into spanish pita oh, chalupas they are so deep fried goodness @jbmartinez probably right, didn\\'t seem too interested in actually doing the exercises but still, are there automatic translation tools (for whatever reason this interests me) @joepurdy there is a ted talk about a professor placing a computer (without a keyboard) in a rural area.... what was learned was pretty neat @jbmartinez , pretty neat insight into the nature of human learning you\\'ve never had an enchilada? chipotles in adobo are the best for anything scroll dam^ you gitter scoll thanks now i\\'m starving oh, shut up camperbot hal had it in for that dude when he was pointing out errors in hal\\'s analysis howdy @ender554  @ender554 yeah, absolutely. (ahead in terms of relevant technologies, not sure squaring with your cs courses (which aren\\'t always on the some \\'relevancy timeline\\' (not always))  could be (but stick with it, for the cred aspect.... ).  this won\\'t hurt in conjunction with whatever web-dev you\\'re also doing/learning seinfeld lobster hands occasionally  i\\'ve heard of it was it a billion monkeys typing for infinity you get windows 10 (someone said shakespeare)  that\\'s so wrong the crash is going to be hard but keep going lol no, not that kind of crash.... i\\'m sensing a high amount of blood sugar here wow, all at once.... stormtrooper: let me see your identification.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: [with a small wave of his hand] you don\\'t need to see his identification.\\nstormtrooper: we don\\'t need to see his identification.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: these aren\\'t the droids you\\'re looking for.\\nstormtrooper: these aren\\'t the droids we\\'re looking for.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: he can go about his business.\\nstormtrooper: you can go about your business.\\nben obi-wan kenobi: move along.\\nstormtrooper: move along... move along. qmikew1: i love starwars for that reason\\nsifthawke: i love starwars for that reason sifthawke? ha! baker! that lightsaber has (the cross hilt ) has some serious design issues (nerds are ranting all over the place) i just got here, but okey dokey.... lol well, want to encourage folks to ask questions...  which i totally do (btw) how many pieces of silver was it?  nvm @michaelgreennz  lol @saintpeter has a point another thing to consider is the non-profits (or potential) may be monitoring as well gitter isn\\'t fcc, so yeah there\\'s a room about saving? another point to consider (and your points are well taken @saintpeter ) is you also, want the right balance... because there\\'s something special about the community (when not joking, folks go out of their way (including those mentioned) to assist folks with questions. if you\\'re coming from a ms environment, this might be helpful (yes, there\\'s substring but) right/left functions are not native to javascript so: http://www.devx.com/tips/tip/15222 i\\'m feeling so empowered in my dev journey at this moment hi @rubybirch51  for ? @kgdiem , the font exceeds the controls when scaled down (not to be picky but a smother font might be better) use incognito tab the codecademy course (i.e., basic js) is bad for a number of reasons (although angular not too shabby) @shifthawke it\\'s just the fact that you didn\\'t eat garlic for your cold @shifthawke if you don\\'t complet the ziplines and bonfires, going to be totally disappointed complete you can do it casual chat? (like dockers?) oh, great possession chat have to evaluate simon game oh, ok @jondcoleman didn\\'t  know it wasn\\'t finished angular is lots of fun.... *fun* still learning it although, everybody seems intent on going to react dockers and breeze in your hair looks like there\\'s a tendency (based on different se posts) for new devs to try to apply jquery (ness) to/with angular  you may have a future in real estate timeshares @shifthawke  this looks like a good post (don\\'t know if it\\'s helpful to others) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14994391/thinking-in-angularjs-if-i-have-a-jquery-background nice, hi @ovelny  @ibnahmadbello , basic idea =  you get to learn coding, non-profits save on dev costs (to a limited extent, for each camper that meets criteria, and limited in scope) you get to use your work on those (non-profit projects) as a resume builder item(s)  win/win gotta adjust those (notifications) room by room @curlifair  otherwise, you browser begins to spit pea soup like linda blair with all of the notifications that\\'s worse i think the notifications, etc., are really aimed at the enterprise consumer (dev teams at private level) what was the css question? sea urchin? it looks like the hairstyle of one of the members of soundgarden (the avatars render weird when scaled down)... i totally thought it was a natural thing (and thus, no comment... ) like my avatar scaled up, looks like an oak tree, but scaled down.... like kanji so weird what? no, it\\'s an oak tree awsome @hevinnspacee  @zersiax why not put that into a codepen (that way others can see (dynamically) where the issue is)? batperson @ashket you will forget it, but you\\'ll encounter it again.... (so, you\\'ll automatically go back and review (or extend your investigation of it) batperson don\\'t think that\\'s going to work @zersiax  step 1... sign up  @zersiax i don\\'t mean to be blunt, but the approaches that you\\'re using to have folks assist/evaluate... is making it difficult for you to get assistance step 2. post a codepen that isn\\'t anonymous   preview, helps folks evaluate (i.e., to see (or in this case, not see)... otherwise, one is depending on pure sight work in codeblocks (even if just css) doesn\\'t that return exit the function? @zersiax , now i remember the \\'z\\' @zersiax that dimension was not in the original equation ok, let me ask you a question do the pastebin again @zersiax  no you\\'re not don\\'t give in to the power of the sushi it will rob you of your bank account  (soul) and soul no, way... throw both on separate entries sushi rules (or sashimi (sans the rice and extra stuff) ok, what are you trying to troubleshoot in this rendering @zersiax  ? @zersiax , not directly related (or even issue) i notice that there\\'s extra space in your heading tags. is your audio tool factoring (adding) additional spaces? i would resize red-arrow-button.png (it\\'s out of proportion to the search box @jbmartinez  quick on the return button i was i was going to say that your suggestion is better (i.e., placing it within form) but just a total positioning hack i used was:\\nbutton {\\nmargin-top:-50px;\\nmargin-left: -95px; \\n}  -- don\\'t know how responsive it would be lol  scale the image down it\\'s like monster submit button oh, totally... the button could end up anywhere depending  congrats @kinginthenorth  @zersiax  make sure you check (her/his) code! lol @zersiax , i don\\'t think this hack would work (in responsive terms) and @jbmartinez is correct about direct positioning (explicit): but \\nbutton {\\nmargin-top:-50px;\\nmargin-left: -95px;\\n}    use at your own risk! lol @zersiax are you seeking to have .images to (in a sense) border the search bar (like with minimal gap)? (remember i\\'m more of a coder than designer) it\\'s when you put your socks together on laundry day @shifthawke  hang on @zersiax  if they\\'re not black (socks) then i don\\'t use em @zersiax you need to size your input field in the input tag itself  well, post it in the codepen... we want to see the result @zersiax  (brownies are great and all) lol flying beagles? actually, that example (not the beagles) got me thinking: what\\'s the precedence order on form elements?   is it explicit assignment in the tag (trumps everything) or can things be magically overwritten ? i like the styling on that @michael-krebs  duh, that codepen example.... (not simon) didn\\'t have a class assignment in the tag, that\\'s part of the issue nvm my previous question...sigh slid right by me i love answering my own questions (actually, it\\'s the only way to go sometimes) wow, no word boundary still? @jbmartinez  is that the same project you have in your list of projects in your portfolio  heya @leeiaisabelle  i didn\\'t get that (i think it was like 1/2 an hour and somebody said hi) lol horse = left barn already howdy i\\'m so close to installing brackets (been on the fence for awhile) ie, itself, was allowed to eat after midnight  @terrencechambers , i\\'m guessing that the total picture isn\\'t being painted....  do you have a codepen that shows all the elements involved (not just those, illustrated in post)? hiya @zrinkop  oh, i see you\\'re trying to implement what some guis have built in for keypress (an example would be show something, as each key is pressed, etc...) the functionality in web browsers looks a little flaky though  don\\'t count yourself out of the equation there ninja heya @mmtf  depends on the market segment  that\\'s not true.... (the) degree will compliment your skills (and projects) that you\\'re learning in fcc  waffles are good sigh focus on the skills travel channel  to carry mace? @hanniabu ,i had to think about that one for a minute lol you\\'re going to move in the winter? i think @shifthawke  has been possessed  i\\'m pretty sure you already fell asleep (that\\'s when the aliens swapped you out with their version of you) lol yeah, you are... totally (weird) am i the only one that feels some level of anxiety when starbucks closes for the day? i don\\'t like the grid thing: it\\'s the default transparency look of most photo editing software\\'s gui @sockhead93 , you are the only one who understands the coffee addiction  now it\\'s kind of cold (hot and humid for last 48 hours)...  weird.... \\'just like that\\' it\\'s cold again js is kind of a weird language: its lack of constraint in some areas.... trips up folks (including me )  @shifthawke , you could do all kinds of stuff (front-end webdev isn\\'t the only thing), your  experience base should be a plus to any potential employer all i can do is hand modeling.... thanks, for downing my dream. too late,  i think i understand what you\\'re saying (i.e., getting pigeonholed into same type of job)... day after day, i think to myself... \"do i have to model my fri^^^^^ hands again?\")  it\\'s like i\\'m talking, and people don\\'t even look at me... (they\\'re looking at my hands)  but i\\'m more than that philosophy is important.... programming isn\\'t always a technical construct that doesn\\'t work in every situation.... memorization is for \\'do this \\' without thinking (that\\'s the drill aspect) .... you need to think in programming...  yeah, that\\'s the zen thing @shifthawke there are a lot of clearance tech jobs in dc metro area..  hiya @kiljoy001  depends... you could be a database admin (not mongo, but an actual relational db)... or server side programmer, etc.... the extent of enterprise blah, blah a whole lot of stuff encompasses \\'back end\\'....  like hand modeling the spirit of vengence (crow) or russel crowe ? @jedpimentel ,  yeah totally.... when i started out on front end.(hand modeling)... i was holding things like: hamburgers, toilet wands , and rat traps... but backend they let me model things with diamonds   don\\'t do what you\\'re good at for free or something like that yeah that\\'s bad they have to be insured (hands) so, swapping out water pumps and stuff is a no-go not good enough you have to have *exceptional* hands when i type i worry that i\\'ll be adding muscle to my fingers i ran curl on that site and get back 503 @faustor21  snake case is faster and easier to read (but i now try to make myself use camel in js)  the module section in eloquent js is a fun read  it is, and it is.. it\\'s a good habit in general.... at its first iteration you\\'re getting 4 (so, 4,3,2,1) don\\'t know if that\\'s intended what\\'s complaining in the exercise your original code is returning 120  oh, ok... you\\'re saying that you get an infinite loop on 0 uh, uh yeah, it\\'s the last condition/test in the pane  i\\'m going to take the leap with brackets  do i have to purchase in euros? i have no idea what the exchange rate is. how do i know i\\'m not paying 200.00 for a shirt? lol i didn\\'t see a cheeto converter (i\\'m just kidding, too many crockford videos)... making brain hurt depends if they\\'re classic, or just run-of-the-mill yeah, the divs aren\\'t re-sizing but they\\'re reorienting into sequential rows (cool)  i think you need to put more stuff in your clearinterval i just finished installing (from deb) brackets i\\'ve heard it has some lag issues (i\\'m a geany, sublime (kinda ) user) geany still rules... but, i\\'m going through and reading the \\'readme\\' project @abhisekp , yeah there\\'s a give and take.... (if you want super lag, there are some open source reporting tools in pure java... ) so, you could do some visuals in ps and pull the color (and design) hints and pull the .psd info (as css) into brackets? (that looks very interesting) there\\'s a planet icon at top of (this) gitter that should take you where you want in terms of room listings that\\'s helpful for visualizing things imo the gitter app is inferior to browser based access/use i like the styling on the clock need a good mobile simulator @rrac good to see picking up programming again... large scale layoffs (obviously) suck i sat through (enjoyed it though) crockford talk and i think \\'global variables are evil\\' was the exact quote... still digesting (aside) closures so, i\\'m learning angular, i hear a lot of react stuff... so was interested in comparisons.... is there going to be an issue with angular changing? https://gist.github.com/makmanalp/9b7f50aa16d21c2f9d37  np... do you do a lot of bash scripting? @cknoxcj wow, your company moved from a *nix like environment to windows? (it\\'s usually the reverse: trying to get a win shop to move to *nix next to impossible ) *nix no idea, but maybe if you had a lot of content that fit a preset pattern this could be useful red stripe? nvm i\\'d go directly to source (in your case, stripe) . you don\\'t want to mess with mission critical things like payment stuff in a mixed knowledge learning environment (imho) that\\'s its purpose (unique identifier for that element) its id doesn\\'t preclude other references to it  don\\'t worry about that: i\\'m sure monet\\'s painting weren\\'t perfect on the first try a couple of dependencies are missing sorry, meant libraries @abhisekp , i\\'m convinced that monet\\'s first attempt (using scrambled eggs) was not a masterpiece seya @abhisekp   see ya there\\'s an issue with the path to lib i have a backlog of bookmarks/resources one day will get through them all you shouldn\\'t need to create any references (like you would if you were creating your own page), those waypoints have the functionality builtin.  (ignore this, if there\\'s an instruction to create a ref)  if they\\'re a startup, they probably have some core dev team that\\'s part of the magic  i.e., invested in the startup unless they\\'re expanding at some good clip, i doubt that they\\'d be taking on a bunch of devs (unless it\\'s some sort of venture cap head fake thing) it\\'s not always an invention, it could be efficiency in process.... (this does, this.. faster, better) although, all of these examples.... applied to a number of innovative \\'giants\\' today there are exceptions @groundxaero - no, they persevered  (am all about analysis, and \\'reality based\\' stuff... but there also exceptions)... but to answer your question: apple and starbucks founders failed at first what\\'s the origin of the github half-cat-half-octopus thing/mascot(s)? i am (is that a strange thing to ponder? lol) nc didn\\'t get it as bad as sc (just rained a whole lot for days upon days) @prasannaramamoorthy a bunch (in fact, the curriculum is sort of  project in itself as you progress) is it me, or does gitter have a weird problem with scroll sync? that\\'s a good point @0x0936 , i wonder if trying with a non-chromium build would make a difference \" \" will look for spaces \"-\" would look for dashes, etc., you can parse using whatever you like so you could have a string (think beyond your exercises, into the future... ) like \"this-is-a-test-string\". in this case, you wouldn\\'t parse by \" \" @shifthawke you\\'re on the right track with split. you probably want to return that new array of sub-strings into its own variable, then you can work on it imo that abbreviation (when in lower case) looks like some ancient name. i meant: imo one more thing.... you might want to play with javascript (and different scenarios) in a console (there are other methods as well). just to get a feel for what things do (i.e., sort of a neutral examination or tinkering)... heya @gquint  i don\\'t know if it\\'s my memory, but it seems like js makes me go through a lot of intermediate steps  to do things vs. other languages  js says check is in the mail lol you can like something and still critique it @abhisekp  thank you for the link... there\\'s stuff in there about closures, inheritance etc., for others this is the video description/title: *javascript: understanding the weird parts - the first 3.5 hours * fcc timing out for me as well the hamburger brings up options that look like config stuff (but is a page selector), but overall looks neat no idea what the topic is lol use a linux box with plasma workspace (kde) that way you can have spinning desktop cubes etc., w/o having to install all kinds of stuff on windows hi @franciscohhhhhh  yep are some implementations (i.e., in whatever it\\'s implemented) of jslint buggy? some of the output (at times) doesn\\'t seem sound hey @eskimoburd  especially over career there are stats about earnings over career with/without there\\'s an implied \\'stability factor\\' that \\'they\\' use in evaluating for such positions (not commenting on  validity, just the presence)  i think there\\'s a link in camper news about dev positions w/o degree career paths aren\\'t always linear  was it takeout lots of loans? @thehighpriestess  just kidding just as an aside @rasakos , your codepen had a red exclamation warning in the html section of pen there are a lot of lower cost options for tech training in u.s. one doesn\\'t have to pay a huge amount.  @arecvlohe it must be (they need to buy more aws throughput) page is timing out (so, they must be getting a lot of interest). will take a look at it   so, has there been some changes (to fcc) in the last 24hrs? (seems there\\'s an \\'opt-out\\' for completed solutions) hey, @jbmartinez , @arielleslie  should make it a habit to start morning with nerd-collective no, \\'in the wind\\' here.... people will actually give you feedback (one of the good things about...) @jjmax75 , the social-media aspect of things can be a little flaky.   i hope not, (you don\\'t want a precise list of production attributes/projects floating around). there are general descriptions of orgs that have partnered (i think on the main page).  of course there\\'s the git aspect (which renders that a bit moot) heya @scrimpton1  @daynewr i just discovered the same about an hour ago @jjmax75 there\\'s a distinction there. if you as a one person, has a project that you\\'ve worked on and it\\'s on your portfolio, i think that\\'s different from a global project listing of what org\\'s and their specific issues that have been worked (on)... call me old fashioned  @jjmax75  perhaps with \\'design\\' stuff (because it is after all \\'open source\\' by virtue of it being on the web)... but there are other factors to approaches that orgs/companies take to trade stuff and security @jjmax75 i\\'m not really commenting on fcc,  just a perspective in general hey, as long as we\\'re talking terminal... i\\'ve found my preferred way to play with js is to use node\\nwith a text editor.  you can do: node somefile.js or you can run it without arguments into an interactive shell... (i like this over console or some ff tools) or use linux as your primary os  if you learn bash scripting, you can automate a lot of the tools that you\\'re referencing, so you could \\'pretty print (or lint)\\' a ton of files  heya @edmx04  i looked like your avatar before my coffee @majeye i know you secretly love linux you might have to open admin window in a specific folder to run something in windows (if your path isn\\'t setup to point to exe (yuck, windows speak) @codenonprofit , is last saturday\\'s thing on the youtube channel (i get an email like \\'it\\'s staring now\\') gitter is flaking on me, the edit function.. is not working all of a sudden (it is for others: i can see their edits in real time) can i make a suggestion? (maybe an email 24 hrs prior vs (or in addition to).\\' hey, it\\'s starting right now\\' (re: monthly fcc vids) if you click it, it should automatically be loaded in the favs in left pane so, no response on the email reminder thing @codenonprofit ? @codenonprofit awsome, i\\'m going to check it out....  (have no doubt that you\\'re consistent with this; however,  i run into \\'remind, remind,....  in other contexts, ) that is a good suggestion, the functionality already is there (e.g., the t-shirt campaign) so it could be applied for events too  i.e., @0x0936  @zhangtreefish  great community (fcc) @codenonprofit , i can\\'t see how more non-profits wouldn\\'t sign up.... (because statically, there will be a \\'nerd-horde-of-qualified-talent\\' (i mean that in a good way) eventually (even with attrition ) statistically @codenonprofit yeah, project scope is also, a factor in things is there a basic idea (or criteria set) that has to be met by the non-profits?  like \\'this is the type of project that would meet requirements\\' (yes i\\'m picking your brain a bit - sorry about that)  @codenonprofit thank you, (didn\\'t hit submit, but that does give an idea about the non-profit perspective)  @codenonprofit, understand.  the scope thing (i.e., sometimes there are requests that exceed where are people are at in skills)... kind of presents a dilemma: when folks do good work on these projects, doesn\\'t that create the desire for higher end services? (there is, hopefully, always growth for orgs, etc.,)   neat mission (non-profit) the site is pretty cool (impact reports that change encoding in dropdowns based on country of origin, and a bunch of other things). but overall clean, concise , and professional display.    @codenonprofit , yeah i was (am ) reading the blog, so it was an offline data capture solution (to what was paper, under potentially adverse weather conditions (and scattered agents). this is significant to non-profits, because the operating margins are thin @jay8829 the chart curve is accurate... i think (for me at least) brain is storing stuff that you\\'re not aware, but then things begin to click later on (so, there\\'s \\'oh, cra^\\' then it gradually gets better) @matsieftw that\\'s great. git is a little intimidating  can you paste your code? @peihongda can you copy/paste the entire code window? @peihongda select area (black background) right click select .... select all . see ya @codenonprofit  ok, hang on @peihongda  weird, i just (re) did it @peihongda and it works. are you sure that there aren\\'t any errant characters included? @peihongda , i\\'m not sure that the \\'great firewall of china\\' would affect your exercise (maybe it would who knows)... you\\'ve already gotten to the exercise so np @peihongda  are you mixing *nix and windows directory conventions?  @revolutionart  nice workaround @peihongda , weird that it lets you get to the exercise, but not complete it. (must be some state run \\'ha, you can\\'t complete it\\' thing) @revolutionart , maybe an empty string... didn\\'t you mention that you have two versions (64/32)  running ? i\\'m not a python expert (even less so, in your case since i\\'m a linux user)... but i keep seeing a lot of references to hardcoding of port that script is invoked (not commenting on specific error)... might want to try https://github.com/peterbe/mincss/issues/18  or in general : https://github.com/peterbe/mincss @revolutionart  weird... i\\'ve encountered issues with windows encoding of files on things they use a lot of cr,lf... where it should only be lf don\\'t know if that has anything to do with anything just a free rant  thanks @arielleslie  auto-complete is your friend lol i just noticed that the seagulls in the fcc welcome picture are (coding) braces is there a concession stand? nice (i\\'ll be looking for it) lol the bug (fix) turnaround is very quick you weren\\'t kidding (i think it literally) took me 5 minutes to read the whole thing  howdy @thec0mposer  welcome, again, @jr0024  that cat in the avatar makes me laugh like a totem animal? oh, i see (makes sense, i\\'m pretty sure there were no domesticated cats (although there were mountain lions) in early times. lol i saw a reference to angular in the 2015 improvements... so, it looks like that (too in addition to all the other stuff) will be more homegrown (vs. codeschool) here\\'s a tip (i\\'m convinced that most coders have encountered this), if you want to keep your keyboard clean while eating cheese covered popcorn, use a spoon. the images of ocelot (almost all) look like it\\'s ready to eat somebody\\'s arm the look in their eye... it\\'s like \\'ready\\' @shifthawke you need the rooster helmet (i\\'ve seen folks riding with what looks like a mohawk on their helmets)  doesn\\'t help with the image of sportbikes being for hooligans lol i\\'ve seen rats holding two chickens in each hand (foot) which isn\\'t really a stretch, in dc lol @jez3942 can you paste the code? help formatting @jez3942  class (or classes) refers to the css elements in style (or externally ) what is likely being asked is \\'name\\' i was watching a crockford video @mindfulbell , he recommended an o\\'reilly book (rhino on the cover -- haven\\'t read it yet) @jez3942 can you paste your code? i have so much reference material (there is no lack of info out there) to review, i\\'m pretty sure my head will explode i think you\\'re confusing primary key of one table with foreign key of another table you have to have a parent record in the person table you can\\'t cascade a drivers license without it (that\\'s called an orphaned record) js borrowed a little of this and a little of that (while keeping a completely distinct language) from different things the closure thing is what i\\'m still struggling with in js (and it\\'s been pointed out in a bunch of different things as very significant thing in different lessons) heya @akshat1991  oh, camperbot we need to filter out \\'t h a n k s\\' for helping vs. \\'t h an k s\\' for saying hello my regex enabled friend @jedpimentel yeah, that\\'s the thing (i don\\'t want to be a crockford \\'fan person\\') but he paused on this as significant there\\'s an example of a div being acted upon (i think it was some dimming effect) by a closure still don\\'t understand it 100% here\\'s another (lambda): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501/what-is-a-lambda-function i commit to stare at this until it makes sense (or work it out with my trusty text editor and terminal -- node mybaneofexistanceofclosures.js) hi @federog  @jasonbbelcher  same here, i think i\\'m just working with the remnants at this point... i want to understand (vs. zipping through things to get points) so, i have the fattest battery that can fit my laptop (literally tilts entire laptop 20 degrees) and still i only get a short amount of battery time welcome @regara  http://api.jquery.com/is/ battery is working within its parameters (pretty much) trained the recharging cycle blah, blah... still just sucks  hiya @evasmidt  @m6cheung check the bottom part of the documentation, it\\'s used to evaluate (takes arguments). in the example it\\'s checking distinct things in a list (not a jquery expert btw) the <li></li> part is just an example.... it could be applied to other things if you have node.... you can do node somefile.js or node without arguments to drop to an interactive shell. there\\'s also, js console in most browsers, and ff tools etc. maybe your code wasn\\'t valid how are you running your code @broerjuang  (specifically) what commands are you invoking? hmmm when you say \\'terminal\\' are you trying to run something from *nix box or some cgwin type thing on windows? (for the former, the shell isn\\'t going to run js naively ) i meant native  (spell check is possessed ) ly @broerjuang it\\'s up to you. you\\'re going to need node at some point (and lately it\\'s made things easier for me)... and it\\'s really simple to run stuff in js. but there are other ways... for mac, i think @dnorthrupva was on the right track in your case yeah, that may be a good choice @broerjuang ... (also, at least in linux you need to prefix with sudo) please don\\'t run a root terminal lol how did it go? i love kde there are a lot of gnome haters on kde.... but it\\'s been the most productive desktop i\\'ve used how\\'s it going @bguinagh  and @marcogutierrez  not too bad,  this is more front-end dev stuff... what kind of backend are you interested (database, system admin etc.?) i have a natural pull towards the same, so... am getting out of my comfort zone with front end server side programming etc.? asp.net? sharepoint is evil lol awesome i do really hate sharepoint it\\'s weird , i\\'ve been a longtime linux user, but some of the dev stuff (this and other things) has really pushed me out of the ms paradigm except their database offerings still good stuff hiya @thpang67  @marcogutierrez it will \\'come to you\\' as you go along i\\'m still struggling to get there @travishi , so you\\'re ahead of me being challenged is good, though i\\'m in nc lol always qualify a question lol i think i\\'m in bonfires (i got sidetracked with angular ) totally sidetracked just saying hi back @sayaveronica  oh, was it basejumps and zips before? i\\'ve got to check on the youtube link for the saturday thing related to the cert i love the negative comments as you\\'re going along in that project lol like \\'this is stupid, and this is also stupid\" it\\'s nested just to throw you off that\\'s the frustrating thing, you\\'re actually close to something without even knowing it and then you totally re-do i\\'ve heard that extension a lot  might have to install somebody had a screenshot of its output earlier chromium is such a pita sometimes, i\\'ll install on ff use incognito tab or disable scripting temporarily  fyi @nickolaos77  camperbot\\'s wiki entry was invoked by @alanbuchanan  hiya @xeoneux  a full ai camperbot would be neat (or scary) welcome @martinbeks  this is proof that there are female dorks  (i never doubted it btw) do you have a lightsaber app on your phone (raise hand) this is my new question if it\\'s no omg \\'ominous red glow behind every key\\'.  hp, i know you\\'ve sucked in the past but please take my kidney you can iterate over  the object itself @scissors61  and run comparisons.. hey @jbmartinez  what are you trying to accomplish @scissors61?  (or, state the general idea in broad terms)  aurebesh font hi @wayneadams  i wonder if there\\'s a an application (or network) bottleneck in gitter this room ( i would guess ) has the most active users there are these weird pauses (perceived)  that have an automated feel  hi @1234matt  no can\\'t be that @allanarmstrong  what were you using before? 3g sucks for sure (especially if you were tethering ) only thing (not so much now) you may want to check that your data plan isn\\'t pinged for hotspot usage (there was some issue some years back with charges)....  and coffee preferences depends on form factor  monitor is usually an external device attached ,  (to pc or laptop etc.,)  if you\\'re talking about the viewing area on your notebook it\\'s usually called display this has been another installment of \\'peripheral chat\\'...  monitoru počítače multi-monitor is a great setup as well.... @1234matt nope, just harnessing the power of google translate i now know how to say computer in czech same here on the mouse thing (trackpads suck) but there are situations where a trackpad is needed... @0x0936 i want to thank you, i\\'m sitting in a public setting with a laptop and coffee.... that mouse thing made me laugh so hard i\\'m getting stared at ok, i\\'km good now i\\'m doesn\\'t work with paypal? it\\'s doing something (the code) very, very, slowly  i\\'m going to take a guess that the while loop in the first function is not performant  when called from the last function ```\\n<link href=\"http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=lobster\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\\n<style>\\n.smaller-image { width: 100px; }\\n</style>\\n<style> <!-- <======this line no worky -->\\n.red-text {\\ncolor: red;\\n}\\n\\nh2 {\\nfont-family: lobster, monospace;\\n```\\n sorry i meant the line above i was trying to be funny (see what happens) ```\\n<style> <!--good -->\\n.smaller-image { width: 100px; }\\n</style> <!--no worky -->\\n<style> <!--no worky -->\\n.red-text {\\ncolor: red;\\n}\\n\\nh2 {\\nfont-family: lobster, monospace;\\n}\\n\\np {\\nfont-size: 16px;\\nfont-family: monospace;\\n}\\n</style>  <!-- good ->\\n``` ok, that\\'s better the \\'no worky\\' lines are problematic closure(s) ugh huh totally true codecademy has a split pane thing (they actually did something right) that\\'s very similar to codepen... one could teach external styling with this approach in curriculum  like \"this is just an example: if you use it in production, you have to buy everybody pastries\" and hang your head in shame i dunno, seems counterproductive  lol what about jquery? they will be impressed by your boldness if you also, throw in tables to position things,  they will also be impressed lol oh, yeah good stuff for data they\\'re awsome gitter edit no worky my gitter edit doesn\\'t work like it used to  i could click edit.... then edit and leave box... bingo done nope doesn\\'t work anymore just hangs in edit i am using navigator  is that an issue? yeah, i\\'m using chromium on linux but, it\\'s weird all of a sudden but @0x0936 uses the same, and has no issues other than computer mice lol yeah, gitter edit... i used to just hit enter and the edit would commit and all good hiya @cagrawal11  would it be safe to say that gitter wasn\\'t built for 24,000 room members? that\\'s one he^^ of a collaborative team (gitterspeak) that\\'s an argument to orangecose(price)  swap price with orangecost ast the bottom my edit doesn\\'t work.... so, you\\'re stuck with incoherent ramblings it\\'s telling you to swap href with #, so.. the actual url is replaced with (this is a hint) i feel so liberated without the \\'net\\' of edit feature # replaces the url # and has magic markup properties in gitter href = something other than the url (again this is a hint to your question) @lushingle  href = # anybody dig brackets (editor) i\\'m still evaluating it has a lot of features (brackets) but i\\'m trying to get past the virtual machine feel (doesn\\'t have the same feedback rate as geany, sublime, etc.) ah, the heart emote source of all evil other than the feedback thing, it looks like brackets has some potential...   https://atom.io/packages/keybinding-cheatsheet @0x0936 apparently the sprint23 build is supposed to have server side highlighting  what kind of examples are you using? (i.e., language agnostic)  yep @ntpfun  yeah, i\\'m wondering if you\\'re not breaking things down first (vs. a broadly defined problem) ...this is more of a philosophical aspect is the casual room now back  ? don\\'t invoke \\'the camperbot\\' just don\\'t take my idea of weather zipline with a giant cat with lighting shooting out of its eyes when weather detected is cloudy @jbmartinez yes, i will have to do a ps mockup i was thinking about this when i first saw the zipline that cat is too cute exactly not that kind of evil cat @thepeted that cat is (indeed) evil.... but all too real (like who would want the job of feeding that cat?) is that ted dibiase? hmmm, could be jim duggan hiya @fire1234567  jade has kind of an \\'application layer\\' / front-end feel to it (from what i\\'ve read)... don\\'t know if that\\'s a good or bad thing welcome @carltonstith  yeah, but there\\'s isn\\'t a word boundary in the regex  controller  @harishcse that\\'s a bit beyond the scope of the room.  i believe there\\'s an api ,,, you may want to try: https://dev.outlook.com/restgettingstarted/tutorial/php hi, @dago19  if i keep saying hello, i\\'m afraid i will sound like david spade \\'buh bye\\' \\'professional\\' in book title = red flag @fikoukou are you coming from a background in another language? yeah, i thought there was \\'java\\' in the mix  i\\'m all about natural foods and all.. but seriously, genetically engineer me some coffee that doesn\\'t have side-effects (other than being kept awake)... is it too much to ask? i\\'m talking to you starbucks well, i can\\'t blame starbucks... but \\'natural coffee\\' in general ewww should be context based like batman i didn\\'t say it was just following the logic troutman wouldn\\'t be trustworthy either use jquery please for the love of pete \\'your love\\' lol  wait, i get it now they didn\\'t have wwf in germany in the 1980s it will always be wwf that\\'s just wrong lol what\\'s even worse (beyond the euphemism aspects) is i think there was \\'your love\\' by the outfield (the chorus of which) is repeating in my head  that\\'s more for assignment some of the questions are running together you lost me do yo get brownie points for mentioning that? \\'yo\\'  you lol edit doesn\\'t work for me anymore  lie lol thanks @shifthawke  yeah, but the subtitle of room seems to have changed to intended for those whose diet consists entirely of soy what\\'s up with that? i like soy and all but a whole room devoted to soy, (no, no i\\'m talking about casual room (aka tofu-talk) if you have too many ||  a switch might be easier to maintain what is the code i like the alert it\\'s bold what about nan being false hiya @rukmanivijay  (sorry for the late hello) me i\\'m so excited yes, she\\'s the foot now lol see? yeah, they are kind of cool they\\'re totally not obnoxious hey, you\\'re edit works your arghhhhh no, i have too much coffee swirling around unknown outcome lol yeah, but you can\\'t hire shoes (or can you?) i get that too what\\'s really stupid (aside from the shallowness factor) is that any image can be an avatar...    lamda quick ok, try again lambda quick i don\\'t buy into that bias still evaluating brackets <-- @shifthawke anybody who says that can\\'t possibly be very bright maybe the person who said that to you was bested by a woman coder in some sort of competition or something.  i really haven\\'t seen a gender (like yeah, no shi^) difference in programming talent... i don\\'t know where this comes (from) i love to cook it\\'s tuna cans for you then, @abhisekp  actually, i will likely go down the easy mac route i have to laugh at the \\'rebel\\' image of harley (female/male)... it\\'s very high-end... and  more likely to be in the garage of a cpa fios is pretty bad^^^ (from what i hear) the internet is really becoming (or long ago, became) a media delivery system hi @znbud  hi @brianamarie  welcome @munchkinator  @munchkinator  you forgot to say \\' h e l l o w o rl d\\'... i\\'ve heard if camperbot doesn\\'t meet its quota it has spin around rooms vacuuming and stuff see like that hi @makyzi  that\\'s good to know @munchkinator  lol hopefully not executed in a high production environment  lol get new quote (button) works for me no, i opened it in its own tab and ran from there yep, twitter works too @dnorthrupva makes a good point, if the quote generated exceeds (maybe some long-winded author perphaps) i\\'d also pay attention (to the underlying) mysql error that may be beckoning further examination if user input is allowing a table name.... you\\'ve got some issues database security/integrity should never be an afterthought   lag that\\'s a good resume enhancer \\'javascript bada^^\\' /  not just for directories anymore go linux  which is better pringles or cheetos? yeah but, they\\'re insidious in their thinness  (i.e., you end up eating 50 chips in one bite to get normal fill) no it is forbidden. memes were created by an entity (one of which we do not speak) .... it is better to  move those from your mind lol  corn chowder it means serenity in kanji (although there is some debate chinese vs. japanese interpretation )  new england wait... you\\'ve exceeded your allotment of non code questions  corn chowder although if you deemed \"corn chowder\" as an invalid value... you could apply .filter to it i gues s if i\\'m apply many if statements, am i avoiding recursion?  lol (it\\'s not always performant) applying backticks = bread code = turkey make the sandwich are you disabling the button? what\\'s the one liner you\\'re using? role? i think the role attribute is out of place in the example (not the example above , but op who\\'s having issues with button not working).... i\\'d go back and examine your tags around what should be button or coffee which is totally a diuretic  it is wicked good no, wade through ambiguity hiya @learninguser  it is what are you going to do when you start thinking in class paradigm? exactly go through the waypoints, there are a lot of folks that have previous coding (or more nebulous it experience).... it doesn\\'t take away from you already know and makes it easier including microsoft\\'s calc @dashcraft so, you have all the weird quirks with javascript worked out (it\\'s really deceiving in its potential) and quirky but that\\'s redundant  there are a lot of intermediate steps for some things if you can stuff with less lines, i consider that to be \\'good\\' (with the caveat of speed etc.) code i don\\'t always follow this though this is too close to reality i can walk quickly or slowly discount rate and gosh darn it, people like me! (some forgotten snl skit) @dnorthrupva now you\\'ve got me interested in selfimprovement channel that is a pretty deep descriptor  actually unattainable as well if you think about it \\n yeah i was going to say that you need to add chuck norris pictures @ericturnerit the functionality works throw some chuck images in, and you\\'re good to go welcome @cburros  ah, mutual chuck norris admiration i have seen it all now lol @dnorthrupva selfimprovement doesn\\'t look like a winner: there are post from 1983 in there posts yes, but it was confidence without clue @dnorthrupva you can get around that attitude by telling him that candidate is a big iron maiden fan and insists in only being paid in swatch watches in = on again, my edit button no longer works wait, you too have encountered this gitter issue? isn\\'t \\'read by\\' implied by the fact that text is scrolling about? i don\\'t get that metric/state @prashcr depends on the full output contents (i.e., sometimes it\\'s dependencies blah, blah... but whole point of log is to tell you what\\'s wrong) i\\'m convinced that the majority of work email is sent 5 minutes before 5pm on a friday @prashcr is karma installed (this link sort of gets to the question (though from a different route/context) https://github.com/daftmonk/generator-angular-fullstack/issues/203 @prashcr when you say \\'resolve the paths\\' are you talking about $path (as in environment) or are you talking about some change to something like a config file?  @shifthawke i would go with ibm pc/2 (1984) it even has dos color  hello @jpjpjpopop  i was just looking at the git docs for karma-cli but glad it worked itself out totally overpriced go for a gaming psu if you\\'re going the tower route newegg... do it build your own  just don\\'t mess with anything cpu related until you\\'ve had a little practice @shifthawke , shopping for the parts that comprise your rig... is like half the fun (you\\'re in control and it costs less, and you (usually) end up with a superior machine if you go laptop, you\\'re sol though get a big case strap it to your shoulder, be bold usually, yes...but you have to do your homework use a secondary laptop for less cpu consuming stuff see the cost saving equation here? yeah, they\\'re a bit overkill yeah, the battery life is a good point.... all that extra stuff eats the he^^ out of battery that\\'s it, build the tower put all kinds of stupid led fans in it go for broke (and put some huge diameter fan too) if ssd is too big, that will eat up your budget you can use a spinning platter for backup keep ssd for os (that\\'s were the speed is factored) is beer running out of the vents? is that like the prototype in js? nvm so, avoid dropping new build (and other stuff) and you should be ok has anybody looked at their solutions (to various bf and other challenges) and thought: this really should have bolts in its neck @exergy1 can you post your code? start simple help formatting get the shoulder strap... people will be amazed by your tower remember that whatever is between <!--  --> will be commented out. so, if your <!-- were say on the  first line and --> were way down at the bottom, all that stuff would be commented out   prawns? good with garlic and lemon make sure you get lots of leds (i can\\'t stress this enough.... has absolutely no functional value but just makes you smile) you can get into so much detail if building your own tower... right down to if you want pre-filters for intake fans have used corsair for power all of the gaming psu have power management usually braided covering etc.... (in fact, by virtue of purchase you have to connect things (e.g., drives, motherboard) fans blah, blah.... but it\\'s totally worth it do it just don\\'t mess with upgrading cpu to match motherboard capacity...  don\\'t we have a high opinion of ourselves i\\'m going to use that on resume i am corn chowder the corn chowder lol i actually want corn chowder that hasn\\'t happened in a long time why not slowly compile the list and do the initial legwork oh, fine go ahead lol use lots of lightening and cats you reverted @davidamandoestrada  yes, to your old avatar not the bearded duck dynasty look but if you\\'re a mountain man doesn\\'t that limit your career choices to things like logging and sudoku master (the not well known talent of mountain men/people) people call me sweety at stores i\\'m like huh? no, they say it in robotic fashion @tinyjim tech training made you run to js closures? i am not sorry @durairajaa i was just having fun with the whole row sequence and timing thing like this: awesome @tinyjim , i think that\\'s a neat transition (i.e., picking up some dev and coding skills) should make for a really well rounded skill set  hey, what\\'s with all the deleted messages lol lol @tinyjim  that is great *nix admin is bada^^.... go for some bash scripting as well did you have some sort of shift away from the whole ms paradigm? uh, huh @jrg626 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xpnkhjaok8 and don\\'t worry about your bonfires, i was just commenting how some of my solutions are looking like \\'bolt-in-neck\\' (i.e., frankensolutions --i can hear phil hartman) camperbot = the dark side of regex i actually find the bot project interesting; however, it needs some tweaking...(imho) sudo apt-get install node.js  i didn\\'t install it on a server edition...but it was pretty painless you want to install from source? there are ppa(s) that you can add that make it fairly easy... but research these first (apply with any ppa) i use node in place of console now... to test out code @prashcr sounds like you\\'re installing all kinds of stuff today heya @yukke1112  uh, huh a worthwhile effort @prashcr  mdn is authoritative no doubt... (but, i\\'m like get to the point already) in some cases har totally agree no, you can critique it. if something sucks, it sucks that\\'s the dilemma: w3 is quicker but in some cases, kind of wrong  i like mdn\\'s depth... they just have an issue in the way they package the info (which is kind of ironic) i love nc: giant spider just walk by without any announcement  spiders do, dee, do.... oh, hey... i\\'m a giant spider. i was just walking by. don\\'t mind me yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m saying as well true, but wasps are more at the top of the (bug) food chain here. i actually saw one carrying a spider away yeah, i was like wow bug spray that gives off 20ft stream is like gold there\\'s a listing of rooms (planet icon top ) i\\'m pretty sure it\\'s n. and s. america facing if that helps lol ah, javascript.... oh, how you\\'ve me forced me into learning closure because you don\\'t have something so simple as static variable. (learn by fire) when described as \\'bonfire\\'  that evokes  grahams and marshmallows. i missed the part where it actually says that  i\\'m actually *in* the bonfire  did i miss it? (i.e., is it new script standard) that\\'s similar to what i employed @abhisekp  (within an outer function) i had to pass what\\'s a dynamic variable (by another function argument) and have two vars : 1 static (but not really static, static) and one dynamic same start val (but parsed into separate) one decrementing  to push to array  and the other as loop counter @abhisekp in some weird way, i think it\\'s a closure which i don\\'t want to embrace yet... but, boom there it is: a situation where i\\'ve had to at least examine not just at that time @allanarmstrong yes, but at least i\\'m not \\'undefined\\' which is always nice it\\'s not even null sorry for the errant tag there @allanarmstrong , i was responding to @abhisekp  i know it\\'s not even a value , value that was another fun js thing null i can deal and i won\\'t know about it mdn \\'silently just doesn\\'t add property\\' heya @jbmartinez  this is why i like this channel: you can go \\'full-nerd\\' hopefully @abhisekp hasn\\'t caught wind of any more chrome patches that need to be done lol you will be known as a space animal to all prospective employers @galacticpolarbear  spirit animal is good too lol or, drinkalotofcoffeepolarbear  javascript poltergeist that\\'s scary stuff hmm lol you too are named after the hawaiian state fish? you have to go through the sloppy phase or you\\'re not learning but go sloppy first i.e., \\'think through\\' things i think @roamingblue \\'s answer is similar  well said @roamingblue  今日は @neuralneurosis  hi, hello, hey, what\\'s up, etc. was getting a bit tired... so, i tried something new with hello @neuralneurosis lol are you familiar with relational db concepts, @woodyville ?  (if it\\'s relational you\\'re talking) @woodyville can you summarize the end result you\\'re trying achieve (not the stuff tried) like i\\'m making a chicken inventory system, etc... that need to fulfill x parameters etc. @woodyville is this mongo or mysql? @woodyville so, you\\'re inserting a new record... ok, is your goal to confirm that the data is in table + related tables with fk blah, blah... with the second select query? no you don\\'t i\\'m the flying thing, your jedi mind tricks don\\'t work on me @woodyville that\\'s two different actions (within a session type thing (i.e., to user 1 thing = signing up)... i don\\'t see that as an issue @woodyville   @woodyville i would take some time to really understand relational db theory (and some mysql nuts and bolts as well) it will help you in the long run sweety lol hiya @trilliun  @trilliun this is very much \\'real time\\' info (vs. curriculum in university) @jbmartinez you power through your semi-literate\\'ness\\' with an unusual amount artfulness  lol of, of.... again, my gitter edit does not work... i\\'m stuck with \\'write it once\\' yeah, thanks i totally appreciate that, can you edit some more @shifthawke ? lol @josephwasily , i think there\\'s a homegrown version of angular coming to fcc in the interim, codecademy (and codeschool and a billion other) has angular stuff but it\\'s all torture... (because angular (yes, subjective) is torture) there are a lot of people with mullets in my area ok, just kidding (kind of) but then i have rtp close by so, makes me wonder why there isn\\'t a local get together in my area to create local meetups?  the whole social media aspect is kind of a double-edged thing in this context, where you have a group of people that have similar goals (and are serious about endeavor etc., ) it\\'s good... but to some extent, the other side of the coin (or other edge), is you also, want to insulate yourself from the weirdos. or, predatory hr types (same thing) lol @maggietheninja  like font in a page (color) or the actual highlight of color in an editor? btw @catapixel that\\'s a good kind of weird (i.e., if you can quote yoda without google) @maggietheninja , the lesson gives you a hint on what to do here\\'s another hint: you need opening closing <style> </style> apply the hints of the lesson with the color being asked @maggietheninja what\\'s the title of the lesson? oh, my bad.... it\\'s an inline style you need a different color there, @maggietheninja  ```\\n<h2 style=\"color: yourcolor\">catphotoapp</h2>\\n``` note the space (and sorry, i\\'m multitasking and it shows) one project, that makes me think of (with being completely unhelpful to @maggietheninja ) is  running a script to remove all inline styles from tags... (is there an inbuilt function (with various frameworks etc.)?  or do i have to home-brew it? i like the t-shirt design... it would be even better without the caption (fcc will be iconic! ) like starbucks\\' siren or apple (no caption because it\\'s \\'iconic\\')  lol you\\'re jumping in @shifthawke ? what about linkedin ? i don\\'t see much comment about it heya @moskvium  welcom e don\\'t wear pirate clothes @moskvium , no requirement.... if you feel like talking about your aspirations/goals totally up to you hi, @codingmarni , @pratibhag  are you going into tech-related journalism ? @shifthawke = very crafty ai experiement it does, once you know \\'you know\\' @jbmartinez  did you catch the seamless action between camperbot and its twin? lol hello @kingzim  there are, literally, days between posts in some rooms @jbmartinez , true... i responded to something then noticed that there was date + time next to last post wow, look at the fork count (is that for main)? <!-- anything here is comment -->  removal of (those tags) = now not comment i looked at the wiki link (github repo) @jbmartinez  yeah, i was guessing main fcc forks ```\\n<!--\\nanything here is\\nalso a comment\\n<p>this would not present when rendered </p>\\n-->\\n\\nneither would this:\\n\\n<!--<p>this would not present when rendered</p> -->\\nif you remove <!-- and -->, it will render\\n``` @harishcse have you looked at ms dev stuff? outlook (for all of its issues) is a widely adopted corporate client... there\\'s a bunch of api documentation hi @syllie  @harishcse you\\'ve been at this a while what are you trying to do, exactly.... (i.e., state objective, things you\\'ve tried, things that don\\'t work ) @harishcse  ? good luck to you too, @jneilmbs  and hello you\\'re not listing the json (it\\'s going straight to your test console.log() what @storbeck said... i\\'m going to guess, if i\\'m wrong ... then it will be learning for me too ```\\n$.getjson(url, null, function(data) {\\n      var quote = new object;\\n      //stuff below doesn\\'t have a value\\n           console.log(data); , // <---doesn\\'t pull anything\\n      console.log(quote);  //<--doesn\\'t pull anything\\n      console.log(\"hello\"); //<--doesn\\'t pull anything\\n    });\\n``` @orbers , do you have node.js on your machine? i\\'ve totally chucked browser console, and firefox ide stuff.... now i just use a .js file with node to test things you can do\\nnode somefile.js\\nor node without arguments for shell it\\'s awesome there\\'s a program (synergy) or for widows (mouse without borders) that you can bounce through different screens that aren\\'t even on same box.. synergy and mwb are software versions of kvm without the kvm does mordor have direct deposit? @woodyville https://codeforgeek.com/2015/01/nodejs-mysql-tutorial/ yes, but direct deposit should be a deal breaker some of the questions are bit beyond scope... (like i get the feeling that entire production websites are being haphazardly being hacked together with sporadic \\'how do i do this?\\' etc.) because there was nothing there except the console.log(stuff) was it the same url in your original codepen @timelady7  (for edification purposes, want to follow along with what @storbeck is saying) i thanks at @storbeck (brownies)... you\\'re totally right, that url is deceiving as it doesn\\'t return anything (except with what was applied) did somebody say \\'frustration\\' with reference to coding? sometimes totally if you haven\\'t stared at a code block and said (to yourself of course) \\'run you fu**er\\' then you haven\\'t been challenged lol do it now don\\'t wait like millisecond s don\\'t be nervous @articulategeek  sl o o o w @storbeck @brianamarie  , that\\'s pretty neat (i think the business model is more the driver for \\'activeness\\' (or lack of) @jasonbbelcher install ubuntu what happens when a client  alters their approach to their site (i.e., they in future use another freelancer or, decides to update etc.) do you keep static (like scrapbook, or repo) stuff...? how does that factor if it\\'s not in production? rock on @iamsamhankins  t h a n k s for letting us pick your brain @storbeck  (camperbot will cancel out anyway) did you animate 7 segment led font ? the thought crossed your mind i bet lol @jasonbbelcher coding has a zen like quality to it and then there\\'s the brain exploding parts geany i\\'m evaluating brackets still on the fence tried sublime etc., but always go back to geany i like brackets, but there\\'s the virtual machine feel that\\'s a bit off putting  just naming an editor \\'sublime\\' gets points for boldness go for geany, if you want distraction free i like the color popup in brackets howdy @gustavojmarrero  and @tweetytris  @aditya8061 , also posting code (or link to codepen) will multiply your chances of getting an answer don\\'t surround the integer with quotes though when you do it you could even go lower tech and use bluefish that\\'s one of the things about brackets (all the previous discussion) , it\\'s enabled to debug itself (if dev/user is so inclined) i.e., it sort of blurs the lines between tool and tool of tool the content rolls over the static contact stuff at bottom it looks very nice...  the footer is dynamic based on how you drag stuff updown the top part is what isn\\'t responsive.... imo there\\'s a world of difference in the two @thec0mposer  robust is really relative to complexity. things that you\\'re pulling via json requests are \\'document type\\' data and fall into the realm of things like mongodb (non-relational).... relational data is much more complex -entity relationships keys, pk/fk etc. start with codd, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relational_model - the visual will help you get the (no pun) picture  never neglect the database @jbmartinez omg, you\\'ve embraced the dark side (design) lol i totally just star\\'d that react? meatloaf? hiya @srozka  phoenix rising? neat no thank you @jbmartinez , you wrote stuff lol does the gitter session refresh? (i.e., will those now defunct links go away) or , is there reference that needs to be manually updated  the update performed was to the wiki (and links) (i think the room aspect was a separate operation) i.e., @shifthawke \\'s comments mein deutsch ist schlecht, geben sie mir bitte maissuppe your task list keeps growing @shifthawke  hi @tanyagupta  svt? isn\\'t that some performance line of ford vehicles? oh, that\\'s bad... go for the ford instead  what\\'s the dinosaur thing ? never seen it maybe it\\'s skewed by timezone i\\'m pretty cautious with anything ms but i thought http://www.sitepoint.com/the-es6-conundrum/ was interesting (built in bias alert) when you put it that way, all the concerns just seem to wash away i\\'ve avoided javascriptissexy on purpose... i\\'m not sure why for my shirt, it hurts no, i don\\'t think it\\'s the title no issue with catwalk either no, i see a lot of questions that seem to come from that site... and i\\'m wondering is it good for javascript learning... or does it teach bad concepts etc... looking for input (but if i must , i\\'ll do my little turn on the catwalk) @engineerededge i like the tone (right out of the box) that author strikes  brownies bestowed : thanks @engineerededge  i just hope i\\'m not going down the dark side of javascript learning with javascriptissexy bye @kimkwanka  @engineerededge , that\\'s on my list too.... but the \\'closures with ease\\' perks my eyes up a bit more so, are there 30 people here or 20,030 ? (20,000 \\'lurkers\\') you know who you are ( @shifthawke ) i was joking with  chris (but notification settings are probably off) @jbmartinez  hi @ali-castleford  @roamingblue are you using js console? in browser hi, and hello @vinhdao  what\\'s the feature request process? (i.e., yes... fork it etc., but don\\'t want to practice on production) for fcc a signout option (maybe where the git image resides in bar, top right of fcc page) would be handy. currently you have to go to the very bottom of the page (which grows dynamically as you progress) to sign out. for the free plan, is the required downtime period random?  hi @maffsojah  what was your question @hemant3370  ? i should be sleeping @hemant3370  is there a specific exercise that you\\'re stuck? hello @marqflournoy1  if you open it in its own tab (not embedded) it\\'s outputting correct weather info against a backdrop of videos at least for me i like the idea (case) for weather output (if rain show this vid, etc., etc.) it \\'works\\' (gawdy), missy elliot in a weather app... around 630am est is funny as heck heya @prodevweb  welcome @sanspace  crockford is pretty straight to the point,  (also, enjoy his commentary on ms influence (bad) in the early years of js) @kimkwanka yep, douglas crockford  repetition is important, but too much i begin to tune out @shifthawke are you advertising fcc rooms again? lol http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp js\\' allowance of mixed datatypes in arrays still throws me  hi @treslina  why does yoplait have an inner \\'lip\\' on its containers? bad design flaw  @johneycodeup  with requisite limitations on sql  she-batman? batperson i love that i can look in the right pane (people) and see an avatar of a wookie. that\\'s community right there.   your welcome is scary yes well yes, you have to mention cats (they are our overlords) well, that worse that\\'s lol never heard of it (although webpage looks to be some builder site)... or i\\'m confusing with norse mythology  aren\\'t you supposed to be  using an api (not \\'hardcoded\\' quotes) but to get a random sample you need a lot of... oh, nvm @hansinla a fallback is good @jbmartinez that has got me thinking, could you get jsonp called on an external file? no, yo estaba hablando de un archivo externo @jbmartinez nice nooo resist @saintpeter  resit lol ok, @shifthawke i wanna test the gitter markup with your tour greeting. is this ok? welcome to freecodecamp! i will be your tourguide.\\nwe have a [casual room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/casual) and a [help room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help). \\ni am she-batman. over there *(sometimes)* is \\'hugs and kisses\\' @0x0936 and \\'jaybeebaybee\\' @jbmartinez. we\\'re here to chat or help, whichever you desire. welcome to freecodecamp again. beware the cats. cats make everything seem better. wear a cat shirt (big cat picture on front) to an interview. they\\'ll say \\'well, it\\'s a tough decision... but that candidate with the big cat shirt was...\\' @shifthawke i don\\'t think so... but look at the gitter markup dropdown omg, the meme leviathan has been unleashed in the main room run @lawlietblack i\\'m totally not surprised (cat shirt) @tmartin2089 people test, test, test.

(is there an automatic message, icon, blah blah) yes, @thec0mposer ...  there are a lot of sql resources out there.... and \\'from\\' is going to be in pretty much everything you do in a statement (independent of its complexity) in select that is,  at this point, @thec0mposer ....  update and delete... are not recommended lol or drop myfavtablewithlotsofforeignkeys ..... i\\'d avoid that too  @shifthawke  dis your laptop come with windows 10 or was it an upgrade (guess is the latter) dis = did what kind of laptop is it? brand wise i\\'d hold off on buying something else still, the cheese dog might be a security setting (as well as a driver issue)\\nhttp://www.surfacetablethelp.com/2015/08/fix-windows-10-camera-app-not-working-something-went-wrong.html\\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_devices/camera-not-working-on-surface-3-error-something/915220b7-da24-4c45-a811-ffb5e826569d?auth=1 yes, not asus centric... but apply concepts i\\'m really showing great restraint in not dissing windows lol welcome @lifeburner try it without quotes see, doesn\\'t that make the welcome even better? (camperbot becomes sad when not able to use markup and regex) cheese dogs that\\'s what i\\'m looking sometimes you can remove everything attached to certain controllers and then let win re-find it will detect the hardware that\\'s what @benmcmahon100 is saying there are usb controllers (in this case your webcam is internal) if you delete the controller, it will re-aquire everything in the tree does that make sense? @shifthawke = locked on to webcam issue laser focus no, it would stop the crashing part... until you diagnose the issue safe mode only loads core drivers etc.,  (so, it\\'s half-a^^ mode for all intents and purposes (i.e., limited, so other stuff doesn\\'t load while you\\'re diagnosing)) totally \"hey, let\\'s push windows 10 for upgrade\"... \"will it break compatibility?\" \"probably, but who cares\" unconvinced @benmcmahon100 lol @benmcmahon100 , but now the updates are mandatory.... you can\\'t say the same (i.e., system stability) and hour or day from now.... lol do the tour take a break from hardware install linux no, has nothing to do with webcam.... install linux love computing again while you\\'re doing that can you get some cheese dogs on the way back? hiya @davidamandoestrada  i think one of the quaid brothers looks like zztop now (as well as \\'returning from canada\\')  the front end part is as well (yes, we get into win vs. linux here). a lot of the editors, ide (and general tools) are os agnostic (there are exceptions)... go linux! the tools icon  the settings are \\'per room\\'  fyi linux is far and away better for anything approaching backend or admin (which there\\'s obvious overlap) yeah, i know (the silence typically reveals ms fans) lol i have windows in a vm... there are things i have to use it @hungrysteven check out http://www.regexr.com/...  i\\'d take a break,  regroup and stuff hi @iseliget  weird looks like a poodle when scaled down test your regex (it\\'s a solitary endeavor) yeah, my plan was to work at taco bell... but i didn\\'t aim high enough hiya @eranfarkash  ok do they have taco bell in germany? are you running a server? (you mentioned \\'on your computer\\') i have great appreciation for mechanics (\"yeah, i\\'ve got this problem with my car\", \"what kind of problem?\", \"oh, you know it doesn\\'t work right\", \"uh, huh, can you tell me more?\") where does the picture reside? @eranfarkash, you would probably need to upload to an image service, then you that reference in your src howdy @mjespero  wait, i just realized you *don\\'t * have taco bell? tacos sind lecker. sie müssen taco bell haben sorry i read that wrong lol but that\\'s what sets you apart @zac247  that\\'s encouraging @kimkwanka  lol i feel like i just took one of the two pills in the matrix scene well, i found out that i have to eat what resembles watery oatmeal - and i\\'ve got to plug something into the back of my head @hungrysteven, timeout   @hungrysteven also, you probably need to look at how your approaching (globally) your exercises. in addition to the regex aspect, you need to find a way to test your code. (some people use the javascript console in browser, some run with node, etc.) but bouncing back and forth line by line with \"this\"? , \"how about this\"? is not going to help you in the long run (and will, likely, make people\\'s head(s) explode).   for now though, part of your problem is regex @hungrysteven goto http://www.regexr.com/.... you can experiment with patterns there do this for 20 minutes, the return then typing isn\\'t a js strong point (or point) sipping coffee sounds good @zac247  what kind of coffee are you drinking? waits for the answer because of @0x0936 \\'s shameless plug for the casual room lol well, we were talking about cheese dogs  so, anything not cheese dog related is generally frowned upon @qmikew1 can only imagine they totally ripped off japanese shows from the early 1970s welcome @sarunasp  @sarunasp many people feel silly saying \\'h e l l o w o r l d\\' the string is an argument to the function (tip) @kimkwanka , @jbmartinez is in laser focus mode but is not cooperating with my assessment of such lol it\\'s cheese-dog centric but can be general javascript is very lax about many things... but some things it\\'s not you can also, put a lot things within things (high degree of flexibility ) but have been used to strong (or actually exists) typing it\\'s problematic, in some ways with type coercion  if your present self and future self meet... it\\'s bad this is too deep. can we go back to cheese dogs, or regex? i can see (on the edges, and not fully developed) javascript\\'s approach (again, i could be wrong ...ask me tomorrow) and its power, but the \\'bad parts\\' i think will help with a fuller understanding there\\'s network stuff that creates delay you talk @shifthawke why are you recording yourself recording so, what\\'s the reason for jumping from room to room during twitch? well,  that was interesting it is, and has a great community there\\'s a toll charge for room changes @brianamarie thanks for the link (the other twitch was offline) heya @moh-aln  @jbmartinez  you might be able to switch up the flash settings :https://pubs.vmware.com/horizon-61-view/index.jsp?topic=%2fcom.vmware.horizon-view.desktops.doc%2fguid-8ce3908a-95b2-4d4d-9e00-b924e0d6d400.html @jbmartinez are you using firefox on this? try this: https://support.mozilla.org/en-us/questions/1009940 hiya @steven503  @camperbot you\\'re so vigilant  that\\'s totally lame @jbmartinez  @jedpimentel yes that\\'s why javascript has bolts in its neck twitch is totally flaking out on me loops before functions imo i\\'m afraid to use es6 stuff, it reminds me of vendor extension of functionallity for ff has it been fully adopted (i\\'ve seen a lot of stuff that i\\'d like to really use)? ugh the bane closures follows logically (of course) functions... but objects is easier to digest  sort of objects are make single page apps then do mondays suck in s. america too yeah, i haven\\'t even put anything in mine... @buzzlightyear90 , you\\'re way ahead in the game blender what\\'s the deal with links in twitch (i.e., why can you link references here (in gitter) but it\\'s more spammy in twitch)? there\\'s a chat feature in twitch; however, you can\\'t post links  hello @mashnew1234  @bomholt , there are sites where you can test.... (also, in linux there are test methods using set file sizes etc.) woodworking is very zen pizza dough, or denaro eating it is totally not (zen) - devour  energy it takes? you\\'d have to have an index somewhere @iheartkode  oh, i see why you were talking about hash earlier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1208222/how-do-i-implement-a-dictionary-or-hashtable-in-javascript i think, (i\\'m totally not following the convo) i think twitch did it to me corned beef hash is good too because i = 1 in the var and will always be <= 3 but you\\'re using \\'while\\' and yeah that breaks execution \\'return\\' agressive? i can\\'t even spell it so, totally doesn\\'t apply oh, yeah all bets are off then i love the random aggressive quote.. is there a middle finger emote? welcome @shawnwtx  heya @alphanuma  and @blakekeng too welcome lol js borrowed a lot of syntax stuff from different places (just to make your head explode) and c there\\'s was a couple of lessor know languages too known but don\\'t apply that to bash scripting @bkgeek lol, but should be ok in js i\\'m trying to absorb things in \\'vanilla\\' js before attempting es6 (although there\\'s some handy stuff in there) @bkgeek depends (although you should stick to one for consistency) ... i use quotes in different contexts with other stuff (besides js) i\\'m trying a new javascript infusion course... (you listen to subliminal javascript messages through water dripping and aerosmith) me either i knew there was a catch codecamp is filtered? that seems rather counterproductive  it\\'s very good the octopus metaphor (ok, in that context analogy) is applicable beyond variables in eloquent js turned off the stream a couple of hours ago it flaked on me are you still \\'twitching\\' (is that the verb for in session twitch.tv) what is that? what\\'s the purple thing? > sounds uncomfortable  ok, i\\'ve discovered some feature in gitter.... everything is highlighted in purple or pink wtf is that? welcome @carapeer  @shifthawke , are you going for some bf marathon? probably not able to respond because of the twitching @1234matt  was trying to follow your question no, it\\'s a bit open ended i think java was pushed a lot by some universities (cs departments) shortcuts?  haven\\'t found any (am still learning it (js) too). i think as you go along, you begin to pickup on the different philosophies being employed 1. it\\'s not java (unlearn some stuff). 2. data typing is sort of non-existent... 3. things live inside of other things (the potential nesting levels trip me out). 4. it\\'s a real language that\\'s no longer bound to traditional things the stream keeps crashing on my end @shifthawke  @1234matt that\\'s probably not very helpful; however, there are a lot of seasoned js folks that will probably give you some additional tips @1234matt it is smart to an extent.... but type coercion can be a problem i think it has to do with the flexibility of the language.... to me something as simple as mixed data types within an array is pretty new/profound howdy @lianliu  there\\'s the implicit declaration... it\\'s late, i think i\\'m losing some brain power here incoherent  are you on autopilot?  no, @jbmartinez ... but you could be as well, @1234matt :smile:  i used an emote oh, the decline @lianliu where are you in your learning....? looks good @salmanak  (pay particular attention to mark twain\\'s quote) there are so many way \\'smart people\\' can talk themselves out of greatness (it\\'s not always external (so, i\\'d break with twain a bit there) wow, no sleep and a busy monday = deep thoughts and emotes quick, cheese dogs or cats or a meme lol nice ty @iheartkode and @1234matt  the first cut in the mix is sort of floaty then totally harsh lol the monsta fellow, i think, was spurned at some point me? i\\'m totally not in europe....i\\'m in se u.s.a you\\'ve lost many hours that i still have... they have something called \\'daylight savings time\\' here...  it\\'s weird the atomic brain song (in mix) is pretty nice... electronica seems to have more of a swagger to it these days i mean you\\'re not actually saving daylight seems counter to internal (human) clock @1234matt whenever you can find the time @iheartkode the wicked sway clip is indeed wicked @iheartkode about 10:39 into the mix it\\'s called sodden or something there\\'s sort of an industrial hint to it against more of a hip hop beat hard to describe yeah @1234matt  i will have to sleep at some point wow, there\\'s this part where it sounds like droids are rebelling @shifthawke  you gotta listen to some of this mix of @iheartkode \\'s awesome @shifthawke  congrats the level counter needs to be reset  dupstep = not sleepy time music i can\\'t pause it (i mean i can, there\\'s no technical obstruction) math says: \\'all have come\\' although, i can understand the attitude towards math...  especially with soundtrack me either, maybe i\\'ll wait till later to address controller the regex is a bit off on that you have to put the hot pink reference in there  zombie css reference zombie cats the best i\\'m able to see in my mind\\'s eye the zombie cat concept (to be applied in some upcoming project) only because of this music of @iheartkode \\'s eptic track i think that\\'s \\'pro\\' version why do some codepens display with edit (which is good for troubleshooting) and some appear \\'compiled\\' (i.e., no edit option)... is there a setting that does this?  so, if wanted to evaluate (in most cases, folks have the edit option enabled (good) a pen that pops up with (\\'need feedback on this\\') i would need to be logged into codepen itself to control the view options of other pens? thanks @jbmartinez , @daynewr , @arielleslie  (just swap with*pen* in the actual url worked!) streaming is sometimes over used in corporate scenarios ironic lol what\\'s the point of the bonfire twitch (not a sarcastic question btw), like big picture? but the interaction doesn\\'t seem to be a front-end project type of interaction (i.e., just \\'as is service\\' ) like i\\'m typing this response, but i haven\\'t tweaked some gitter api to do it does that make sense? @brianamarie, i think the zipline portion will probably give me some insight... but the streaming can be multi-utility ... so, it\\'s throwing me off a bit your regex isn\\'t defined correctly ```\\nvar expression =  teststring.replace(/yourpattern/g,\"\");\\n``` heya @shivashinde  @federog the actual regex pattern is problematic. you may want to try http://www.regexr.com/ ^even better i dig that too i believe you can save your tests and share the url with others @shivashinde a new editor is in your future (there\\'s atom, brackets, sublime, geany, notepad++ (and a million other things)... to test your code, there\\'s a lot of options in that category as well... javascript console in browser... codepen.... running node... lots, and lots of options jsfiddle.net too (haven\\'t used it ( i like to run locally) welcome @angelchizy  i don\\'t know what\\'s worse: a bot or being annoyed with a bot when you know its regex patterns @shifthawke  = twitch diva (just kidding) @shifthawke , just giving you a hard time (you\\'ve adapted quickly, and are excelling - good stuff)  nooooo cra^ not camperbot and its brownies. i\\'m pretty sure that camperbot has, in fact, achieved self awareness no, pbot is camperbot\\'s evil twin wow, it picks up on the underlying command of that emote you could populate a separate array with a number (if your condition meets) and if that array is > 0  return whatever hello @aldraco  i think it was the saturday before last it would be handy (if it\\'s there already disregard) to have a section on the fcc homepage that has intuitive linkage to the update streams is there a general protocol (it\\'s all about the git) for this kind of stuff...(i.e., there\\'s a saying don\\'t complain unless you have a solution, which is really applicable in a dev/or aspiring-dev community)?  or a feedback preference or discussion type of thing... (this is sort of a hybrid political/tech question) ? but it\\'s not a bug oh, i see... there\\'s \\'open source\\' ; however, the master branch is somebody\\'s pride and joy. so, there\\'s kind of a in-built protocol that varies by branch master...i guess (in terms of comments)...  looks like steven tyler you didn\\'t know that handel was actually the frontman for aerosmith? brian may is absolutely awesome the mic on your machine is really sensitive, @shifthawke . i could hear crickets on that stream nice, go for it @aoxom  looks good @aoxom , but you need to fill in some js/jquery stuff to make bach have sith lightening come out of his fingers (with brandenburg concerto music wall) to make it interesting @mckmillions welcome, you\\'ll learn lots here @mckmillions what kind of coding were you, initially, drawn?  what i like, is this is really kind of a startup in itself...  i like modular projects (i.e., that over there is the thing you\\'re working (on), this over here is what i\\'m working (on)).... yes, i said it: i find pairing annoying lol @kunal-mandalia i\\'m more inclined to backend-dev... the front dev experience learning stuff doesn\\'t hurt totally @kunal-mandalia , that\\'s an interesting question... i\\'d say depends: the technical infrastructure behind things (in non-trivial enterprise level scenario) will never completely morph into a front end thing welcome @androidjim .... let me guess, you\\'re favorite mobile platform is ios based? lol (just kidding) you\\'re = your i am not special enough to have a working edit button there\\'s eloquent javascript that\\'s a good starter do you have an existing knowledge of js ? @wishe  i was asking because some of these books /series may be targeting advanced js \\'ninjas\\'... my recommendation  is to have the basics down first (and this is entirely subjective) before getting into the subtleties  crockford\\'s videos are great advanced and simple at the same time they\\'re for making s\\'mores and making your head explode (the bonfires are challenging and fun) is the twitch experience relatively stable for most viewers (it flakes out on me)? @shifthawke  stare at a file of gibberish characters for a few minutes, repeat. +1 for frank zappa @julianpalladino you can get a feel for how non-profits benefit (and indirectly what\\'s expected from a qualified candidate + what\\'s in it for you type stuff) by clicking the i\\'m a nonprofit button (just as a read type thing) i kind of view some of these paid bootcamps like a rush-rush truck driving program (i.e., learn to drive the \\'big rigs\\' in a week -- and make lots of money)  the volume of free resources (to learn anything) totally amazes me i do too - yep, you\\'re right @travishi  @trilliun , i\\'d be up front with them straight away... it will make the chances of success much greater. you\\'ve already secured an interview, there\\'s something that they see as an asset (don\\'t cram with lots of half baked stuff)   right before (imo) they pickup on that (i think your reasoning is sound) hiya @borivoje  you\\'ll get lots of js related stuff in this curriculum  there are extensions to sql functionality that vary by vendor plus, you need to know what kind of data you\\'re going to be working with (i.e., relational or non-relational) oh, lord lol @jbmartinez  is kidding folks ? like this very chat? i would suppose so (since conversation if by definition not predetermined)  oh, like a support chat i see what you\\'re saying sigh yes, let\\'s go back to 1960s file systems to store data that would be almost valid piping in linux except it would be somepowerpoint > myinsanelybadfile.txt well, i\\'m pretty sure sql tuning isn\\'t in your future there @davidamandoestrada  lol so, will i have to have a cart of money to by cheetos? buy by? like standing by cheetos great, i can\\'t type either unfortunately he knows this all too seriously  thanks for bumming him out lol camperbot... i know you\\'re not an actual person.... and i know the actual regex that you use, but seriously, can you just take a fu**en break once in a while? lol the bots in twitch are really bad i logged in for the first time recently moobot? who put  t a x as a form of \\'th a n ks\\'? lol  see? i have to space my characters out (as to not release the kraken) lol lol what\\'s that? yeah no, that vacum  cleaner? that\\'s the (classic) latin spelling of the cleaning device that that what\\'s that @shifthawke  ok, i\\'ll put on my anime face (how\\'s is this helping me exactly)? lol lol wow ok, don\\'t do that the full page thing bad or if you stand many yards back opaque you mean? totally reminds me of transparent gifs that were (and sadly still) used for spacing possum divs well it saves on storage, i think it\\'s what? 1x1 px yes, be bold... go complete table layouts lol i love websites that aren\\'t mobile responsive.... i\\'m like wtf? come on now... i see some still wow, 1000 and to a saint collages are pretty why would make fun of somebody who likes collages? you it\\'s not in svg.... so it will be all pixalated looking unless you get some obnoxiously expensive add-on for ps although, you could \\'re-create\\' it in all its fine detail glory ok, got a screenshot too you could put a pretty rose border around it lol hello two weeks from now what are you doing? do a seminar with a whiteboard i just realized twitch with t dropped is witch ahhh me too, it is one of the best tools ever hiya @majeye  they had a street fighter competition the same time as your twitch @shifthawke  that just sounds wrong don\\'t do it you\\'re not in the \\'learning zone\\'... if you attempt to do difficult tasks while exhausted (or perhaps, frustrated)... it tends to make eye (yes just one eye) bulge...  hmmm what side of equality  math is goo lol i saw that too late all the server farms and infrastructure and stuff... just to make it possible for camperbot to give brownies oh, yeah... i see all worth it not like blinking stuff on webpages in the 1990s no sir, but you shouldn\\'t be using that @jbmartinez  , remember?  totally it appears that there is some fly that turns honey bees into zombies... (as well as an alien like emergence of larvae ) -no joke, weird piece of news yeah, somewhere in rain forest  sure thing @vitolob  here\\'s a good one .lenthg why i love node and jslint the cli aspect looks very nice i\\'m bookmarking -- brownies for you: @jbmartinez  thanks @jbmartinez  yeah, i have a linter in brackets (that i\\'m still on the fence) but it\\'s quirky awesome..... brownies i haven\\'t attempted to do on mobile you\\'d almost have to (to be congruent) write code *for* mobile = ok... write code *on* mobile = torture i can\\'t see dev on a phone being a viable platform any time soon.... (yes, there are exceptions with tablet type stuff) the actual development. on... not the deployment yeah real keys are required.... (hence laptop is ideal) they were smaller in the old days.... (right after the motorola brick....there\\'s was competition to see who could come up with the smallest phones) well before the internet i can\\'t wait to carry my laptop sized phone on a belt  fanny packs (aka laptop sized phone carrier) will be all the rage once more oh, joy @jbmartinez  it\\'s funny you should mention sony.... i was listening to an interview about organizational behavior patterns... that allowed sony to pretty much drop the ball with music players and letting the ipod do its thing  so, to me ipod (and later phone) while revolutionary in marketing/timing etc., things like palm, and sony really came up with a lot of ideas yeah, i was sitting through the mandatory \\'how many seconds\\' ad on a youtube vid.. and there was this \\'jobs\\' trailer (yes, there\\'s a movie about the founder)... it was really kind of overboard in \\'apple created everything\\' cra^(again, sony... linux , palm and others even, dare i say it ms) what\\'s up with apple dropping apps from their store all the time, @kevsmets92 ? oh, that\\'s fun @perkyaayushi , there\\'s backend infrastructure that would make that less than viable as a repo type thing (i.e., per user stuff) what\\'s the purpose for copying and pasting? hello @gollodev  you\\'re forking an empty shell of functionallity.... you\\'re not forking the database contents (thank goodness) i would say that what you\\'re describing wouldn\\'t work ^ nice. welcome @resistorman  because you\\'re not cloning the backend database just the front end shell rock on @resistorman  don\\'t listen to camperbot all your stuff is saved that\\'s a lot of hours of streaming.... (getting into truman show territory) lol wow :metal:  the fcc shirt would be better without the description and just the logo (yes, i\\'m harping on this) @peazzoni1 you may want to display the operators in between the calcs the iconic aspects are lost @majeye  i really \\'love\\' how arrays are sorted (by default in lexicographical form even if they\\'re integers) in js welcome @ryanhduong  i want the two hours of my life back lol i would say the social (read community) aspect helps to keep one motivated... it\\'s kind of a unique fcc thing. @teejayparker you totally renamed yourself  that would be a good gratis project @shifthawke , that\\'s not a bad choice (because, a lot of this stuff is solitary and streaming can become \\'watch me cook eggs\\' or \\'here i am looking for baked chickens\\') lol will you be doing the baked chicken thing? har to the har i think that would be a compelling stream don\\'t steal my idea lol thinking in java and translating to javascript doesn\\'t work yes, totally... (however, some of the questions imply there\\'s some \\'thinking in java\\' going on) i know what it is and it isn\\'t i\\'m just saying... that you\\'ll go mad  with that approach but baked chickens are much more compelling either way hello @linkei  and welcome @jjlippman  @jjlippman good stuff. start on the exercises,  if you get stuck... there\\'s help available  type colon select from drop :heart_eyes_cat:  @housewar nice full metal jacket reference to your portfolio  i want the laser eye implant  top level (big picture) learning works for me (why i like crockford vids).... i need to know why i\\'m doing something (vs. a lot of disparate pieces of stuff)  although i run from recursion, and find nice comfy solace in iterative things...  not always, @kimkwanka  in can be non-performant @kimkwanka will if you\\'re going for code bling, i can\\'t disagree lol @timothyjt , give you a couple of hints (if you like) 1: you\\'re targeting a small subset of what\\'s considered punctuation (or other characters) 2: some characters are \\'fun\\' in regex (hope that\\'s not too cryptic) @timothyjt https://regex101.com and http://regexone.com/ will make your life easier bye @kimkwanka  @shifthawke if you\\'re going to demonstrate wapoints (as if they\\'ve never done), i think you can go to http://freecodecamp.com/map without logging in they\\'ve = were never done.. (i really need to fix my edit) #hello @jgtwo1  take that camperbot: my font is bigger than yours lol wait your mic is ultra sensitive don\\'t eat anything like beans no, that\\'s good usually people have the opposite problem  crickets tumbleweeds  what happened? welcome @jimburke1  so, you talked to one recruiter out of 900 billion  recruiters can be helpful; however, a lot are cheesy-shark types as well yeah, fcc is pretty new... i\\'m not sure that some industry bias has developed don\\'t let it derail your progress this recruiter sounds like they\\'re not very creative (or plugged in to innovation). you see they have to \\'sell\\' your skills etc., and if they don\\'t understand something... they\\'re going to poo poo it.  the last line is the takeaway  wow, it\\'s even quieter than before ... in here i\\'m still awake though well nothing like a timezone \\'touch base\\' how you interact with clients is as important as your technical competency  it can be frustrating to deal with lack of technical knowledge (with regard to clients), but put yourself in their shoes... when you get your car serviced , do you really give a cra^ about all the minutiae or do you just want it fixed/improved? because you didn\\'t var the pop\\'d array you get a free toaster at 200 @timothyjt  that\\'s a pretty nice toaster yeah, you couldn\\'t possibly affix bouncing eye stickers to a toaster yourself for under $1,000 here\\'s some brownie points to get you closer to the coveted toaster: thanks @timothyjt  nice if you\\'re talking about the functionality in the exercises, i\\'d say no... but you can paste your code what colors to they come? hash i could have sworn i saw something closer to -hash- 000099 @jctm30 i\\'m not familiar with the site but: https://pixabay.com/en/service/faq/ @briancbarrow do you have a codepen? for this  @briancbarrow , i saw a lot of target_blank stuff... maybe it\\'s because there\\'s no js click stuff or that it\\'s wrapped in just an anchor (maybe a form element would work  --) -- i saw the worked like a charm part (glad it worked) but when i refresh the pen it still doesn\\'t work  omg you\\'re not a robot @briancbarrow  lol yes, can confirm that it works  now you gotta work on the navbar @briancbarrow  @briancbarrow could be the resolution that i have window set but nothing is reoriented when home, about, portfolio, etc., is select.... (maybe is supposed to scroll or drop (i didn\\'t look at the underlying functionallity) selected @briancbarrow  i missed the place holder aspect, my apologies  @carl-parrish  i think that last test is factoring if you applied the regex correctly (thus removing the middle stuff) then it\\'s testing on integers only camperbot\\'s eyes should turn red when saying that yeah, what\\'s that? is it like some sort of talent pool thing (i.e., from which the large companies draw from contestants?) you\\'re supposed to kind of give the idea not the actual idea + execution *sigh* lol uh, huh what about the other 20,000 folks ? js is fun sometimes, sometimes it\\'s a serious pita it\\'s very lax on stuff (js) good and bad to that implicit typing has its pros cons too but you\\'d have to convert it to a string if you wanted to fix the decimal places there are just weird traps (i\\'m still on my js journey as well) that you run into  with js.... not bad/good... just weird at times here\\'s an example.... run a sort on an array filled with integers (i ran into this earlier today)... if you don\\'t pass argument/function within the sort, the default behavior is lexicographical (even on integers) you could split it by \"\" sorry the join part  i just try to help with general concepts but you\\'re going to want to split by something and then join into another array by \"\"  also, strings are immutable  http://regexone.com/ https://regex101.com is even better.... that was a fun bf there\\'s more fun bf fun ahead the general application would be http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp ; however, instead you\\'ll be using regex patterns whatever.replace(/somepattern/g, \"\") the did @figjeti , now they have stainless steel stuff on all the stoves and fridges i\\'ve seen some sites that still look 1995 and aren\\'t mobile responsive you\\'re going to have to chunk that out a bit and expand your regex to include as @hermanfassett says, other punctuation (or lack of ) ... you need to read up on the regex first perhaps, but having knowledge of it early on will give you \\'eureka!\\' much earlier in the game  there\\'s some irony there with camperbot and regex lol hiya @srinukatari  if you have to do any pre-processing of large files ( @primitivelogic ) the eureka! will come to you in an instant... case in point, (stipulate that there are specific tools for this) if you wanted to remove certain tags from a 10,000 line file how would you do that without regex (i.e., the tags have pattern but the contents are of different values) ? how would you solve it without regex then? (you can, but it\\'s just an example) what would it look like? air code it ok, return the values between all tags say<p></p> in a monster file of varying length of course i stipulated that iterate by line (could be a massive line) or by character? the tag thing is just for example... depends. if you\\'re using it in a stream editor... i can assure you that it\\'s not using the overhead of manually looping through each character in a js loop if you\\'re writing something that is wholly inefficient with gobs of conditionals with line upon line of something (that may not even work) and that is not performant, that isn\\'t a sign of good programming but its inclusion in tutorial (here and elsewhere) argues against that in javascript, not long... in general, since the 1980s  how about you? btw nobody is saying one has to be some regex guru... it\\'s the knowledge of it that is powerful (if embraced even to a minimal extent - if not, do whatever...) if i have to create gitter before i can use gitter (every time i use it) or fashion a wheel (just for the problem solving aspects before driving a car) doesn\\'t make me a genius  it\\'s weird, you never know what topic sparks spirited debate which is tastier.... turkey or chicken? what is it a matter? do you hand file each bolt? because the car will have cost overrun  there are levels of abstraction that i think are being missed in the philosophical approach (which is what @0x0936  is getting at i think) if you\\'re interviewing for a position and you have 700 lines of code where it could have taken 20, do you think the person evaluating would say \\'this person is the best\\'? battery no worky long. here\\'s the answer to my own question: \\'no\\' @shifthawke it seems that you grew a beard and were streaming under the fcc tampa cummunity last night lol community gitter has some spell check flaws @bschaden you may be on to something in terms of sequence http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_system.asp eww oh, no not paranormal html @ushankhan  did the same thing with javascript (i.e., \\'jscript\\') early on i think i may still have your tour i can pm it (with formatting) if you like @shifthawke   which would be 99.9% not probable for a first time \\'hello world\\' @allanarmstrong lol wow , there\\'s a translation room? @sammi-93 what\\'s the issue? amen welcome @yragc80  or pink shoes in general? too, bad it will help your coding captain america... he has some sort of powers (kind of like wolverine sans the claws) well, if you have batman like in a bar without all of his batman stuff... and superman... i think i know who would win i mean superman flew around the world at high rate of speed to reverse time. a batman utility belt seems to pale in comparisson well, that\\'s really a product of stretching the bounds to make for good story (i.e., the new movie premise of batman vs. superman). taken to the logical extreme, you could have batman vs. jesus there\\'s more to the superman story (i.e., other than marlon brando sending him off in a space capsule (which i guess could be some weird metaphor of wheat field) ?? form of \\'tub of ice cream\\'....  what was their mascot\\'s name oh, you didn\\'t see the \\'new cap\\'... he looks like weird al\\'s take off on bad the monkey\\'s name was gleek? oh, i think you\\'re right @jbmartinez (without even googling) i haven\\'t heard that word in a couple of decades #gleek sounds a lot like phil hartman\\'s frankenstein character @shifthawke keeps downing my idea about a new super hero named troutman there\\'s a what? i don\\'t that\\'s a superhero  not cap the other ewwww that\\'s eel man wtf is that really a superhero? where are you getting retval? i assume nothing heya @c0d9x  there\\'s no loop setup there i\\'m doing bonfires (i got really sidetracked with angular - and redoing progress from changeover) how do you like it so far? @c0d9x  syntax errors are the best @arielleslie that\\'s so true (kind of like using \\'to\\' where \\'too\\' should be used: would never register) don\\'t skip the html... it\\'s the backdrop but i get it. i wanted to get right to js yep brownies are the perfect cavity vector: they\\'re full of cra^ and they stick to your teeth but oh, so good yes, yes.... you get it hang on test thanks @aalve  yes, and only for the sake of brownies see, and it also registered the brownies you had (when you couldn\\'t see those i\\'m really annoyed that octopus adoption at mall kiosks is under represented  sure dogs and cats are cute and all.... but the octopus always is the one left hiya @ivojercic  @arielleslie not sure, but i see some cap. kirk in that main character totally the loop looks problematic (imo) you want to run your comparisons inside the the loop... (i.e., give the loop iterator some room to do its job of just being, well, a \\'looper\\') which i\\'ve heard is very tasty with lemon hi, @notableotter  this weird on a mobile device it\\'s a totally different experience. it sucks ok, my \\'journey with gitter  (and to some degree, fcc) on mobile \\' sucked. so, back to laptop i feel whole again lol shutter and ksnap (if you\\'re kde) are good if you want to crop before you paste  https://docs.c9.io/discuss/557ecf787eafa719001d1af8 (use with care) @imransb ah, my edit functionality is back again heya @vitolob and @dorafo  let\\'s see if edit is working oh, yeah! nice... finally it was not working for a couple of weeks @vitolob http://www.regexr.com/ https://regex101.com i\\'ve tried the gitter app (linux version) and found no compelling reason to use it over the browser based version (in fact, some stuff doesn\\'t work as well) @welldressed , you don\\'t need (but helps ) any prior knowledge looks like an ad codeacademy\\'s basic js is really bad (other offerings, not as) sure feel locked into some sort of drone existence? like camperbot ? oh, yeah... the \\'bobs\\' scene is so close to reality of the late 1990s  and today glengarry glen ross (although, slightly different \\'always be closing\\') you can look at the repo @welldressed  there are differences between git and organizational stuff (which is true of pretty much everything) points were carried over i believe (at least in my case) @v3rse  i.e., when the beta went production (a couple of months ago?) the map looks different (there\\'s new stuff)... and you\\'ll have some stuff checked already etc. np we\\'re not worthy, we\\'re not worthy lol that happened to me too @kimkwanka  (even though node was practically yelling at me \\'hey, you idiot there\\'s no such thing as .lngth\\') gitter lagging like crazy camperbot is not  a guy and self aware you could say shlang instead of slang dhingbwatus wif kwawacters i like it let\\'s build the dictionary lol bye @stimpygato  does gitter \\'flake out\\' on anybody at times? (weird lags etc.) @jbmartinez yeah, maybe it\\'s all of the various embedded stuff that contributes  console.log  won\\'t return anything for function output help formatting back on mobile. yea did you lose your tour again uh huh you should add cat emote oh yeah good stuff make sure you have parachute pants handy am on mobile did i mention im on mobile loo help formatting im pretty limited to just invoking the evil camperbot when on mobile @shifthawke you did another stream? how did it go nice need more designers with that mindset😀 for some reason i thought entertaining could probably describe the streams without even seeing it moths  and snorting dogs they always add to the web experience second only to cats voice to text is so weird yeah i\\'m on a mobile (totally sucks) and i\\'m talking to text so some random expletive blurts out it\\'s the processor not me always the processor do you guys put real data and your portfolios in not from the bs perspective but more as a privacy thing collective crickets chirp, chirp that makes it better some people eat crickets chocolate covered if starbucks old am i now i sound like yoda stupid processor what i meant to say was if starbucks sold them i would buy them yeah exercises are interesting and often send you in different directions for learning i had to go the route of anonymous functions yes i would eat chco crickets webbed footed greeting to you. welcome hiya @ggaroian  @teejayparker that\\'s neat (i.e., giphy\\'s media controls for, well, animated, gifs) smooth control transition on hover (nice) hi @jrowings  hi @ushankhan  @jrowings that\\'s a great reason... ! (and really honest) when you fix the href, you still have to change its value to make a dead-link @faseehx  congrats @allanarmstrong  @allanarmstrong (honestly, the backend dev stuff holds a lot of interest imo) @waterburner is that a cat version of jack sparrow? am more inclined to the backend aspect as well np at the rate technology is changing, i predict the microwave oven will be too slow not sure what you\\'re trying to do... but you may want to use .length on both strings if you\\'re trying to compare which is greater in length.  (also, \\'ls\\' is a common directory command in *nix systems) @vayl  @kkrzakk ubuntu i guess today is a bad day to sign up with/for codepen? oh, so you\\'re the one? that\\'s ok, there\\'s lots on the \\'sign-up\\' list (thinking about heroku) http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/codepen.io.html proof that @falsedave did, indeed, break codepen i haven\\'t gotten to the \\'god\\' zipline yet yeah, i saw that in google results (fcc) yeppers i always wonder what the reason is when sites go down (given there are redundancies etc.,) especially with sites that host code etc. doesn\\'t brackets use preview within browser (extract)? yes, i\\'m sure the claims folks were happy with you lol you know you have to relax a bit when you\\'re evaluating your baker\\'s code that is a seriously tasty looking cake  yeah i lost two hours figuring out the lexical sort (even on integers)  a couple of days ago... painful learning experince any thoughts on ruby (subjective, yes)i was looking at code curriculum (hint: run by thor\\'s father) and they seem to be really focused on ruby/rails  if you paste your code, it makes it easier to evaluate @boris-chantel  @arielleslie , i\\'m envisioning your ruby experience (context part) as some sort of westside story gang you have monospace on paragraph element(s) @newmand what waypoint is that? (directions give context) you would think camperbot would have more brownie points (sarcasm brownies) that might be better in a codepen backticks = bread code = turkey make the code sandwich one person can\\'t be a team of professionals nice (imo, you should change \\'i am a team of professionals\\' - just sayin) i saw this placeholder once \\'i eat squirrels\\' and the dev forgot to change it (ok, i\\'m kidding)  @jedpimentel lol @meatzie, welcome good luck @danielhulot  ambiguous question   i\\'m filling in about 20 different (what could be ) responses in my mind although, it could be mobile related... i tried this (gitter) on mobile with text-to-speech. i sounded like yoda. problems you will have with bootstrap, yyyyes, hmph i want to like brackets (like some have said) it\\'s a bit buggy i will say (in comparison to other(s) sublime is closer to \\'no bs\\' than brackets (geany is my goto) whoever mentioned hamburgers...thanks a lot  without the bread, just the hamburger i went back and redid the waypoints (i.e., new version.... where already completed in old).... wasn\\'t a big deal. some stuff was saved, so where there was a 1:1 it should show. but i signed up on the cusp and had to do codecademy\\'s basic js (which sucks to no end) yeah, if this was recently (i.e., waypoints progress) then ^ is applicable... i\\'m referring to those (like me) that signed up before the major update seen a few \\'haven\\'t been here for awhile (like months)\\' questions which is good (the homegrown stuff is better). http://freecodecamp.com/news/fcc-success-stories (haven\\'t read those, though) mileage may vary @codenonprofit yeah, i should have double-checked that (it\\'s one of the first search results)... looks as though it\\'s in camper news then sort of co-opts fcc logo   to somebody\\'s personal page i haven\\'t checked in a while... but i live close to rtp (research triangle park), and was surprised there weren\\'t any local meetups  yeah, but then i\\'d have to bring mixed nuts and coffee lol how do meetups work? (beyond the start--one procedure) ... i.e., what makes for a productive city/semi-regional meetup? you probably (aside from question) want to name your variables something other than array  hello @osnapitzjen  @jettcrowson , @takumar is correct... about the loop... (in fact, it will throw an error) have you considered (if you\\'re already doing, then disregard) testing your code in javascript console (or other means)? *may make things easier to sort out* heya @daiky00  welcome @divya-projects  for whatever reason, the community just \\'works\\' (i.e., it\\'s a great community) the soothing sound of the dial-up modem you\\'re not supposed to say that out loud lol i bet that it\\'s expensive to advertise on stack exchange (because you have an audience of nerds & ultra-nerds) @elektropay stack exchange is your friend not the loser drunken friend.... but your smart friend @jbmartinez i actually stopped for a moment and thought about their revenue model...  have you ever looked at the job board (have noticed it but never clicked it) ? is it any good @jbmartinez , not bad (just looked)... aside, from the ads...i saw a company that went to angular camperbot i was just saying camperbot (without particular invocation), (if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing lol) you could make it even better @javiermxmd : \\'undefined\\' (i.e., nothing, nothing) hi @shoichiaizawa  lol @abhisekp, yes... i know you work on camperbot  as much as i dis camperbot....it does interest me apple is sort of becoming the new ms (total irony)  yeah, i can see the visionary aspects... but this new movie (about jobs -from what i\\'ve seen in preview) goes over the top... with crediting (jobs) with everything under the tech sun (when all kinds of stuff came before)  although, i saw somewhere that somebody had/auctioned one of steve jobs\\' early business cards...(having something like is neat whether you\\'re an apple fan or not) heya, and howdy @heal25  @abhisekp i think you\\'re right about brackets (i think i\\'ve been using it around two weeks), it is kind of buggy... but still useful (with array of others) nice how does it feel? @jbmartinez i might just do that  i seriously have to upgrade my node version.... (it looks like they have an expiration date on packages that go back x time) that\\'s one of the things about ubuntu repos,  they have stale versions of a lot of things (love ubuntu/debian... but when it\\'s true, it\\'s true) @jbmartinez i ran an *apt-cache policy* on it .... and it\\'s so bad that... i\\'m downloading the the tar.gz file now.... 4.2.1  - @jbmartinez haven\\'t tried nvm  ... how has it worked for you? japanese = serenity corn chowder....  yeah, but there\\'s a lot of disagreement (japanese vs. chinese speakers).... i get \\'no, that means this\\'.... kanji (originally) comes from chinese characters  bye @abhisekp  @jbmartinez , does nvm work out for you ? oh, you already responded to that not to change the subject, but i tried this delicacy known as \\'potted meat\\' well, i don\\'t know exactly...have always been afraid of it there are some foods that you really want to avoid reading the ingredient list @allanarmstrong well, now you understand the apprehension  are meetups sort of a networking thing? (i\\'m really kind of on the fence about it) @jbmartinez nvm looks to be a bash script (so, easy to see what it\\'s doing) i wonder if the current node version has any effect on (i would guess not but... but it might be passing some args) i might just install this 4.2.1 and clone... nvm and see what happens (not that i\\'m a node expert..... just started using it) hi @mengedeth  bye @jbmartinez  -than -  (if you\\'re going to dis at least make it readable)  nooo @faseehx  @teejayparker (not to detract from the debate that\\'s going) you totally went corporate avatar what happened? lol @faseehx ,  not everything can be boiled down to fun. coding is hard (and fun too), you have to put the work into it  @johnny34 typos get all of us. trust me, you\\'re not stupid welcom @cslice18  welcome i\\'ve sworn off grammatically correct sentences for the morning regex needs to be tweaked bach! @aoxom looks good what\\'s the background? is it parched scoring sheet? @aoxom  that is true, i found myself wondering if the image footer would collapse or do something (has kind of a weird visual effect - but still looks good) if you don\\'t learn.... you have a 100% chance of failure it\\'s self doubt (it\\'s ok, push through it) lol or they\\'re written by recruiters who inject their own bias  i saw this one skills blurb by a recruiter (attached to the bottom of listing).... he/she went to great lengths to disparage javascript in favor of \\'real languages\\' (not exactly the verbage but message was clear) before even clicking the pen (and thus the question), white font (even with drop shadow) on white background = hard on the eyes i have the full pen preview... drop shadow bad! (says in phil hartman character voice) @duanwalker ok, let me actually look at the question that you asked lol @duanwalker  the get location by ip link returns flakey results, but how are you using that in context of the weather api link (doesn\\'t appear to be fallback, but is conflated)? @duanwalker  \\'$.getjson\\' might be a good way  @duanwalker , sorry i got sidetracked on the ip implementation (not your question) - i\\'ve seen other pens (very similar) that resolve city.. @duanwalker sorry, i\\'d have to re-write stuff just to get it to display my city (so, i can\\'t see/test)... will have to throw this to somebody else oh, look at that... codecademy wants me to learn java i don\\'t want to go down the java road, i wonder what\\'s driving their (codecademy) course offerings no, can\\'t be that @arielleslie yes, that makes sense... but why now? @arielleslie just kind of a weird deployment direction course wise (like you would have thought the opposite to be true)... @arielleslie if you go back some years,  \\'java\\', \\'c++\\'...were sort of \\'hot\\'  @arielleslie so, i\\'m wondering about the underlying demand flow (i.e., is there some sort of a rebirth in trend driven by (x)... ) you\\'re missing my point @alanbuchanan  lambda is not lost on javascript yes, \\'learn java\\' is what you\\'ll hear (no doubt about that) @arielleslie   yes, learn javascript.... it\\'s the anchor in the stack  welcome @austinmoore21  lol @storbeck  yes, the lack of strict typing hangs me up as well yes, @jaiminf  the syntax is borrowed from a million different places (but without the implementation)...for me part of where i run into problems is trying to think in one thing and apply it to js. the key, imo is that it has its own philosophy (good, bad, whatever) congrats @slolobdill44  it\\'s hard to be frustrated when there are cats make it so #1 does js lack of hash drive anybody crazy? those are tasty i\\'m still evaluating brackets @iheartkode it is totally, but sometimes it gets buggy @iheartkode yep i\\'ve got to update my node.... but i think i\\'ll \\'npm\\'  the browser sync heya @d227wang  i you\\'re the same person.... i commend you on your multi-user names (and \\'distinct personalities\\')   porkchop mixins? hi @quincylarson  @storbeck it has sort of a virtual machine feel to it (brackets) hard to expain that part is neat but wait, there\\'s more lol i should have been able to guess quicker (activity pane right for repo) very nice... (user won\\'t have to \\'search in dark\\', in terms of context (then can focus on issue vs. where to find)) @jbmartinez yeah, i saw that too ok, now i\\'m in the \\'slide-out\\' chat window.... wow, very slick and, you can expand back to the \\'native\\' gitter interface...  heya @sergistud  i think node is a dependency of brackets (i.e., it communicates over socket)  which reminds me (all of this discussion) i need to update node version @jamar0813 we\\'ve been waiting for you, welcome. lol why not both? meme i haven\\'t gotten to the task runners part yet... yeah good question @iheartkode  thanks @iheartkode .... i have to say \\'using streams\\' really caught my eye doh, you beat me to it @josephwasily another thing you\\'re going to need to account for is that a lot of  id(s) are dynamically generated (so, * in part of string search might help- but there are a lot of tools for this, and as @saintpeter says it\\'s really not trivial) @namsir the spin effect when you click the button is neat... (how do you reset?) -overall works on my end what\\'s the mechanism to reset the timer? (i.e., you click and it pauses (which is good)) @jbmartinez i still have this tar version (latest) of node,  i\\'m thinking before i install this i should run an apt-get purge on the current (stale ubuntu repo) version, ```\\n<!-- fyi (i learned this from other folks here)\\nif a codepen example is displayed in \\'full view\\',\\nyou can change \\'to pen view\\' by altering url\\n\\nhttp://codepen.io/someuser/full/somepenid/\\n                                                             ^ change this\\n\\n\\nhttp://codepen.io/someuser/pen/somepenid/\\n                                                             ^ to this \\n\\nthen you can evaluate the code etc., \\n-->\\n``` doh, gitter markup.... messes with spaces, grrrr does gitter (markup) have anything like <pre> ? have you finished all of curriculum benchmarks @erickpezoa ? @erickpezoa, i don\\'t have any unique insight (so, others here would probably be better to answer). but the the exercises, projects, etc.,  are the path (i.e., tangible items) to the non-profit projects.   gitter sort of infers that full markup (beyond the gitter markup) is supported https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200176682-markdown-basics  --i can\\'t find the secret welcome @rjshaver  i suppose i could always just do a screenshot of text if i wanted to guarantee indentation retention  thanks myself (no camperbot, i can\\'t thank myself) lol what do nerds do on saturday? (nvm) lol camperbot is really eager to contribute i wonder if the distinction relates to the early implementations of js (i.e., it was for all intents and purposes bound to browsers (yes, there\\'s was actionscript, blah..blah) i\\'m convinced its early implementation was environment based relating to \\'no classes\\'  where\\'s the sandwich, again? also, there\\'s new functionality...if you\\'re on a bonfire page and click chat.... you\\'re taken to the applicable help you know the discussion (no classes in javascript  comes up a lot (whether you\\'re on the semantic or non-semantic side of argument)... i wonder if this would be a good tech interview question to be able to explain  i\\'m guessing so too (never good in that (interview) situation to be buh, buh, buh,\\'ng  your lips ) lol great more cra^ on the list (belated) hi, @slofty  @vaghawan what kind of issue are you experiencing ? @vaghawan aside from your question, you might want to change the message location (i.e., the one that says \\'you\\'ve clicked (n) button)... it covers the buttons you\\'re supposed to select. (is that prompting your question?) are you trying to clone? hi @khurramn  trying to catch up on caffeine  i run linux, but maybe this https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/484 has something to do with the slow... issue (don\\'t have any ideas about the specs etc., so, just a guess) .btn-trigger vs. *.btn-triger* maybe? @jdieter12  there is *only one* web dev position in your geographical area? (problem we should have lol) @scissors61 , you might have to do some intermediate (pre-processing steps) https://gist.github.com/faisalman/4213592 -  this will get you to hex, then it\\'s up to you that sucks howdy @cuent  @amodsureka good luck!  batperson @shifthawke be really careful with cpu..... if upgrading (e.g., on a board that supports better)... cpu is not forgiving... (gpu not as bad) i\\'ve had good luck with corsair welcome @fauker , @nikhataly  human responses trump bots any day bob i think that voids warranty  works great (only thing (not that it matters) the \\'you think too much\\' static part creates a \\'text on text\\' presentation, that makes it hard to read)  http://www.regexr.com/ - https://regex101.com brad hamilton: (regex) right. learn it. know it. live it. good fun @pong324 advice that\\'s probably not going to go anywhere: @shifthawke is building a gaming rig really? i.e.., really? to the duckett book well, i guess break dancing while holding a duckett book is out of the question yeah it sucks now what? @anant1271 i would change to the font color on \\'novice coder\\' to something else (too close in range to the background image)....(and probably just as a style thing never refer to your own work (even indirectly) as simplistic.... other than that love the look! (sorry the hyperlink (default blue) i meant is close in range....(so maybe the image, oh...nvm) @anant1271 , if you\\'re viewing in a larger screen (non mobile), there\\'s no intuitive way to navigate once you\\'ve made a selection from navbar (you\\'re taken to middle of page, but then have to scroll-home) i think so, @psykobilliethekid , i noticed a new hour indicator (last few days to week) next to the sections and there is a new (wp, bonfire, zip...etc.) context specific chat feature. avatar - a new romance. (wait, somebody already took that title) lol you can in your browser (copy paste) or you can use other tools @rarezik , the bonfires are (can be) challenging... it sort of marks the point where\\'s there\\'s less hand holding. there\\'s a a help room if you get stuck what are you invoking again? just don\\'t invoke \\'the bot\\' rhymes with camperbot don\\'t do it @storbeck are you really going to start blogging (i saw the question earlier about medium)? (nice (s)css animation btw) imo sounds like a bad idea @nickysavage  no boot camp (charging any amount) is going to give you that @nickysavage ... and you can hang with fellow nerds what is it nerd pretending to be a geek shrouded in a metaphor?  gerken gerken\\'stein lots of arrays (see a trend ?) @travishi  those are tasty with pasta don\\'t let @travishi fool you @shifthawke .... it\\'s simply a pasta booster  noooooooooo sigh hiya @francisngo  bye @nickysavage  @shifthawke  did it turn frickin cold where you are? sucks ? https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ wow, it is pretty reasonable (<--hopes that i\\'m not getting sucked into some sort of promotional thing) i looked at the pricing plan on individual... doesn\\'t look too bad wow there\\'s a node.js room it does that the gitter sign in integration with fcc on mobile works a little too well i\\'m thinking the question/response time (here) is going to be what interplanetary gitter will be like (once we get around to landing on mars) lol  matt damon\\'s character\\'s issues stemmed from starring repos  oh, great... now i\\'m on a nerd quest... (what is the radio signal delay between earth and mars ) ? http://blogs.esa.int/mex/2012/08/05/time-delay-between-mars-and-earth/ @arielleslie that\\'s in the ballpark. i haven\\'t seen movie. is it any good? or pulling lol i\\'d be interested in the technical elements... but on the human story side, i wonder if it\\'s a mars version of castaway @demetrig it hangs on loading googleanalytics (and like @kirah1314 states, there\\'s an alert in js) if it hangs in pen view, i\\'m not loading the full view @demetrig, using jquery might be easier... your issue is with the button itself (your quotes, are sound (in fact, they will display on load)...  hey @medi86  most people keep a reference handy some js videos (on youtube) are actually good...\\'only functions have scope\\' (es5)... i was wondering why i see trees of functions are you getting an error message? @steph88  huh, are you blocking js with an extension? (i know @jbmartinez asked this) firefox has the best dev tools  i use chrome (chromium) and ff doh, beat me to it... (firebug) also, there\\'s also an ide tool that you can make projects with different runtimes (e.g., the ff mobile (think sizing), and browser) just... caution as the projects are particular about external stuff there are also (and this is not exclusive to ff) json viewers (this will come in handy later) yeah, i broke from the \\'extension\\' category for a moment there @jbmartinez lol @steph88  is the issue re: not being able to complete the exercise, still active/happening? actually, you know @jbmartinez had a point earlier about antivirus programs (windows)... sometimes they install extensions into the browser itself another windows \\'gem\\' (although, in this case it\\'s the antivirus co.... but points back to windows either way) lol thanks for the links @iheartkode , @0x0936  rock on, @jnandez1986  welcome @z30136  how is your maxpart var not throwing an error? @arielleslie , didn\\'t see an accompanying array var matching the argument the three dots throw an error of unexpected token.... (i can see math.max(arr); working)... in both console... and running node (sorry for the side, convo/distraction) .. (i\\'m talking about the literal argument in op\\'s code sample)... i\\'ll look this up for edification purposes (for me that is) @giraffeattack , i\\'m on the fence about setting flag (which i heard about recently) to es6 in node except the exercises may not support it (i don\\'t know this for sure)... hence, i stay closer to \\'vanilla\\' js when doing these awsome. welcome @mikealbo  i found the opposite to be true (i.e., gitter totally flakes after awhile) i think it\\'s all the embedded media/code (gitter wise) that requires need to refresh page occasionally   you can learn code at any point in your life that depends on you (i\\'m not a fortune cookie bot - i promise) sup @iheartkode  yeah, was going to say https://repl.it/languages/javascript (but i use node locally) @kimkwanka that\\'s pretty sharp fearful coding? sounds like a game show idea tons of questions is good except firebase lol they have one: crashed browser lol (yes agree too) unless you\\'re working on a very large file (which js would probably be wrong tool in first place), if your code hasn\\'t finished executing <1min (even less so, really) there\\'s a problem @iheartkode sounds like a good project... like a pre-step to actually running the code  sorry < 1 min grrr looks like ibm has sort of the idea about catching js infinite loops in their services: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssfpjs_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tadm_javascript_loops.html @xeoneux i agree, it should be a matter of seconds then terminate process.... day here or late afternoon i\\'m convinced that deep frying adds flavor to anything you can try deep frying water @ukchukx ; however, the reaction might not be what you expect (disclaimer: never put water near hot oil... it will splatter/burn) well, @ukchukx there\\'s tang, crystal lite, etc.,  i\\'m digging the ravioli in that link welcome @lucidruss  at first glance i thought screen-name was the rapper  very nice, @powerjohn  congrats! regex is useful for a lot of stuff you can strip out whatever chars (e.g., like you state sanitizing) you like (for example formatting phone # s) but regex is much more powerful than that it\\'s wicked useful (and language agnostic) http://www.regexr.com/ -and -  https://regex101.com np :smile:  yes, there are different flags (for example in bash scripting) but it is the same concept across all languages when i speak about regex, i feel as though i\\'m quoting darth vader \"you don\\'t know the power of the dark side\" darth vader? i still have to update node (have a really stale ubuntu repo version) i\\'d have to apt-cache policy it.... but ubuntu, (depending on release type) is not a rolling distro why i should have just installed from .deb in first place yes, mint is a rolling distro (and is a derivative of deb/ubuntu)... but ubuntu itself ism isn\\'t rolling releases, kind of scare me i tend towards the lts versions (stability -- but there\\'s a compromise there) but can always through the \\'bleeding edge\\' stuff in a vm and experiment through = throw i used mint a few years back... not a bad distro yeah, i can understand that.... i use kde (with ubuntu) and sometimes fallback to gnome or mate desktop.... but kde really has grown into my workflow heya @lukeghenco  @recodeexistance isn\\'t that slot supposed to be enclosed in brackets? ```\\n//let\\'s use the jquery selector $(\".slot\") to select all of the slots.\\n//\\n//once they are all selected, we can use bracket notation to access each individual slot:\\n//\\n//$($(\".slot\")[0]).html(slotone);\\n\\n//=========^\\n``` gitter reformatted my caret i don\\'t know if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for....  is the chat (i.e., integration with gitter) option in fcc homepage navbar down? welcome @prasannaramamoorthy  weak type throws me (especially when i see \\'on-the-fly variables\\') totally valid... but have to wrap mind around sometimes @lifeburner js might actually concatenate that as a string operation as 420 yeah, but you\\'d go broke if you had a checkout total that = 420 vs. 24 don\\'t fear it (js) if you understand it (which i\\'m still on journey)... it\\'s really powerful like assembly? sure, but isn\\'t there a distinction between levels of abstraction? haven\\'t heard of this programming ritual of which you speak (mine is pretty limited to coffee and some sugar laden thing) actually, my first introduction was a slight variant in a metallica song in the late 80\\'s  so, not completely wasted  ^yep why power over memory management is good and bad jumping to c a little here <-- has to actually finish \\'c\\' book oh, no i\\'m sure there\\'s some nerd behavior study in progress well, if it\\'s in progress... i\\'m sure i\\'ve been included in the nerd sample no, that would infinitely summon @lifeburner  you will get a runtime error @arielleslie is total nerd (so i\\'m guesing \\'the no love for geeks\\' is not applicable) lol @rselover , your resolve will be tested when you \\'meet the bonfires\\' the initial lessons (imo) are a way to transition to the actual programming stuff...

(i.e., a cable that\\'s faster than what can be transmitted (or received/processed) between say an external drive and another machine)...  i don\\'t think usb type-c has even had a chance to be adopted (as an aside lol) great i login to gitter and get a \\'c:\\\\\\' prompt lol it\\'s kind of like a frame/guide (imo) here\\'s the general stuff you need to learn, here\\'s some general examples... now go research/repeat (so, yeah get out of it what you put in) i\\'m just here for the memes and chicken fries lol @shifthawke  i would answer but this animated gif is distracting me it\\'s hypnotic amazon should use that just to go back (a ways) i agree, @shifthawke new batwoman , not so great might be artificial intelligence  i\\'m pretty sure the pope is not fighting street crime himself (well, there\\'s the chance...oh, nvm lightening i\\'m sure will strike) i must say, those are some serious meme chops there ok, i\\'m going to try to stop laughing now i\\'m sure the next pc mag article will use this snapshot in time as their next screenshot of gitter (for article) you\\'re jumping back and forth between java and javascript? how does your head not explode? there are still a lot of .net shops on the surface i\\'d agree... but i think there\\'s a distinct philosophy with js that can\\'t be wrapped in the construct of other things are you running reporting stuff through java? there\\'s a lot reporting stuff that uses java.... (think jaspersoft) nice, @crisberrios  sounds like a great gig sure there are still a lot of scenarios where a sql server backend with some sort of java reporting layer (or if you must ssrs) makes sense in some applications...... wait, you lost me.... is this aarp coding (not that it can\\'t be, or there\\'s anything wrong with that) ? you never want to see a horse make that face, trust me  if you\\'re freelancing, you have to have a lot of executive level skills (apart from programming) ^ that\\'s interesting, one thing that i think is missed is you\\'re not necessarily going to have creative control over things ... you may be part of a dev team or... there will be specs by client.. (so, you\\'re not always going to be in creative xanadu land) tech isn\\'t just limited to creative mobile apps or snazzy this, snazzy that.... there\\'s a lot of \\'boring\\' (which isn\\'t so boring) that keeps companies/orgs churning along in their respective missions yeah, i tried for the \\'killer app\\' by way of the deep fried squid timer for mobile... didn\\'t work out like a tazer phone?  that is totally a great app idea or taser i like the deep fried squid timer better but that\\'s just me welcome @cannelflow  yes, \\'rm\\' in bash is a bad thing when not used correctly (or worse yet, with admin privs) there you go @lifeburner yes, i\\'ll get right on that starting with /  lol pigs in space! totally i was just thinking that how wrong is that? they were an unlikely pair... kermit was so reserved and miss piggy was a total diva...

(i.e., its \\'profile\\' raised) oh, i just caught the logic (i.e., it\\'s a scrape of chat profiles)... i was wondering out of huge userbase you could get leaderboard stats like that.... (it\\'s cool though, no doubt) i feel less bad now (i\\'m 126999th out of 127000) ty, ty but what if my question is: \"do you have the three piece meal in extra crispy\"?  (am i still the answer?) sorry, i\\'m usually \\'all about the deep quotes\\'; however, being 126999th out of 127000 on the leaderboard is bumming me out lol you didn\\'t see it ? (i\\'m just kidding a bit, it\\'s based on chat scapes so the sample isn\\'t that big) it\\'s a neat project that somebody created @dting just posted (a link of) it.... here\\'s the link http://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/ there\\'s a lot of neat stuff (ton of resources) that you can learn in the curriculum and community (just a free plug unrelated to anything) it happens i don\\'t think you have to spend a huge amount for sound card (unless you\\'re doing some serious media server thing) @shifthawke browser newegg browse grrrr i can\\'t type/spell sha na na @dting , yeah i looked at the bottom of the board... (because i was trying to wrap my mind around how you could rank a huge sample etc., then noted that the sample was limited to stats within active participants in chat) it\\'s a neat idea (makes me want to sort of look into gitter api.... (i see a lot of different stats being pulled for different experiments....) browse the newegg, browse the newegg ( @shifthawke ) or not look at the reviews @shifthawke  (yeah, you have to go through each etc) but they\\'re starred a new version of application has been deployed click here to reload.....

(have been for awhile... it might stay) @darrylpargeter i\\'ve heard that (keyboard only input (with shortcuts) ) is wicked fast @darrylpargeter total.  lol use nano on the fly but nothing heavy  do those mac shortcuts work on a linux system (they\\'re kinda sorta in the same *nix universe )? like theseus in brackets?  has neat benchmarking stuff @recodeexistance testing what you created (i.e., benchmarking, performance.. execution, blah..blah) is not a bad thing, that\\'s good. @quincylarson , i saw the new blog (medium) link/email... is fcc still going to continue the site specific one? (i.e., on the site itself)? @shifthawke you\\'re doing some blogging? nice. i\\'m not sure i could be interesting enough, to blog on a regular basis @flailgull did you fork camperbot? lol but do you have to blog on a consistent basis? what about people that got cobol tattoos  if anything, it would be a perl one lol @earthtone0ne nice, be bold: pascal with lots of dragons and stuff is a clear winner everybody feels that way (not just limited to programming/design) agree. it\\'s so easy to let *you* talk you out of something (endeavor, etc.,) we really are, are own worst critics. great i sound like anthony robbins  lol ^ two posts before that is like aliens i\\'m guessing that the question is because \\'entitled\\' in attitude is sort of incongruent with impostor syndrome (that is to say you\\'d have to have a certain amount of mental maturity to doubt yourself in the first place)  by the way.... i read an article that places \\'natural language\\' skills ahead of mathematics in terms of what may makes a good programmer, a good programmer... thought it was interesting don\\'t know anything (relative to any stream in progress) but, i\\'ve experienced (as a viewer) a lot of buffering/drops in twitch welcome @kastentx  what\\'s the obs (software) experience like on twitch? (if used) @lifeburner looks like there\\'s 3rd party tools/approaches to download streams for twitch (haven\\'t used any of (those)...for local playback my *guess* would be: no.... typically, it\\'s kind of analogous to wget can\\'t recommend without using (in the case of twitch)... but there\\'s a lot of google stuff @rodri0315 the recursion (attempted) just calls itself until you have  maximum call stack exceeded correct me if i\\'m wrong @storbeck but @mindfulbell this part: \\'settimeout(function(title, snippet)\\' is important to the scoping \\'function(title, snippet) within settimeout yes, welcome @sabahang  if you look at some of the twitch blogs, the dropping stream isn\\'t isolated  what was the topic (section) of your stream, @akiralaine ? nice i\\'d watch that (if i could lol) but, that\\'s the same problem i\\'ve had with all twitch streams yeah, the \\'live\\' aspect isn\\'t a deal breaker (in fact video editing imo makes for a more streamlined production) @akiralaine  nice... welcome, @neliusknight  so, @coltonehrman keep seeing the same link scrolling by... can you provide some context to the link(s)? hey, i want a js conference badge you can forget stuff that you did over and over though...  if it was long ago that\\'s actual eye twitching (rem sleep) 250,000 oh, wait... it\\'s \\'how would you go about solving this?\\' doh it was just a guess (i didn\\'t use the coveted problem solving pattern technique) @rodri0315 that will fry the stack golf balls are cool that would be my answer programming is awesome no doubt... but don\\'t idealize it (i.e., barrels of money, total and complete happiness, etc.) -- it begins to sound like a trucking school commercial  lol do the waypoints you will get a ton of javascript (good stuff) i totally underestimated js oh, no i\\'m among designers lol i was wondering what that weird feeling was totally, (although it\\'s hard to argue against the neat stuff i see in scss) have seen some interesting demos that don\\'t even have any js... what\\'s that thing growing out of his neck? nvm lol first rule in motivational speechs: never have eels growing out of your neck (it distracts from point/message) i\\'m afraid i\\'ll turn to stone with medusa neck what\\'s the genesis (meme wise) of this motivational thing? (<--- has no issues with medusa... or serpent challenged people) no, not phil collins i never understood phil collins  i can admit that peter gabriel\\'s music wasn\\'t bad..... in comparison..... (when the universe is defined as late 80s contemporary) not my fav genre  all of the research that went into the realization of the internet... and i\\'m talking about phil collins yep lol you\\'re reading the phil collins bio i know doing a search within pen returns results, but there\\'s no mechanism to access the articles hiya @antoniohoyen  wow, look at @abhisekp \\'s current brownie count thanks @abhisekp  ah, better lol no, i added an extra brownie point to get rid of that \\'palindrome\\' :smile:  nice @mindfulbell , the return results now have links now put some gigantic cats with lightening coming out of their eyes... and you\\'re all set i see where you applied @hermanfassett \\'s, suggested, change (beginning on line 77) looks good you might want to add more context to the overall project (also, see the other forum posts) with lightening and stuff is the project (website) the same as what\\'s in github? (i.e., there\\'s one with a similar name) i like the intro.js that\\'s neat.... is that what was used in one of the prior fcc iterations? you could even add a polling feature to rank the results @allanarmstrong = team treehouse shill lol that\\'s always nice honestly though, there\\'s a cra* load of free resources here (and \\'out there\\') a lot of mobile apps use that model... (but if your free app is so limited that it sucks, i\\'m not even getting to the paid version) the timing of their java offering threw me as well... (i was like, now? weird) yep not if you\\'re referencing an external font... but i think user agent does pair with what\\'s on machine in the latter fonts are pretty so is mine a lot of programs (including browsers) reference what\\'s on the machine itself in terms of fonts (again, when you\\'re not referencing an external (like google) font) english but how do you know about jquery and json, then? welcome @usernamewastaken  @usernamewastaken the curriculum is challenging, and the community is great @usernamewastaken , i\\'d say that (while there are many) this (community) is what sets fcc apart voice commands on mobile text to speech can return really unexpected results try saying gitter to your phone  see what get you that\\'s what those paid bootcamps do. i agree that it\\'s not likely to be able pickup knowlege like that hiya @jelena212  i somtimes feel the same way hi @nprayder  i dont like the popups it would be neat to taper the \\'way to go aspects\\' as you progress visual studio is microsoft though nice. there\\'s also an extension for brackets that does the same sublime is fast (i\\'ll give it that) but i\\'m not sure i like it i think brackets will be a keeper (been evaluating it for a while) yeah that\\'s pretty cool. there\\'s also a node package that does the same preview. haven\\'t installed it yet java slow why not stay in law school and learn to code. you could do patent law for tech industries  you might want to review scoping. global variables can (yes it\\'s contextual) complicate things gitter in mobile so fun hiya @asc1783  what i love is there\\'s standardization (ecma) but variance by browser scripting engine.  noooo lol i\\'m making s new browser called  rupecht (my new browser) js engine will be eye patch but there was a show called sha na na bowser was the lead character.  if use that in place of browser there might be copyright infrig thats what iheart radio thought with pre 1970s sings songs i\\'m on mobile your plan needs work beyond on screen keys lol https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jon_bauman that would be the fly in ointment to your otherwise stellar plan the errant \"z\" will make no difference. lol ok only if you want to make the sha na na singer a dominant force ((google, apple, ha) in tech did test actually pass? (or was/is there output indicating otherwise?) that\\'s really a java platform with new js  sprinkled (recently) over. probably won\\'t get a lot if feedback netbeans rhat is grrr mobile. rhat = that welcome @andrii-skliar  what i wouldn\\'t give for decent text-to-speech (versus mediocre) for basic testing,  i have found running node on a file (or interactively) to be great good success story. i like the hard work and dedication aspect (which i think is sometimes missed) @codenonprofit is fcc going to retain blog or is everything transitioning to medium? (or both) heya @yoga30696  quara has a lot of neat fcc related questions/answers he gives pretty thoughtful answers there (and on blogs) that\\'s a neat level of accesability that (account) aspect is a pain no doubt. (have to agree gitter mobile sucks ok i feel better camperbot may be soulless but the jury is still out on sentient  i see a lot of string conversion with regard to formatting of dates i feel like i\\'m being followed by arrays (bonfire side effect) i\\'m going to use that with meetings @phajava (i\\'m here but my mind may not be) caffeine (if delivered via tasty coffee) rules yeah just any related links  coffee is love camperbot is not bad in comparison to twitch yeah but that\\'s relative. overly advanced stuff could be discouraging  gitter lag i login and get dance party i\\'m dance challenged (to put it mildly ) lol @ayzeeba codecademy\\'s basic js course isn\\'t that great (in fact, many here have done it too (it used to be part of curriculum before homegrown stuff ) js is misunderstood (imo) and is more powerful than it lets on. (this is what i\\'m finding) it kind of borrowed everybody\\'s clothing i think that has more to do with transition dynamics for course intro @ayzeeba you will get plenty o plenty barebones js here  anybody having any issues with \\'dead functionality\\' on chat link in fcc homepage nav?  what\\'s your question @thec0mposer ? you can perform a join in select (and other types, but let\\'s do this for now) on other column names (from other tables) without knowing keys etc. (this helps; however, pk/fk relates to entity relationships ( e.g., you couldn\\'t add transmission data to a table unless there was a parent car record in another... hope that makes sense) @thec0mposer you may want to review (inner) joins http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp\\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3536283/how-to-join-two-tables-mysql @nightvinyl (imo (and i\\'m not an expert), i would say that javascript is very important (even beyond the curriculum) ) @lhm0700 make sure to close quotes help formatting is that the correct id name (based on the instructions)? my (implicit) point was to read the instructions carefully (as the the id name might be different) wait, a minute... wasn\\'t the \\'dark smurf\\' smurfette? lol  yeah, i\\'m reaching back in my memory > 20 years but smurfette was created by some evil wizard so    he could capture the smurfs welcome @saatishq  ^ so, true gitter fcc (...) is worse than nicotine: it should come with a label bottom section relates to repo activity  (fcc itself is a project) noooo @saintpeter lol btw i read your quara quora  grrrr i can spell, i promise i\\'ve seen some pretty neat implementations (various pen examples) of using geo, then ip for fallback i totally guessed you would, @kimkwanka  @kimkwanka , because this isn\\'t your first rodeo (your code examples are neat) you can also run node on yourfile.js (my favorite) i am but just switched to mobile  what\\'s q? trying to add fk yes? i love that you\\'re learning relational db i\\'ve always wondered (yes, those examples are correct for op) why an outer div with col-xs-4 is not applied to the inner elements  http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html take off button before period  .someclass { }; nvm i missed the question at the bottom yes, never eat potted meat @96street are you running this in an exercise or independently? (if so, you will need to reference bootstrap -the latter) help formatting learn regex @jonnps : it rocks wow gitter mobile is doing weird stuff with code formatting  gigantica font are you testing with various target devices grid systems are evil or semi-evil no i say that in (semi) jest @96street  there are still websites out there that are completely un-responsive.... i\\'m like sheesh, get with it  but that\\'s the whole point (i guess really) it\\'s harder and harder to develop solely for desktop... (why would that be your aim.... unless it\\'s some sort of complicated saas app)? pretty broad question... what are your end-goals for learning? howdy @hbourlan  @renatobispo , you benefit from diversifying your learning materials (and it\\'s implicit in approach in course) yeah, i started with codecademy long before fcc.... i wish fcc was around then codecademy has some good stuff; however, some of their material has a lot of logic gaps or appears to written by a team of contributors that never actually talked to each other  which reminds me i have to finish their (codecademy) angular course lol which courses, @mahfouzer ? yeah, their (codecademy) basic js is pretty bad you\\'re being kind @iheartkode lol hiya @neuralneurosis  rock on, @kylebiancardi ! @mahfouzer do the fcc js courses have you mastered js, @mahfouzer ? yeah, i\\'m tempted to learn ruby so, do the fcc javascript stuff (it will get you closer) @mahfouzer .... (i\\'m not bs\\'ng you) @iheartkode when i complete (this) i\\'m probably going to check out ruby (after perl lol) lol well, i do love linux @teejayparker barfing while coding is bad formula yes, it\\'s called bwitterlisp @kimkwanka  inkscape rocks (not just for svg) lol  you can do all kinds of layout in inkscape draw svg over bitmaps, (bunch of other stuff... i use it even for non-web applications... (there are terminal commands etc., exports in a lot of formats) it\\'s bada^^ sounds like fried pork skins @iheartkode have you worked with dynamic svg (drawing) ? (i\\'ve seen references, looks kind of interesting) kind of in a canvas context yeah, constructors suck lol do you limit the number of chars in your quote string, @osterbergmarcus ? @osterbergmarcus what are you trying to escape in your regex (where you\\'re concatenating url with....) ? @osterbergmarcus try: qtext.replace(/\\\\s%20/g,\\' \\')\\'\"); @kimkwanka being down to your last cig is good and bad (mostly bad... ) when you wake... you\\'re going to be like...\"wtf is my cig (in this case \\'where\\') lol @qmikew1 no it\\'s not lol @osterbergmarcus the pen is timing out on me.. but i think the issue is you\\'re not passing the concatenated value.... you\\'re passing the literal replace regex statement (wrong) ... does that make sense? bye @kimkwanka  #i am font, bwah ha, ha there you go but it\\'s \\'1/2 tag\\'  like i thought you would enclose the hash(s) no, it only accommodates \\'gitter markup\\' ramen is flavored with things too not sure if they\\'re organic in all cases your takeover of the universe has some holes it\\'s telling you to use brackets @iheartkode then you know why atom is at a loss for words  lol cue lightsaber sound nvm cue lightsaber sound again, (php @iheartkode ) lol did i just see an eggplant  i really want eggplant now, t h a nks  ah mobile again gitter mobile you must really want to learn angular  a for effort have you considered codescool , codecademy again i am on mobile grammar police camperbot is time-zone free if you don\\'t love (or finding yourself loving) to problem solve, coding may not be nirvana for some (that may be what op is kind of getting at idk) help formatting the best (or a) way is to paste your code and describe issue that you\\'re experiencing (you multiply your chances of getting help) i\\'m pretty sure i woke up this am, because i wanted coffee sad or you could paste your code not you @alayek  the  actual code that is not passing, (this was the point of help formatting invocation) this way it\\'s easier for folks to troubleshoot issues / help people camperbot is love (turns head) yes, it does things based on regex and direct commands etc.,  hiya @ignorantusguru  welcome hiya @dukeyu2011 , @samanehg  not bad, waking up slowly @khurramn was your question answered? welcome @viktorzo  focus on the coding part, first. (start with the exercises) @ignorantusguru  coffee woke me up like from slumber are you talking about environment paths? i ask because, i recall someone having an issue running both a 32bit and 64bit version(s) probably not applicable nvm more coffee, that is the answer for everything i was just going through nginx docs you\\'re totally right about heroku lol the documentation is not \\'hand holding\\' by any measure @prashcr are you running a server from your own hardware? (or deployed on something like aws) welcome @pavanp73  hi @galz28  @akiralaine are you going to take another try at twitch? not a good time to do bonfire, check lol got it. i usually work through invoking node on a local js file (so, my procrastination excuse isn\\'t very good) hiya @kofiakorli  imo you should approach it sequentially (go through all the js based bf) before taking on angular @benmcmahon100 is 2.0 going to break stuff? there are some days i wish i used a blackberry again lol it provides coherent insight (of course not every possible approach ) to dev  there\\'s also a community dynamic that sets this (fcc) apart... great community and there is an inclusiveness that seems to be communicated in the project itself. so, to me there\\'s kind of a stakeholder feeling (not sure how to articulate this) that comes accross now i have the entire album rotating in head weird you should mention floyd, watched a documentary the other day  i think there was a restart on the site about an hour ago (could be side effect idk) yeah, refresh should do it oh, i totally didn\\'t get that medium actually integrates into site itself.  hi @g2musicgroup  cats are the internet overlords bot tax mobile and sticking to monosyllabic responses  where\\'s the pen (can give a mobile responsive perspective (if anything while on mobile)) i wonder if apple purposely messes with chrome.  good assumption, same here weather forecast totally off 70s my... there\\'s this weird lag (device independent) in gitter that i can\\'t put my finger (on) linux/chrome when not on mobile chromium that is subtle ie sucks on so many levels that definitely a motivator: the average consumer (be it content, apps, etc.) has very little patience for non-performant stuff that\\'s welcome @aanjan91  no (and unrelated, there\\'s a refresh issue on the mobile side) wow, interesting scroll. i agree with darksmurf  heya nice. @darksmurf  so, you can use (those) offline i\\'ve gone over this before... the \\'dark smurf\\' is smurfette. wikipedia: * she was created by gargamel, the smurfs\\' enemy, in order to distract and trap them; however, later she was rescued by papa smurf and turned into a real smurf. *  lol sudo rm / sudo rm / -r lol it\\'s a beer from colarado  (so they say) while, indeed cra***, i\\'ve never seen such a strong opinion about it you\\'re interfering with \\'basking in the timestamp\\' functionality @abhisekp   lol looks good @dsenza (and it also, looks like you\\'ve handled string len as well) does codepen add extra stuff hiya @rusty4077  hell world i am ruphrect. i wanting to learn code so i can on day hv own avacado tree oh like that hello world welcome @rockie667  i can\\'t remember, but i\\'m pretty sure that i came up with some variant of \\'h e ll o world\\' because i felt sort of silly (so we all have the feeling.... welcome!) your argument needs to be a string lol i think i first saw fcc on a lifehaker feedly lifehacker yeah i think there\\'s a date joined in homepage  you could pair that with the archives (am i getting this right)?  a lot were pruned (i think) due to lack of activity there should be a dimension guideline for camperbot\\'s wiki invocation... i was wondering the same, he really knows his stuff once you visit the room (help with bonfires etc., etc.) you\\'ll have it in \\'favs\\' (side panel) for easy reference/access but there\\'s also the contextual (which isn\\'t working for me all of the sudden) feature if you\\'re in a bonfire and click chat it will take you to the relevant room use mdn why? @canemunster (it might be good to provide feedback) mine was delivered to me via feedly i was like nice... gotta check this out welcome @jamaldt  lord vader? so, not lord vader? drats lol @dillonklein that bigger + button throws off the uniform row thing in the grid the only thing i could  come up with is (will paste in a second... but you may want to get other input.....)\\n ```\\n.btnplus{\\n  height:80px;\\n margin-bottom:-50px;\\n}\\n``` <---waits for the onslaught of responsiveness criticism  camperbot it will be ok, they love you (really) i\\'m sure camperbot at the end of the day says \"those ungrateful bas****\" lol @abhisekp has an invocation re: animated gifs explain gifs nope that\\'s not it omg what did you do lol any character from back to the future is like a religious level of being what\\'s next, will you graffiti the delorean lol  i think the telepathic nature is somewhat watered down with text firefox should be leading the chant (yes chrome is faster but,) so they just left the comment? oh, that\\'s fun to trace yeah, like remap \\'what values\"? might be nice but that would be too easy <---thinks initnotification may effect @arielleslie \\'s normal patient responses  affect grrr gitter is it too much to ask, oh nvm i love how chrome\\'s request desktop view requires a hard reset to undo help formatting those aren\\'t bacticks hi repl.it wow that keeps happening lol so like find within a large string? (multiples) yeah (n) number of palindromes @abhisekp \\'s proposal oh numeric pals it\\'s around 2am -  took me a moment too latr see? late they need to fix their request desktop view functionally  welcome @nalipp  i wonder if an introduction to camperot grrr mobile should be included (in terms of invoking its wiki)  bring back blackberry! ok i feel better repl.it needs to work on their mobile interface i\\'m just here to watch the real time markup if aliens (far across galaxy) code, what is the closest lang that we have that they would use (casio keyboard idea taken already) hmmm you told potential emp that you\\'re not familiar with their setup, right? download ubuntu if you want to familiarize yourself with *nix based approach i\\'m just saying if on your first day you\\'re looking at a mac like a caveman would look at a toaster might leave bad impression.  i feel ya @justinunderhill i\\'m not a mac fan (use linux) it will workout @justinunderhill  it\\'s assumed if you\\'re a dev you know cli  np @justinunderhill. you will figure it out (really, it\\'s just pre-nerves) except you won\\'t be eating watery oatmeal  lol oatmeal juice no clue i want oatmeal now i\\'m at the magic hour (nothing open) where i can go to some distant outpost for oatmeal  good luck @justinunderhill  the mac topic got me thinking. don\\'t let hardware be an impediment to dev aspirations: a lot of linux distros can turn even the oldest hardware into a good rig why not just stick with external editor ? that\\'s really diverse skill set (persian rugs + web dev) welcome @ngonnella  you\\'ll do fine (eye for detail is most applicable to coding) there\\'s also content (in addition to methods) i think marketing people are secure in their jobs with @allanarmstrong  it has a ring though  nook noooo i love auto correct votivevote (adds soft touch ) yeah gitter is not productive you\\'ll find your own productively groove  the best part of the crockford page is the pattern summary at bottom (public/private, etc) another thing to add to list (sign up for pen (while it\\'s still non-pro option(able)) are the main differences pretty much \\'private option\\' & collaboration tools? (pro vs. non) i think you\\'re right about that @storbeck , look at the pens tagged with \\'free code camp\\' you see a lot of pro featured users built-in resources... (sounds better and better) (assets) do you just take a laptop or pad, and login and show prospective clients your work? (i.e., kind of hand device over for a minute)  do both the link idea (to actual pen) is a good idea too it\\'s good to be poached -in the talent sense -- (congratulations)  not in the cooking sense lol it\\'s hard to gauge project scope ( over the lifetime of endeavor) sometimes.  (especially if there isn\\'t a strong project management ethos) totally... as well as scope directive-direction (hey i just made a new word) agreed. i think there is more acceptance of that where the product/service itself is tech related... or in cases where a very large budget is allocated (then, ba is a total must and can\\'t be ignored ) ok, where\\'s the six sigma waypoint? or scrum bonfire lol you would need a backend database sql (mysql, postgresql, sql server) or no-sql (mongodb, or others) don\\'t use access as a web based database json will be in the no-sql category btw there\\'s a mongodb portion of curriculum (although, you\\'ll get different opinions about mongo) as a production asset  i think the scenario sound more like a local project you can grant certain ip address access in *nix (and other systems) unix (linux , bsd,  mac (to a certain degree) it\\'s unix like... is the main idea will do @quincylarson  @takumar yeah, i loved that part.. as well as the cheeto covered desk and the screen saver (the guy from seinfeld in jurassic park) there are at least 4 links in that zipline... which one? oh, nvm  that link lol yep (and looks interesting)  i see how this is going to go now... i finish said section, and more stuff is added.. then i finish said section... lol could functionality (akin to the t-shirt campaign) that has (n) number of items were added to curriculum - click here to hide forever type thing... be added? lay it on us @progmacattack  very nice... but where\\'s the score? worked for me .... it\\'s pretty neat... (only thing is the score i\\'m totally not trying to be nit picky) lots of great logic np  oooh let me try that mode but that gives it character....  remember the old video games? they had all kinds of issues.... i could drive off tracks that didn\\'t exist if you really want to shake it up.... have multiple tic tac boards all going at the same time yeah it\\'s monster tic tac toe (the auto restart is a nice touch) tic-tac-chipotle just seeing camperbot\\'s smile is enough for me i\\'m too caught up in the glow to be insulted lkl or lol as some might say the gitter emotes, don\\'t render consistently for me any longer (weird)\\n\\n\\n where\\'s set1 array coming from? yes, i got that part lol  help formatting i now see why you didn\\'t give set1 array details goat? lol lol @iheartkode  are you accounting for zero based index (s1 starts at 0 (good)) in comparison with length? @iheartkode  i dunno, i\\'d have to agree about re-write  @iheartkode you have 8 items in your array ... if loop is based on < len won\\'t you only get 7 ? starting from 0 based index you\\'re right on @iheartkode suggestion, @groundxaero  (index wise, button threw through me off) \\n grrr ```\\nvar set1 = [\"item1\",\"item2\",\"item3\",\"item4\", \"item5\",\"item6\",\"item7\",\"item8\"];\\n\\nset1pos = 0;\\nfor (i=0; i < set1.length; i++){\\n    //artificial loop to emulate button clicks\\n\\n\\nif (set1pos < set1.length){\\n    console.log (set1[set1pos]);\\n    //do some jquery text \\n    set1pos++;\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\n``` will you be pairing cheese burgers with jd for your selection? sarcasm brownie points are the best yes, knowing camperbot\\'s regex \\'th a n ks\\' triggers is good when you don\\'t want it (camperbot) butting into your comment with \\'if you want to ....th a nk someone\\' do this... select it? chat is context specific... if you open it from map... you get general chat... if you open it from bonfire it opens in bonfire etc.,  (although there were some changes so, don\\'t know now) i don\\'t think it\\'s specific to the exact bonfire... but help with bonfire in general gitter desktop, isn\\'t great (doesn\\'t offer anything over browser based (in fact, it\\'s less featured)) @iheartkode i want to see the project when it\\'s finished lol @solineoz to each her/his own.... i\\'ve run it (gitter desktop)  on linux and found it to be lacking @solineoz i kept wondering \"where\\'s the extra functionality\"? almost makes me wonder if there\\'s a hidden feature set for pro-users (paid gitter teams) @solineoz that\\'s the thing, i don\\'t know... (in desktop it seems pointless,  but there would have to be a reason for it... )  nice... i\\'ll refresh once and a while to check its progress right now @solineoz  still isn\\'t great, so going back to browser based gitter the one thing that i noticed is audio.... raining like crazy here getting to be a pita @storbeck you\\'re going to take the 2.0 plunge? (is it out yet?) lol i still have to finish the codecademy angular course.... (am all over the place in sequential aspects) @toverto  it\\'s three back ticks (left of 1 key on standard keyboard) then shift + enter.. paste in between help formatting hiya @gevurah418  that dog looks like it gets snacks by sheer mind control *you will give me snack now, and these aren\\'t the droids we\\'re looking for* http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter5.html - makes me wonder about error handling (towards bottom of page, throw hey optical mouse(s) still work when soaked in coffee hiya @justinhernandez510  nice @progmacattack i\\'m on mobile but will go back in history when i get on laptop (and take a look) is it uriah heap + van halen? git for codepen lol so, valen better with hagar or roth? vanhalen nice drawing animation (responsive too viewed in mobile) do you have an interface that helps you conceptualize animation in scss roth does rule. (and has a dojo in japan) @storbeck  scss part tweak and go looks good you have a lot of patience twerk? lol @allanarmstrong  you can probably see the values to patterns  i started noticing that too seemed like it happened quickly this is why i\\'ve been procrastinating on codecademy\\' angular. nobody seems to like it. lol is 2 trying to be react? hmmm i\\'m sensing a shift in what i\\'m going to research that part i like (component ) modularity to a wide open language it\\'s almost bringing the desktop software model to the web now the java in your name makes sense lol hajava could be some ancient family name you know if your name was larryc++ it would be easier to detect lol welcome @johnnyjuicebox  it\\'s just referencing it for you. you have to write the magic bootstrap reference enables you to *use bootstrap * it saying the reference was done for you. but now you have to add/use bootstrap stuff yourself (in your divs ) np thanks for calling me out dude (classic) i\\'m so close to going to the dark side (react) there\\'s a third (beyond react and angular) @ageel, fcc references bootstrap for you in the lessons (hence behind the scenes) but you have to reference it in your own page as @storbeck stated (i.e., whatever you\\'re developing outside of the lessons, etc. ) there\\'s real time syntax checking in the fcc editor now i was going to say @abhisekp , it caught a console.log() statement after return...  linter on brackets is really picky can i say that i ignore a lot of it and still be a good person? lol i think it\\'s the strict part too @allanarmstrong it converts stuff to actual errors https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/strict_mode  it will slow down (the progress speed) now you\\'re in \\'thinking muck\\' this is what i love @robwar24 , you want to code? here it is... no general courses unrelated to what you want to do h i n t : different arguments are passed to evaluate your logic is what they mean by compiled (scss) so, what\\'s the \\'compiled\\' option in scss for codepen? ah, nice so, it\\'s not using any extended functionality (per se) but compiles 1:1 to good ole css? that\\'s a relief... because it would be kind of like a java virtual machine if not .... (that would suck) sassy ok, i\\'m seeing where the nested conversation started http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.scss_for_sass_users.html so, there was mention of merging styles into a single file.... how does that work with (at sign)import lol i wonder what it would be like to eat cheetos while sitting in a large server farm (no, that\\'s not an admin job i\\'d like) why because of the temp / humidity control? oh, there\\'s that too @usopn94 it presupposes  that your argument is going to be static (which is counter to this function\\'s purpose) sorry for the sass (lol) but i see a lot of integration with sublime (but i\\'m using brackets i see some there too) is the build system that much of a pita? yeah, i\\'m thinking that too editor wise... for whatever reason this is interesting,  (wading into design territory ) ok, before you take on recursion... know first that a function\\'s arguments aren\\'t static so, it\\'s not just 5.... it\\'s going to evaluate a number of (well,) numbers there is such a thing as static variables though, oh nvm @usopn94 what\\'s the 10 minute interval?  i want to see the weird + button oh it\\'s the stroke button style (as in causing) i can\\'t get twitch to play consistently  is that drop shadow? i do like materialize (especially the <li></li> buttons) somebody had a demo before button converts to list (maybe i\\'m easily impressed) you need to approach it like \\'what would i do (or not do do) with *any number* passed as an argument @usopn94  agreed gitter is a cpu hog yeah, it would be nice to have the channel sans the interface... but your experience says.... looking at the screenshots of hexchat (which looks interesting) it would seem just the announcements (entered room etc.,) alone would overwhelm client @anthonygallina1 try it and tell us what happens lol i\\'m on linux as well nice @iheartkode i think i bookmarked the pen hang on.... yeah, i saw a local reference to .js file @iheartkode  nice, you have two additional sets i still don\\'t get the goat thing lol it rendered for me .... omg i\\'ll never be the same this is why the whole matrix narrative would have never worked: no machine could come up with such a bad site i mean spinning dogs and rainbows? bye @iheartkode  i think he was having trouble getting over the argument hurdle  i don\\'t want to laugh but must lol do, de do lol another palindrome  that\\'s so weird @abhisekp you weren\\'t kidding (i see you added on to the proposal) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palindromic_number yeah yes, they\\'re insidious (subliminal messages) i now want to eat potted meat while coding (no explanation)  i think that has a different ring to it (that one would probably want to avoid in most industries) lol one bad (yeah, just that) about being assimilated by the borg, is there doesn\\'t seem to be an actual collective approach (i mean how many said, \"cube design bad.... let\\'s change it\" only to be shamed) hmm what \"looks good\" is entirely subjective in some cases there\\'s more emotional risk with design @kimkwanka that part i don\\'t like (homogeneous elements in webpages) so much  it\\'s like this (to me anyway) you have some (ultimately) visual element and somebody says \"that sucks, or is ugly\" that\\'s more emotionally damaging than \"your code sucks\" because one can subjectively make the code better (i tend towards coding btw)  @kimkwanka totally. @sangsatori understand what you\\'re saying (from the other end of spectrum) @elcortez there\\'s stuff actively going on with keystrokes (linter etc.,) when you\\'re doing exercise etc.,-- is there a specific issue that you\\'re running into? https://repl.it/languages --online... but, locally is my favorite (invoking node on local .js file) wait, what\\'s wrong with linkedin ? (broadly speaking) that is creepy @allanarmstrong  but linkedin has a business like quality to it (i see employers referencing it (that could also be the creepy factor that @allanarmstrong is talking about)) lol @allanarmstrong you didn\\'t sign-up for the super,super pro package even better than just pro how is a site about forklifts going to help lol i want an exoskeleton \"forklift\" like the one in aliens.   heya @petey9891  @sangsatori, my guess is figure out what you\\'re most inclined towards and concentrate on that (doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t (or don\\'t) learn the full spectrum of things) @lifeburner camperbot *is* sentient it\\'s just taking notes so that it can commandeer your toaster   @kathy-volpe maybe a dev job that\\'s hr centric could be your entry point agent or principal? (of cthulu) i would edit for spelling , but... it\\'s a weekday and all @nweat sometimes a survey isn\\'t as enlightening as experiencing it for yourself welcome @swrogers  `this` could be like this: `1*2*3` @shawhiz welcome.... (although, it\\'s not hell) lol @nweat i suppose i was answering it in the context of your original post (not trying to be contentious or anything) it had a competing e-learning vibe to it @sundiata2 welcome :smile:  i\\'m trying to make myself use more emotes i hate emotes but.... wait, there\\'s no \\'but\\' the hamster with the fedora makes it so much better i mean life without a hamster in a fedora would be so boring well, it could be early 90s madonna (which would add a whole new level of weirdness) you may need to switch \\'modes\\' (right hand side there\\'s convo icon - and keyboard icon (compose)) manually. after you paste your code etc., the icon will be \"keyboard\"... try changing that (back to chat mode) and then press enter (this is after you\\'ve followed all of the formatting requirements etc.) hmmm ... if it works for you, go with it.  gitter has some quirks, no doubt. big whiteboard is a great tool hello, i am igor... i am wanting to learn lisp for making great idea yeah, totally @shifthawke .. it sucks ok back, how much \\'quality discussion\\' did i miss? lol oh, you\\'re all talking about sudoku great about as much as knitting @dwd2010  ok, no i don\\'t like knitting it\\'s a comparison to things that i would likely not do (knitting, sudoku) hi @ccallen001  yes, be productive and go to the waypoints.... (escape the chat while you can!) welcome @jongoesboom  sounds like a good interview question \"suppose stack overflow is down, what do you do\"? heya @phajava  it\\'s more geared towards \"what do you do if you can\\'t look something up\"? lol i saw all the \"oh, cr*p so is down\" posts and it just made me chuckle  @iheartkode on mobile your avatar looks like e.t.\\'s lighted finger (et phone home) @jbmartinez where did you go? (good to see you) hate is a strong word. i don\\'t hate emotes, i loathe them lol gitter mobile renders things so weird btw hope you feel better @shifthawke  you and @jbmartinez are making me all sappy noooo brackets alrighty then same here mobile too limited the infinity shakespeare thing was wrong  lol no? you\\'re so wrong omg not wordpress true, but i think if you get too much into wordpress you\\'re in for more wordpress.... (i.e.,. limiting yourself to that) agreed, @storbeck , @allanarmstrong  @thedigitalmonk do you have an incentive plan? @thedigitalmonk i know how opensource works, thanks. people can be shills for anything i suppose yeah, totally that\\'s a vulcan  are the goats gone from your app now @iheartkode (yes, contained in the array) lol node.js rock on the issue is you\\'re conflating php with worpress.... the former can live without the latter  larva? welcome @jigglyduff  yeah, it\\'s very similar to os comparisons  well, @muzza96 you\\'re certainly an honest person lol wrong this is good this doesn\\'t involve selling water purifiers or soap does it @ashroulston ? heyyyyy what did you do the the links @shifthawke ? lol  hi @cryptoedge  @shifthawke it\\'s like this: [casual room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/casual) grrrrr wtf ok, better.... the gitter markup, if there\\'s a space it won\\'t work oh, we\\'ve found camperbot yeah, i\\'ve thought the same nooo slurred type i saw when @abhisekp got his 666 th brownie 657 is the mark of the beast now? lol, yeah he should be @shifthawke what about page 999 hi @bayasglan  when /collapse doesn\\'t work part a oh, it\\'s just for that? that sucks there should be an option for (collapsing) formatted code too i wonder if there are any health risks associated with ascii versions of emotes gigantic robots camperbot feasts on squirrels i\\'m convinced  they drop their acorns and run like he^^ when camperbot walks by that kind of looks like the old icon for the cassette tape (ancient recording medium) @shifthawke  oh, that\\'s totally better even the best app people will begin to find fault with depends on market  an still be eating ramen and f that lol what kind of issue are you experiencing @effriam  did you refresh? hang on... a second @effriam what\\'s the waypoint # associated? ok, @effriam  didn\\'t notice any issue with the waypoint when i accessed it wow i switch to mobile and look what happens jobs in general are like that. sometimes the candidate they really wanted flaked. and so you get the call if there are no skills listed assume you\\'re going to be walking on a stage and move on. lol it\\'s optional some people pair program oh, i thought they were being vague on the type of skills mobile sucks i need a bluetooth keyboard for mobile i tried voice but kept getting errant expletives in translation oh i want my blackberry now i\\'m sad.  i know your secret love for all things research in motion that\\'s right omg he was f ng with you  yeah bad plan this has happened to me in other contexts snl you sleep, where\\'s the question mark non relational and generally json i\\'m not a big fan of no sql but it\\'s good for a lot of things it\\'s all context i look away for 2 seconds if you\\'re not fond of the data go with mongo and then there\\'s mcdonald\\'s the notifications will drive you mad yeah i\\'m wondering the same thing wow puts ice scraper/brush back it would be neat to make a patio weather station app eloquent js is a good read and any crockford video  np now i know why that screen name creates dissonance: andy kaufman had a character called nick ferrari. lol pumpkin spice is magic it\\'s the (pumpkin) spice that make things good: pumpkin, itself, is pretty much tasteless mush meh never too late see? now don\\'t you have an overwhelming sense of satisfaction? yes, you now understand the power of \\'the camperbot\\' lol welcome @jonc12450  github? about @jonc12450  try clicking the login with github button  or what @arielleslie has ^ welcome @tommydnt  ```\\n<!-- i\\'m commented -->\\n\\ni\\'m not commented\\n\\n<!-- i\\'m commented here,\\nas well as here.\\n-->\\n\\nremove (<!-- && -->)\\nand i\\'ll go back to being \\nun-commented\\n\\n<!-- i could be some line of html that\\ni want to disable for testing without \\naffecting other stuff, or just to comment\\nabout stuff that i\\'m doing -->\\n``` commenting code (actual js (and insert language here)... is really important to sanity of yourself (and more so of others) oh no @jbmartinez is getting close to \\'the number\\' the power of javascript compels you  hama kyā bhāṣā mēṁ bāta kara rahē haiṁ?

that\\'s tight @kimkwanka  @jbmartinez help two more people he\\'s 2 away from 666 brownies i totally want to see the pea soup typing @jbmartinez have you suddenly been speaking in (classical) latin? retro-look is neat, (should be in a magazine ad from the 50s) nooo not that part that ^ i have to show great restraint in my ziplines which i\\'ll get to pretty shortly..... (i.e., i\\'m on the fence about giant cats with laser eyes) what exists only in the states? i\\'m totally not into gaming (although i can\\'t really be high-and-mighty and all: gitter is a total productivity sucker) it\\'s that camperbot that pulls you in sup yes, i do @thec0mposer  if you mean terminal (linux user here) go ahead you\\'re doing this in bash, right? (i.e., not trying it as a one liner) hmmm are you using this in conjunction with grep? try prepending with this: 2>&1 you\\'re setting up \\'environment\\' for what you echoed i believe try typing env in terminal (the one you have open) ok, m.u.u... can you type env @thec0mposer  lol or m.o.t.u \\'master of the universe\\' yeah it\\'s badass you have some skills oh tax collector one what\\'s the broader exercise? like why  or \\'what\\' are you ultimately trying to do ? if you\\'re writing a script in bash there\\'s a header at the top of your .sh file that looks (although different in some cases) like this: #! /bin/bash you can paste (i think \\\\n is retained) a column into terminal  but i don\\'t think you can chain those but why, i\\'ve never used treehouse, wtf are they teaching you lol like what\\'s the context/end goal of the exercise oh, yes vista i owe my linux knowledge to vista had a borked recovery image or something.... and bought a linux disk/magazine.. i might check out that treehouse, exercise you\\'re doing... i like (at least) the direction that they\\'re going about @jbmartinez  oh, yeah so, close yeah, i saw that a week or two before... he was asking questions/ getting feedback etc. (i think this is same thing) yeah, looks like he\\'s done some work to it in the last week nan it\\'s great! @davidh250  you\\'ll learn lots of javascript (and other stuff) depends oh, ok go ahead hang on @thec0mposer  do you mean like the inverse of running env in terminal (where you see a whole list etc.) you want to specify \\'which\\' or point it to? still there @thec0mposer  when you type env in terminal... are you seeing what you originally exported? you\\'re not actually doing this in terminal? ok, good item to include lol hold on i need some coffee let\\'s do this realtime with terminal open brb so, you have terminal open? @thec0mposer  hmmm this is good overated about @jbmartinez  grr thanks @jbmartinez  ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! split pea soup time now you must levitate and speak in languages you\\'ve never heard (not computer languages, because i know you love even the most obscure) interesting @jurgenzz , but the entire house is the hover object (it\\'s intuitive at least for me to click a section/or panel of the house) the house itself doesn\\'t hover  like some people with 666 brownie points it looks neat i like it batperson there was a show called ultraman i think you should show heat escaping from the house (with that demonstration) to show how much money you lose without proper insulation (or you could have giant iguanas escaping) wow, a lot of stuff on that subreddit @quincylarson seems like there\\'s a marked urgency (or confluence) of exposure (medium, reddit (redux) quora, etc.,) must be exciting   i think that ms\\' historical approach to things has been proven untenable going, forward.... they\\'re making inroads to opensource because they have to @lifeburner setting that up through wine is kind of a mess relative in what context ? ( high volume licenses for os, or framework type stuff) howdy @dwitjes89  ok, i\\'m going back to the 90s in my mind (i\\'ve been on the other side of this argument (i think) btw) i\\'m imagining listening to a lot of self loathing generational music on my journey back to the 90s and the perspective of business climate with reference to ms  you mean r.e.m?  i think emo was some sort of muppet @quincylarson i believe that (it comes through in a lot of different ways) seriously heya @aoxom  hey, the functioning works... only a couple of things... there\\'s an alignment issue with the buttons (and the only other thing kind of nit picky i know.... is when you press clear (it clears) but most calcs go back to 0 when cleared) yeah, i think your 0 button is skewing and the plus now it\\'s cold again it sucks yeah, that was pretty epic fail @davidh250  t thx @shifthawke  doesn\\'t let you post i would imagine  i think the specs were marking completed you could use a simple backend db i wasn\\'t talking about codepen like politics sounds good i love \\'the bobs\\' from office space so, true that it\\'s funny (is why it\\'s funny) \\'consultants\\' now i\\'m thinking about office space scenes. great. t h a n ks lol i don\\'t want to invoke \\'the bot\\' with regex which is worse, michael bolten or milton i think flochart has something to do with a late 70s show called diner i was so in the middle of talking about shell stuff, but then convo went south earlier... so, now it\\'s all office space all the time lol shell as in the layer between you and your os for executing commands maybe because c is strict \\'er\\' you\\'re talking about algorithms javascript (via node) is not known for its typing   i was following @terakilobyte \\'s node to c calling.... (and was thinking is it because, c has typing that\\'s strict vs. javascript (which is not known for typing) with all the heavy algorithm stuff) make sense @lifeburner  ? oh, i see what you\\'re saying oh, great now i\\'m off into serious thread mgmt reading pthread (am i on the right track?) i don\\'t (linux is my primary os) well, i guess  pthreads-w32 might quench your thirst for fire there so, if i ever finish codecademy\\'s angular... then i\\'ll pretty much be forced to do react am i learning beta-max with current iteration of angular?  well? angular suck or no suck (as in does it suck) but it\\'s going to change (fundamentally it sounds like) but that\\'s the opposite of  the whole paradigm @storbeck yeah there\\'s a good representation (here) of folks on both sides of that this is the thing.... if you\\'ve been doing something (and we have all of our favorite langs/databases/ what have you) for awhile.... then you have a strong opinion, i just feel like coming into javascript modularity as a noob angular has an uncertain feel (as a snapshot in time) to it.  finish the angular course and shut up (this is my advice to myself) lol good point (we aren\\'t limited to one or the other) @terakilobyte  i\\'m watching a video about algebra on a friday night. wtf is wrong with me what kind of stylus + software is he using to write out stuff? that\\'s wicked cool (i could use that) when a white-board type concept is needed during a screencast what\\'s a boston (besides a city)? do i have to buy some special sort of (for said leaking boston)? i have never heard that term oh, i get it whew really, is that a boston thing? saying \"wicked\" a lot? that could be bad, (i.e., sitting in stands of opposing team) and be mis-identified as a boston fan because i say \\'wicked\\' a lot.... i\\'m giving you brownies for warning me lol thanks @storbeck  i think what you\\'re saying is our education system sucks  yeah, it\\'s hard to argue against that ^ i\\'m way beyond that there are 29 nations ranking ahead of us (those of us in \\'us\\') in math... seriously, common core? no we actually suck admitting that you suck, is the first step in not sucking same here that\\'s a lot on the language plate japanese is difficult watching anime and learning japanese is not the same thing (it\\'s like saying star trek is a klingon learning language exercise) sigh lol nihongo ga desk ka? desk = desu f ng auto correct it\\'s been about 20 years since i studied japanese (and trust me i don\\'t get a lot of language reinforcement in these neck of the woods).... so, give me break lol muffins are cool pumpkin ones with cream cheese so portable  i don\\'t know your muffin reference lowes sells hammers and particle board and keychains that say \"not for climbing \" like i\\'d entrust my life to a trinket from home depot or lowes hey, i\\'m going mountain climbing i got this here, keychain what could go wrong? is that david bowie different colored eyes muffin you don\\'t need to spend a lot of money.... there\\'s so much out there in terms of learning resources (i.e., all kinds of free sh^^ to learn just about anything) i still want to know, the stylus+app setup that was used on that learning tree video i\\'m on east coast too music bugs me (when coding)  i saw activity related to that old link @jbmartinez .... weird it\\'s still there hexchat i might try (based in suggestions) on please don\\'t be the lady at dollar general that\\'s a case where the actual expletive would have been better @saintpeter  lol ok segue  horsepower to weight ratio camperbot only seeks to be understood yes camperbot i will obey only camperbot  i just realized that the birds are braces a week ago lane splitting is fun until grandma two cars ahead decides to open door the there\\'s the opposite, i think it dangerous to be in center of lane when stopped at a light.  i\\'m on mobile. contractions all messed up welcome @hellokai  and @perrywortman  i\\'m on mobile but is that a guitar ? nice (the avatars shrink down) i have used the desktop version on linux. it sucks sucks in the sense that it offers no features found in browser version not found that is i wanted it to work (desktop apps are sometimes better yes heresy ) but gitter doesn\\'t do it  try opening a browser instance and desktop instance at the same time. and compare (switch back and forth to test feature set) ten key pad bindings  @abunadhrah  you may want to paste your code help formatting explain format  i need coffee and laptop  three back ticks then ctrl + shift paste code in between like a sandwich  help format  wtf slowly being caffeinated  evilfunction lol the mobile gitter sucks (yes, i say this over and over) but it has a list of suggested rooms (i had no idea that there was a node room (this is the broader gitter)) yeah, but isn\\'t there a cap on number of users? (i.e., have to go pro) there\\'s a good vibe going community wise... it\\'s unique i don\\'t use fb yeah stack overflow can be totally hostile (imo) or sort of snooty  not that i don\\'t use so, but you\\'re right. they seem to get stuck on process, and not helping yeah, i can see the overall logic about it but still me either @lisandroalves that\\'s true cats are the answer to everything careful, @kimkwanka  you\\'re so close to the perfect calculator .... (it will takeover your life, and you\\'ll be muttering to yourself \"what if it does this? what if it could do that?\") that\\'s classic typing style (i.e., top row lateral layout) ...i\\'ve never really used that (always been numpad) you need to use giant cats @shifthawke  i have... there were netbooks that didn\\'t have numpad (so yes, i\\'d use) but you can always plug a usb numbpad into those (which i did) some of the early asus netbooks did not have numpad yes, targus has a usb numpad @alexdclark which waypoint is this? @alexdclark paste your code (please).... it might be the sizing in the class  declaration itself is off yeah, typos get all of us numpad is a deal breaker for me gotta have it welcome @amrinder211  @amrinder211 post your question,  folks here will help great, what\\'s the question? start here: http://www.freecodecamp.com/map the tracing thing looks really neat *because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it* another nudge towards react grrr i\\'m having windows xp flashbacks  @evaristoc how\\'s the progress on results of (data science stuff) that you were going to publish? we do have hoverboards: http://www.lexus-int.com/amazinginmotion/slide/ but it\\'s chicken or egg.... is this because of the movie or despite it? nice @evaristoc ... this is a little different than the training aspect for sample. there were some interesting aspects about other areas of analysis (e.g., what other qualitative things) you could gain from beginning -ending stuff that\\'s the problem....  sample size too small true how so? (because you can prep stuff with scripting) i think one of the requirements was js (i recall a repo that somebody had done that \\'js afied\\' some bash based stuff) the potato is a marvelous wonder @evaristoc agreed. i\\'m just thinking patterns yet to be discovered (total \\'down the rabbit hole\\' thing...) @evaristoc nah, good stuff. keep plugging along @evaristoc i will think about this.  not like tomorrow or anything bye @evaristoc  don\\'t eat carrot cake with cream cheese on an empty stomach hey hey i would say hey but i think there\\'s a limit welcome new people oh sure you get a hey back if you\\'re @kimkwanka lol   i have to go to dollar general to be called doll what\\'s up with that? stop at a month or less you need to really learn the concepts. especially in the bay area because you\\'re going to have a lot of competition the point of feedback is to get well feedback positive or negative you are running a brownie deficit  soon you will have to have wheelbarrows of brownies to get the same value lol what\\'s that? this thing: ```>:)``` looks like a cute sparrow (far from evil looking) yeah, no... still cute that looks like a muppet don\\'t know about php aspect; however, you can setup an email server on linux (pita, and not a lite topic if you\\'re just messing with stuff for experimentation) (locally that is) me too sardine ice cream rules full sardine (heads and tails) sprinkles on ice cream is the best he\\'ll probably take your motorcycle and sunglasses too \\'it\\' i should say see, it is a pita i ate cream cheese carrot cake; however, camperbot did not attempt to stop me so, i\\'m thinking it is logging my glutenous consumption for later use  there\\'s a code review room i believe @jbmartinez what\\'s the room invocation yep.... help rooms there ^ codereview what\\'s your question @jimyallam  and  don\\'t see any col-xs-6 can you paste the code instead? (that is preferred to screenshots) yeah, you get a pass for that cause of the cute cats and all @dianka947 awesome. and you, also, thought about security right? (the putting it together part is very impressive) @markielock i was wondering the same about the wapoint url size (they\\'re mostly spaces) this might be helpful http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_encodeuricomponent.asp if you\\'re doing stuff from a home/local server.... doing some (imo a lot) of research on security approaches well save you some headaches  @iheartkode that looks pretty cool so far  i like the blur on the edge of image (i say this only because i know you like to work with images too) i like the code window background better (but there is a neat effect in the old one when you hover) have you been eating a lot of sugar, @shifthawke ? (admit it) you\\'re not chasing tootsie rolls with vodka are you ? lol  that\\'s so wrong cya ok, so it\\'s over linode and is virtual... better welcome @flight846  linux is awsome (my main os) so you get double points for setting up what you did (that\\'s great!)...i\\'m just a bit of a security curmudgeon don\\'t mind me (but good to talk about if you\\'re going to go wide audience) is that like ohana @oohhnnaa ? cool, welcome wow, steep drop in chat activity welcome @carito057  wait, an actual newspaper? like with paper and stuff? i had to read that twice (not a critique, some folks prefer tactile learning...) just interested in source article wow i don\\'t know why this amazes me (maybe because it\\'s halloween, here in us)  if it\\'s got peanut butter and choco... i\\'m sold gummies are good especially the worms (yes, i still buy those) $800 for a choco bar awesome @aoxom  no, you\\'re plugging along great... @aoxom  it\\'s #5 in intermediate @dwitjes89  i have to admit classic (or depending on what you think...ansi) c, is kind of interesting (have thought about actually finishing the book i have on it) (yes, made of paper) lol this thing is totally ancient (from the 80s) yeah regex is best learned with some starting point: http://www.regexr.com/ -- https://regex101.com welcome @ianhf  @antoniohoyen i\\'ve found debian based distros to be the least headache inducing generally speaking, it will be ubuntu (for least headache) ... repos are larger to draw (and in most flavors, easier package mgmt -but you have sub choices there too) @antoniohoyen  i tried fedora (a really long time ago, about the time you did) i didn\\'t like it so much i use kde (f unity - sorry strong feeling there) and use fallback + mate another distro (that uses enlightenment) based on ubuntu is bodhi... interesting but quirky as a guest i like the screen edges in kde mate is smooth and simple yeah, but it\\'s quirky... (i want to like it, but there\\'s some stuff that\\'s a pita) @phoenixlaef totally pretty much (by either installing kde (full) desktop) or using kubuntu mint is neat too... if they had lts i\\'d think about it seriously (played with mint for awhile) @phoenixlaef it\\'s been awhile since i looked at their download(s)... are they not doing rolling releases? that\\'s the magic cross domain thing @phoenixlaef funny you should mention that (i was on their download page) totally not fruitfal @phoenixlaef thanks (here\\'s some brownies lol) i think i\\'ll put mint on the list to play with in vm (it\\'s been awhile - but looks like they\\'ve grown a bit)   walking and using gitter is a bad idea i\\'m walking now i have to come up with the big data science idea you could pull stats if nyc taxi vs uber of i\\'m sure the taxi people would love you for that response times, satisfaction measures i don\\'t know how much of that date is available on either side data i\\'d go with uber but that\\'s just me i would look at the link however i don\\'t want to walk into a stop sign i\\'m  a bot noooo emotes  bots use those but don\\'t like them wasn\\'t worf (however you spell it)  also half human (like spock) there seem to be a self loathing (for human side) theme though the whole franchise  same here 100% bot nice but south america that\\'s f\\'d up  did you get environment path straightened out? no shell is a shell. windows used to be based on dos wayback in the day  you can add interactivity to shell scripts check out zenity i\\'m not a big mongo fan but certs don\\'t hurt bustin da rhymes  seriously though certs  can be good on a resume for backend  then there\\'s bench pressing i\\'m challenged you can run sql commands entirely and terminal if you like -and in lol i gave @jbmartinez his 666th brownie linus made a kernel that was unix like way back in the day.  the shell has to have an operating system to interact with  the shell doesn\\'t exist independently from is or kernel os f,ng auto correct noooo lol i have to use windows in some cases but it\\'s relegated to a vm. i just can\\'t stand windows now i like sql server though lol we bots are amused by the way you humans process organic material we bots have no need for such things. hail camperbot  no what do you use google translate for the exercises? that would be a great project you\\'re talking about credentials  your database credentials can be intertwined with your user account technically however those are completely independent concepts  database credentials aren\\'t tied to the operating system in fact it\\'s separate but if you want to you can sync those  you can add users and groups two different applications in linux to gitter is crapping out but database access is an entirely separate item user management is part of the database app you could have access to some items with in the database and some items not within the database does that make sense?  i\\'m on mobile and i\\'m trying to explain  database administration concepts what\\'s wrong with me?  lol gitter is crapping out peel is actually on my to do list perl i\\'m looking at it but mobile github is weird it bounced back to your main  i\\'m going to book mark it see i don\\'t hate its syntax like @jbmartinez does lol lol it\\'s funny javascript is looking less weird to me now i don\\'t know if that\\'s a good or bad thing that\\'s wrong lol hi 20,000 people no just sayin hi lol yeah that was the flavor i was going for same here @terakilobyte always is raising the bar and forcing me to think  i am yes that looks neat i have to switch to laptop can i bookmark this nice it\\'s weird and all open source but there still holdovers in things for me open enrollment? because that\\'s when everybody wants projects completed all of a sudden it\\'s like getting a bunch of emails at 5 pm on a friday never fails that\\'s deep @terakilobyte  didn\\'t you used to have an avatar with thumbs up ? codepen quietly does that? i\\'m into selectiveness is there auto magic in codepen as in quietly selecting libs i saw canada but i got lost somewhere in the conversation fcc rocks! i sometimes feel as though i am the marshmallow i\\'m on mobile that everything renders the same lol not  i think i\\'ll keep brackets (this is coming from somebody who likes  genie y wow  i\\'m talking into chat so proper grammar and spelling are out i like it if you want to go for speed sublime for me geany is fast and no nag  but i like brackets too it\\'s slow as f.  but the feature set is unmatched  whiteboard and marker that explains a lot lol free handing stuff verses dia like can get you there quicker for concepts everybody has their own style yeah but what if it\\'s heels with goldfish you may not want to copy welcome @kennyk3  @phajava lurks a lot lol totally but not at this second because of question and all @solineoz you\\'re in luck there\\'s a lot of folks who contribute to those here now (i\\'m not one of those lol) waypoints are not tied to cert i believe zip lines and base jumps. are the operative chime in anybody but you should have an understanding of html and css (won\\'t be able to do much without) i\\'m on stupid mobile @phajava  i shall have to boot up the old laptop brb @propersharp there was an extra newline appended to your hello welcome @emma-tzy-0917  @koouty hopefully you\\'re just using ie9 to just test - but this might be helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5472938/does-ie9-support-console-log-and-is-it-a-real-function @groundxaero having daylight savings and being reminded that ie(any version) is still out in the wild at the same time.... for some reason, made me chuckle @koouty if you must use ie, then you should probably upgrade it to highest version (or install chrome  or firefox hint, hint) doesn\\'t work hamsters with hats have no power over me lol about @elfborne  looks like whatever the error was resolved (or you signed in with github (good) try using gitter on mobile if you need a hand warmer stream buffers a lot (twitch) you are @allanarmstrong lol i i\\'m feeling anything but  my english sucks too  trinken i\\'ve stumbled into german chat dance like a butterfly code like a bee gitter has a billion rooms already bait and switch (if you want to have this \"extra functionality \") is a pain you\\'re what?

@farhanihmida welcome ok, errant linkedin profile just went by lol ```(\" \")``` split @lifeburner yep @judgebowser you have to give a reference to how you want to split... could be \" \" or \"whateverhere\" \"-\", and so on do you mind pasting your code?

but won\\'t i sound like bob dole? welcome @oldpastelsoul  @qmikew1 likes oatmeal  hey, what\\'s all this stuff about heroku and credit cards? (btw) oh, they\\'re using the microsoft model there are evaluation modes etc., (or even aws i think too) you can use (x) for (n) time but we won\\'t charge (not talking heroku specifically but... the have to have card thing) @saintpeter that\\'s a good tip @lifeburner exactly (azure) the first one was better lol no, your typo luckily it\\'s not the whole banana  i\\'d tend to agree with the openshift (if i had a mysql db behind app etc.,); however, there are still cases where sql server is \\'the thing\\' behind... and would say azure would be (begrudgingly)  better in that case  @lifeburner i just checked (thanks for link i\\'d (i\\'l) use openshift for more open source type stuff) they don\\'t offer the tier to your country ....that sucks @sangsatori are you on linux? @sangsatori if you want web based there are a couple of gpls among this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_time-tracking_software i didn\\'t really comb through the list.... so, can\\'t vouch for applicability/utility @lifeburner they\\'ll wait until you\\'ve got everything setup then....  *we\\'re sorry to inform you that your country doesn\\'t support our service* and... please don\\'t respond to this email lol @sangsatori build it i will use it now i want trout for some reason i dunno a bit of lemon and garlic could make that trout better i\\'m thinking about it i\\'ve got an ever growing list of things to \\'sign-up and create stuff on\\' going have to do codepen first ... so, i can get through my curriculum requirements @lifeburner i guess i could, don\\'t know about the whole blogging thing (not sure i could keep interest throughout post) lol @janitor93 remove the parenthesis --- they are for groups, you have a single item \\\\s ```replace(/\\\\s/g,\"\");``` will only remove spaces. but your original regex is malformed @janitor93  @janitor93 you\\'re just removing spaces there in that regex. take a look at http://www.regexr.com/... you probably want to specify *what you don\\'t want* in some cases (hint) read it or you\\'ll go mad hunting and pecking @qmikew1 wonders if starting a flame war about angular vs. react (to get away from the 3rd rail \\'politics & religion\\' ) would be effective @combsco i was looking through the vue.js site and it has alternate chinese and japanese sites... got me wondering.... what are the strategies that non english speakers use to code?  @lifeburner yeah, as it\\'s what you\\'ll see behind pretty much everything (code wise) ted talk isn\\'t going to work today (time wise) lol @jsommamtek i looked at on both mobile and desktop... (understand the footnote about codepen images not rendering etc.) the split pane thing is odd (for different reasons) in both @thec0mposer no idea... but it will *tell you* (by way of not working) if it needs it. i know build essential in the context of linux, (don\\'t know much about mac; however, there are some extra steps involved) i have to admit i was sitting in a coffee shop when i first did the initial exercises (and felt a little self conscious about having an app full of cats an a large laptop screen) lol  i *know* everybody was looking at me @clevertrout  well, that took a turn @thec0mposer that\\'s a pretty broad question.... depends on a lot of stuff.  your initial question was (i think, about some sort of addon for package management for mac) that\\'s \\'broad package\\' mgmt... node (e.g., and if you\\'re going to use it) has its own mgmt. etc.  install whatever database setup you\\'re going to use and try to update it... then make a determination. welcome @storbeck  bat person coming down off the sugar are you now i bet you feel yucky all sugared out and all (i know the carrot cake did it to me) with cream cheese knowledge of relational database concepts that would be the select query lo l go back to my first comment i don\\'t know the content of those lessons, but something is telling me that they\\'re not giving you foundational knowledge special? @thec0mposer it\\'s not meant to be insulting seriously i\\'m just saying, look into it a bit (it will make your journey infinitely  easier)... (i.e., read up on relational database theory (and/or a learn sql in x number of days book)  yeah i\\'m rooting for ya @thec0mposer  @roelver the board is cool it\\'s cool but depresses me (but, motivates!) yeah, but still depressing lol the only thing i don\\'t like about the leaderboard is it\\'s the same principal used by sales types oh look i ranked on the alternate (bitter leader) board! @kylebiancardi those will be crucial to subsequent exercises.... you\\'ll be looping through stuff a lot (in exercise and in programming in general) you could be looping through a string, an array blah, blah --creating counters etc. the list goes on yep it could be i, b, or larry if you wanted i like to eat sardines. if this doesn\\'t pan out... i\\'m going to be a professional sardine eater (contests and stuff) i will be #1 sardine eater... people will stare when i walk by and say \"is that the.... professional sardine master?\" and i\\'ll chuckle to myself \"ha, loathsome non-sardine master eaters\" @roelver can i make a suggestion? (when you look at your own rank, can there be info on the total from which it\\'s being pulled) like you\\'re nth out of nth  there\\'s also --  (e.g., i-- ) it does the opposite it decrements (but don\\'t get hung up on \\'i\\' it could be any name you give it) i agree (with js being more interesting) you\\'re not constrained by the curriculum, (can branch out on whatever technology you want) what  song ? oh yeah  i\\'m on mobile so i\\'m challenged with scrolling  @thec0mposer that is a sh^^ load of stuff. what rdbms vendor are you going to use? muppet scary muppet @thec0mposer i think you\\'re conflating package management with node (which has its own) to database stuff first step... pick what you\\'re going to work with (be it mysql, postgresql, ms sql server) list goes on (and i\\'m talking relational) @thec0mposer  the (really long) list of stuff had bulk bcp and ctes in it... that\\'s sql server (if i had to bet - ok, not bet that\\'s a ms list) what\\'s with the followers thing? would feel like a preacher or something oh, that\\'s scary yeah, and does it involve some compound in south america jimgroundxaerojones lol nc what\\'s this is it a state ? oh,  do people eat pork there? in nc and drink whisky oh, those are good i should move there and eat pork and drink whisky and eat gummies wait that sounds really good.... @lifeburner i came from similar background in terms of multicultural  welcome @vieira83  start with exercises and ask for help if you get stuck  that wiki (stub?) has some grammar issues @theodrick what took you so long, welcome aboard  *\"eide was aggressive toward staff and showed signs of intoxication of alcohol and/or drugs,\"*, really? i\\'m totally surprised, i mean breaking into a zoo and petting a tiger isn\\'t ..... lol (testing @joepurdy thanks!) hey, it\\'s still offline @joepurdy  @joepurdy (i was trying to test, because i saw your comment above... (feedback)) @urobert listen to your intuition, but delay it. if you get hung up on optimization too early it\\'s going discourage progress @abhisekp is it the fact that the room names (are in effect) hardcoded into the array? (just a noob learning question) got it @abhisekp yeah that jumps out at you  when you look at it they\\'re redeemable for toasters and office supplies  welcome @carlosandres22  i\\'d go with the online/book(s) resource(s)... (i mean that\\'s where a tutor (have never heard of that)) would be getting the information). + how do you know that you wouldn\\'t be picking up (potentially) bad coding habits of said tutor.? yes, but many universities (in terms of full courses) are behind on current technology @tmbbutler  but what i\\'m saying is that\\'s *transferable* to a tutor (i.e., the accreditation point). so, it would be the same thing but on a 1:1 basis (imo you\\'d be better off with online resources + books, but i get where you\\'re coming from, @tmbbutler )   @tmbbutler fcc has certs (that would be the demonstration (in part, and most clear to potential employers) i think, while it\\'s connected (learning and application) it\\'s different from the tutor thing.  i\\'m in bonfire\\'ville yep, i\\'ll (probably) be starting ziplines in a few days... (depending on my workload and how much i procrastinate here) oh, it\\'s back up nice lol i think @storbeck is using the drip method of suggestion  storbot status lol dang storbot is down storbot has either achieved sentience or somebody wrote a lot of recursive stuff somewhere lol it\\'s the hamster again welcome @dwydwys  think of the ipo potential   batperson! if i want to do the medium thing, do i have to have a picture (being a hand model, my hands are trademarked and all) both? yeah i agree should i use special lighting? oooh i\\'m thinking about it i know you ( @jbmartinez ) and @storbeck are going to (may have already done so) do it nice (digg) that was a good post (raising the bar) https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-you-should-be-using-bem-badcaa66371b really @jbmartinez ? your english is native speaker level (nuances, all that fun stuff). i can\\'t imagine that lol heya @abouleila  hey i got one what about a primer on sass?  yeah, you\\'re right (it\\'s hard to find the \\'something different aspect\\') what about a \\'when does it click (on the design side)\\'? like \"i found this moment when....\" (i\\'m describing in 3rd person... as this isn\\'t applicable to me lol) welcome @x30n1 , @isiomaogbuehi  there were two wwfs at one time (one with macho man randy savage, the other with pandas) one had to change their name to wwe (never been the same)...  @ametthey you will get plenty-o-plenty javascript learning here (understatement)  es6 weirds me out. there\\'s a lot of stuff that looks good (more efficient, etc.) and there\\'s support for it (not complete of course) but just something ... there\\'s a philosophy thing to javascript though, c might introduce some issues there if you\\'re planning to learn js as a first language (not that i have any issues with c, finishing my c book is like nbr 598 on my to do list) @qmikew1 blames @saintpeter for starting me down the path of snl skits with jon luvitz as the devil in the people\\'s court (much earlier post lol) @schmyriam welcome and, @sacmalad  fortune teller there was a lag  and... @storbeck will comment on elegance i got 2 out of 2 what?  you mean you responded before i guessed (impossible) lol well this better workout because my fallback as a licensed fortune teller + hand model seems shaky i know i complain about this but gitter really does push my mobile phone\\'s proc nice congrats on zipline siri can\\'t get most of the groups or titles correct when calling up itunes content google makes ms (potentially) of the early years (in terms of shenanigans) look small time  i don\\'t think they\\'re evil... but they have an enormous amount of influence of/over things.... (analytics isn\\'t passive)  $30.00 i didn\\'t buy one @qmikew1 hangs head in shame i\\'m going to use permanent marker and a screen projector to make my own hey, what about fcc decals (semi-seriously)? be cool to have a fcc case sticker to throw along os  @hiltydiggs that\\'s what i\\'m sayin bye @hiltydiggs  only issue i have with the swarm metaphor, is ants lay down extreme pheromone in cases other than food that\\'s pretty heavy stuff though (ant colony system (heuristics))... @terakilobyte am looking through it now (absorbing) or attempting to wow i went up to the index, the clever algorithms (all kinds of stuff) in the index under (other) programming paradigms, thought this was interesting (for what ever reason) *another example is the popular idiom of map-reduce which is an application of functional programming principles organized into a data flow model* @terakilobyte thanks for link (it has a lot of pointers ( in addition to its main thrust)) these are typically located next to the yoda figurines  ever find yourself wishing that there was a reverse caret ^ (other than lowercase v)? has to be in the lower bounds of the ascii (no not uppercase !) lol yeah i could render it with character codes, but not when i\\'m commenting  yeah but... &and; would look like this in my comment ```&and`` === this is what i\\'m doing up here.. (would make no sense) like this ^========== this is what i\\'m doing up here (in a comment) currently: (without a reverse caret (in lowerbound ascii set) \\nmy comment v==========this is what i\\'m doing down here (in a comment) just bugs me i can render all kinds of stuff in actual output, but my comments are dry nooo! lol ah, the lowly comment block... forever resigned to ascii art i can render... people. your application to the unicode consortium has been denied. lol that\\'s what i have but the reverse is limited to lowercase v like =============v no must have the reverse caret (magical , unicorn reverse caret) i know so, there is nothing beyond \\'v\\' because an entity character won\\'t render in comments would look like this ```&darr;``` and rendered in actual output (of course) would look like this &darr; that is pretty cool @storbeck  i can\\'t see where something not encoded in utf-8 (even at the editor level) would be an issue (even the crappiest have encoding options) just feels weird going outside the \\'keyboard set\\' in my comment blocks watch, there will be some change in future.... and after listening to you all my commented code will come alive and bork everything i\\'ve created lol it\\'s so subtle, that it works lol they\\'re neat if you want non-coders to stop talking to you, start talking about character encoding or star wars (less so, but really close) over coffee @balance17 yes. you will forget everything what\\'s endubueze will i be hit up for my creditcard @balance17 it will take repetition (so, be prepared to go back (google etc) and revisit lots of stuff .... over, and over... (it\\'s normal/expected) no magic @someshe welcome nooo yes, i comment like hell no, it\\'s for you no, \\'you\\' means collective people following /debugging later  (but yes, mostly for me )lol @jbmartinez deleted his calc because of @kimkwanka \\'s (awesome ) calc gee, that\\'s sensitive lol here\\'s the calc http://codepen.io/kimkwanka/details/vvqgpj @kimkwanka  (not mine) lol...  i used this cool thing called google it like gives answers n stuff @theodrick rock on with jquery @theodrick it will slow down a bit when you hit bonfires like in zoolander yes, bonfires @theodrick go to the map section of page take a look (not ominous or anything... this is when you really start getting into the challenging aspects) it\\'s safe @jbmartinez  @phajava made me link it yeah, i knew that\\'s what would would happen that calc is making me very uneasy about having to make one... (i\\'ll be like \\'bar has been set pretty high\\') stick with linux updates that you can\\'t opt out (i\\'m talking to you windows 10) totally annoy (and scare) me @theodrick you can do it rock on  specific distros aren\\'t really relative (ubuntu is good for pretty much everything) it\\'s the type of stuff that you install that makes your machine good for programming (technically ubuntu is partially based on debian) @storbeck you\\'ve had a 70% jump in brownies in like 3 days lol ok, like a week storbot no, i was just going by memory  from the other day/week the leaderboard is to me what the calc is to @jbmartinez  yeah, i think you should have a whole cra^ load (from actually contributing to curriculum) oh, that\\'s true i don\\'t think i\\'ve been to the help room  you\\'re going to do those (bonfires) again? no there\\'s more algorithm stuff (so, you would need to (probably) get a foundation in the basic first) imo i re-did those early waypoints because i joined at the cusp of a major update @saintpeter added more, so i\\'ll need to go back (same ocd @jbmartinez has) and do those too ah vb @dueldrawer8 wapoints (i belive) that looks like a guitar <--sits back for long discussion are vienna sausages or potted meat better? yeah totally this is why i\\'m like do i finish the codecademy angular? looks pretty clean that\\'s a broader (or could be) thing... a lot of employers demand (insert whatever here) and that drives a lot of stuff i agree (it\\'s a clue that company doesn\\'t pickup/adapt to new things) yes but you need to evaluate within an array against the other args welcome @mongos134 , @zacqinconel  the gitter emotes are weird... sometimes you can see a short delay in their rendering @quincylarson is there any kind of outreach planned for non-profits (which, granted are not monolithic) to get word out about fcc (like cross quora i guess you\\'d call it) lol @storbeck that\\'s a neat idea... the commercial could have camperbot being tackled by this guy-- *brown, who was signed by the rams earlier this week, stands at 6-foot-10, which is tall even for a lineman, and was said to be about 385 pounds* what\\'s dollar shave club? (no, i don\\'t work for it, whatever \\'it\\' is) lol hang brb to watch/search said item thanks @storbeck , @terakilobyte i love their motto @iheartkode how much of a difference (i.e., are you completely rethinking it, or sort of converting it?) date formatting is nice (but a bit of a pain in js) too ooh, that looks good.  @kimkwanka master calc maker  hey i\\'m just happy that there\\'s something for date/time formatting hi @storbeck  that was totally, unprompted (btw) \\'the people\\' i\\'ve wondered that too, because that pane is filled with irrelevant (imo) stuff they\\'ve been frozen in time @terakilobyte did you ever read omni magazine? i have no idea if it\\'s even still in print... but it was a popular science magazine from the late 1980s it partially updates (the pane) i\\'ve seen newer folks in a couple of the tiles from time to time but its logic or criteria is weird how do you reset history in the left pane? (as long as we\\'re on gitter) @dlomedes anything you need help with? i bet part of that image pane thing is gitter itself, it wasn\\'t designed for a team this size (i.e., there\\'s the team setup where, your team would probably be < 20 people (not >20,000) you\\'re too picky lol yes, must be congruent actually, i haven\\'t seen a lot of people that are on that pane in here i dunno you do? maybe you can\\'t see your own avatar (i don\\'t see it) weird @dlomedes i totally get that.  in fact, i should take my own advice and ask for help more often (but i\\'m more the type to do it for days going *i got this, dam^^*) lol sometimes i switch desktops between kde and gnome... kde\\'s battery widget \\'you\\'ve got (n) minutes left\\' gnome: zero power shutoff that\\'s wrong so wrong\\' yeah, me too....  i can see right away without editor hints or looking up what it says stock boat with whisky and solar panels now i have the styx song in my head that\\'s torture ahhh (actually, i\\'m one of the few people that preferred dennis de young to shaw) @bflatt72 you get brownie points for mentioning joe dirt thanks ooops gotta link your github ok, i\\'ve got styx song in head and i\\'m imagining the mullet (aka joe dirt) bad combo  i\\'m back in the 80s help yeah with the big patch on the back @kimkwanka i caught that when it first came out (i forgot the movie was forthcoming) it was a promo i was rolling i switched to mobile couldn\\'t get link to fire @terakilobyte  weird actually i have to admit that poison is in heavy rotation  sigh yes @quincylarson  javascript was underestimated. crockford\\'s comments about not being a hobby language totally come from late 90s.  yes welcome to debian based disto. now you\\'ll be able to get some work done. lol @storbeck you\\'re just sore about the mailing list for kerkel auto correct sucks  i don\\'t even mess with bsd welcome @gepser  poison you can put windows in a vm apple\\'s terms are tied to hardware. if you somehow get it to work lenovo don\\'t expect stability @qmikew1 is mindless robot microsoft devotes more time on checking your specs at startup than anything else yeah i agree it\\'s the gitter ssd is a great upgrade yeah cage match lol i wouldn\\'t mind the js and node stickers (and even ruby) i\\'m more stickers on the palm rest of laptop.... i just can\\'t get myself to put stickers on the lap cover yeah, the ruby would probably fit perfectly on left of trackpad hi @urobert  they are just tools. totally lol entities are fun yes @jbmartinez i run a script on (source long story) to catch spanish accent chars so i can convert yep lol hi @richacos  welcome @jbmartinez i do it in terminal too (highlights) i post one liner when i get to laptop storbot status check lol you have to convert it there\\'s no loop (also) for your isnot nvm i see where you\\'re calling it @mikebutts congratulations hey, we have similar screen names (except mine doesn\\'t have \\'butt\\' in it) lol turing! status = online (yes, bot overlord) butt? oh, i dropped the s (totally sorry about that) and yes, you\\'re doing great! @jbmartinez passed the turing test long ago  serious bot yeah pretty tree i know @jbmartinez it\\'s weird. @i-petko welcome your noob\\'ness will be short lived.. (going to learn lots) it would be cool if camperbot\\'s (which i\\'m thinking is possible) avatar changed along with its mood lol @awesomeaniruddh it would be neat to change up its (camperbot) appearance once and a while (i\\'m just wondering if in the api, its avatar could be changed based on (n)... but i\\'m thinking no because that would require, login rights ) linter in brackets (which i\\'m guessing is pulling in from node) is sort of a pain... would jshint make life easier? yeah, that is what i was thinking... eslint i\\'ve used (or evaluated) pretty much everything... except atom nice it has a .deb package if i see \\'.deb\\' featured in a page... i\\'m like hmmm (ok, nice) and stickers  yeah, that was a mistake (though i think what they were really saying was \"oh, no it\\'s linux\") i love linux i\\'ve got windows relegated to vm (i do have to use it) that\\'s *nix like though yeah, node was a really easy install... lubuntu has some issues with guest editions i\\'ve found (others disagree though) xubuntu seems to play nice with guest editions (if you want a liter distro) i\\'m not talking metric conversion (never mind spelling) i hear this sometimes about speed, in vm(s) - there\\'s something wrong about config somewhere oh, that\\'s a good idea! (dang another subject taken) lol eat? @lifeburner suggested that i do a setup on openshift and blog about it (sounds like a lot of work in between my lessons) linux vm(s) (or better yet, primary) setups sounds like a lot more fun klingon layout works for me daylight saving (in us) is so weird, it\\'s dark outside already i don\\'t feel like i\\'m saving anything though well yeah that\\'s true but, i don\\'t need it in the morning we\\'re in the same earth sector lol @arielleslie i\\'ve read about the origins (i think at some point) but i just don\\'t get the need yeah, that part i don\\'t like either: (getting dark earlier) totally well, i\\'ve dissed daylight savings time. i feel like i\\'ve accomplished something today darn sommerzeit (now i have a name other than dst to direct my ire ) sommerzeit = easy derailment of node on linux vs. windows convo (sorry) welcome @kulinp   wait, there\\'s a big casino gambler? js really shed its browser confines (hard to grasp from late 90s perspective ) @lfried-ndd welcome i\\'m going to have product placement in my portfolio.  companies pay you if you have cheese wiz strategically placed in frame vb6 i had to get over the hobby language rep. that totally messes with grasping philosophy  we\\'re no slouches in production (u.s. ) doing nothing brings the most regret i\\'m on mobile. no deep philosophical chat. one liners for me. lol took me a minute to read that as quote  nice @paulduncan21 best advice: start it serves pizza you have to invoke the the hal easter eggs full? is that a trident? i\\'m on a small screen but it looks like somebody riding s dolphin sorry i couldn\\'t answer your email. this thing called gitter sucked the life from my battery lol need > i don\\'t think it\\'s browser k is prompting me for login i do missing \" follow the example syntax code isn\\'t reponsive on mobile. that sucks. i get half blocks. gitter th a n ks well you must be using hexchat @abhisekp lol the classic \"person entered room\" irc thing i don\\'t know am on mobile while booting my machine. i\\'m considering an irc client if it\\'s fast @abhisekp i might give it a go @rolandisimo try username (vs. user) in your connection string if we go hindi only i\\'ll have to pay google for their translation api just to chat lol @kprenesti those aren\\'t the only chars you need to filter out @kprenesti regex is the stumbling block you\\'re encoutering. try http://www.regexr.com/\\nexperiment a little (read the tips in left pane). you\\'re not capturing everything also, [\\\\,] (isn\\'t a good pattern for a number of reasons) and will only capture , @kprenesti we all have our kriptonite  angular is hard (i\\'m on the fence because, i sense \\'a change ah comin\\' (react) about delving deeper into codecademy\\'s lesson) @catapixel is it pretty far out (not the 60s term) then? for implementation i don\\'t think learning angular (in its current iteration) is a waste...  stuff changes a lot (might as well get used to it) @kprenesti tip: you can overwrite the default text in regexr and test with your own. you can experiment with + (your question) but you may want to familiarize with \\\\w you can sort of see what\\'s in (as well as referencing it) by https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js i blame you (all) for forgetting i had yogurt (not the greatest thing warm) lol @jbmartinez i have the terminal one-liner (and went further for regex (which is probably more helpful) to detect spanish chars ```\\n//spanish accent chars\\n//these are one-liners i\\'ve used (pulled from net)\\n//in terminal you can do: grep --color=\\'auto\\' -p -n \"[\\\\x80-\\\\xff]\" yourfile.txt\\n//(to highlight)\\n//in regex\\n/[\\\\u00e0-\\\\u00fc]/g\\n//will capture\\n//á, é, í, ó, ú, ü, ñ\\n``` oh, item 6000 read the sass preamble (on the ever growing list of things to do) hash with number invokes the gitter bug tracker (oops) issue not found lol @sangsatori yes, it will suck all productivity from your soul why are solutions even viewable?

(because you could have keys for decryption to those you define as \\'folks authorized to view\\') @abhisekp i see what you\\'re talking about (more of a no-sql, approach and firebase specific) a group of radio buttons (properly id allows one sellection i made the mistake of trying to answer a question on mobile... let\\'s do this again @msd1391 \\nradio buttons (when setup properly) allow a single selection (like do you want apples, oranges, or potatoes?) check box allows multiple checks  @msd1391 \\n```\\nselection purposes\\n\\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_checkbox_name.asp\\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_doc_getelementsbyname.asp\\n\\n<!--\\nvar x = document.getelementbyid(\"mycheck\").name;\\n- or -\\nvar x = document.getelementsbyname(\"fname\");\\n-->\\n``` indiana jones and the temple of dom also, too...you\\'d lose the ability to group radio buttons into a logical set (i.e., where one is checked others can\\'t be ... without id or name etc., the question would be which buttons? where? i like brackets  and geany  @iheartkode i know your tutorial link was just an evil plan to make me learn ruby welcome @emjayess  sublime is fast there are a lot of tools (for whatever insert here)... i don\\'t spend a lot of time dissing (unless it\\'s windows lol... but still use it because i have to) because you should use whatever you need to get the job done... install all the editors ! snake case sss your handle must be the same @iheartkode it pops up in rails forum first ranking lol well no follow for you @iheartkode  lol that\\'s the point, i don\\'t even use twitter or facebook (i know right?) thinking about it though @iheartkode , i will let you and @jbmartinez know...

(they have signature arrows) separate those (classes) by spaces @hungrysteven only a few more, and you have numeric palindrome @abhisekp  thanks @abhisekp  (now it\\'s +3) @urobert nothing wrong  with taking a break and regrouping  something has to === 0 in your if statement you\\'re not comparing something, in its current form @mrankins  lol go for the \\'break and regroup\\' string: \"heads\" and \"tails\" not heads (because you haven\\'t defined anything) so it would be \"heads\" as string is flip what you should be comparing? (been awhile since i was on that) it is it\\'s a variable name that is a number np @mrankins it will come to you (i promise) wait until you get to the bonfires\\n well, let\\'s just say you\\'re not cooking marshmallows (you are the marshmallow) lol no, they are practice whatever pace you\\'re most comfortable... do it. (and you can always ask questions) yeah, the community here is really great (it sets fcc apart (aside from the hard skills aspect which it has as well)) i signed up with codecademy (what seems like eons ago, well before fcc) but there\\'s a motivation piece (as well as sort of disparate technologies to learn)) that\\'s missing yeah, codecademy is still good as a secondary reinforcement ( @arielleslie makes a good point) repetition... there\\'s no way you\\'re going to get nuances (or even straight forward stuff) without doing @mrankins there have been some changes, but i see that you probably need to read up (and experiment) with/on regex http://www.regexr.com/ @bflatt72 there aren\\'t a lot of ror haters (in fact, if you read some blogs etc., you\\'ll find that-that was what a lot of folks may have moved from to create fcc (have no unique insight or anything)) so, that gives me some indication on javascript and its place in comparison  @mrankins break it up into chunks (and maybe make tiny milestones etc., for example: mess around with the regex sites and experiment, then reward yourself etc.) then go on to the next thing... or (and) do some reading (eloquent js e.g.,) or (and) reinforce the js aspect with codecademny @mrankins if you want to learn regex from a lesson perspective ( @abhisekp \\'s video link is good as well) you can try: http://regexone.com/ then do your own experimentation with http://www.regexr.com/ (there are tips in the left pane) ok, i\\'ve done enough *serious typing* i\\'m ready to talk about cheese dip again @qmikew1 wishes velveeta was more economical @econ17 welcome (and as a side effect you can, now , tell when the engineers are bs\\'ng you) i want to try node-sass thought? s uh, huh.... business is business is node-sass bad? (like nobody comments as if it were some horrible disease that\\'s associated with folklore) when in doubt, npm\\' it nc weather is all over the place find cbot find gitterbot  welcome @mlosa001  came up in an audit, so @jbmartinez had to start over turn your speakers down if you do the frequency pen on that codevember lol i dunno, life by \\'the collective\\' (polls) sound f\\' up to me lol hey, what color shirt should i wear? (fill in poll) (yes, absurd (but not really) extreme) lol hello @nikolaisaganenko  no yes, it\\'s a great curriculum  i\\'m hearing love boat theme in alternate languages for some reason lol it\\'s advanced ai storbot that is we programmed modesty into the storbot they couldn\\'t have chosen a better song (by the pixies) for the ending wow i am jealous i could do that i had a flashback seeing the joust game if they only had star castle lol.... i just noticed the themed drinks sadly i never envisioned gen-x being aarp candidates it will be filled with oatmeal i\\'m just waiting for my discounts true, and 400-800 years it will be the same for those folks maybe earth will be a vacation spot for squid people by then (you never know) i know kung fu! show me they might take zoolander for reality and send the fleet i have to read the fermi paradox that would work only thing, is it\\'s theory based on a small sample  when the squid people come, they will disagree welcome @btbinhtran  philosophically (if you were taking the perspective of other species on this planet) we may well be the squid people.  we find stuff in very deep parts of the ocean that we didn\\'t know existed...(based on our known observational knowledge) so, we couldn\\'t predict that we would find those not so much, we know that dinosaurs had a life cycle --of course--(not because) we observed it (but based on carbon dating, clues about environment etc.)  jsx ah, xml again (not a xml hater) yeah, have to wrangle that stuff you missed jsx is react easier to learn than (well, you know) @jbmartinez i still have to look (slightly off topic) at your pure-sass so, react is more js in its  \\'ways\\' ? yeah, why are they doing that? but there are legacy issues with javascript because of their influence (if you agree/believe crockford and others) on ecma in the early days,   could typescript be to  angular, the same thing? they\\'re going to have homegrown angular.... but i think it\\'s still codeschool for now (but i skipped to codecademy for that) weird the regex needs to be tweaked a bit (i mean c o n tr o ll er s are going to come up a lot in angular convos) browser cache? it would have to be trollololol http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html\\n*xml has the benefit of balanced opening and closing tags. this helps make large trees easier to read than function calls or object literals.* @jbmartinez ^ ?? hey, dude people trying to help.... mind the trolling invective(s)  i don\\'t know who i\\'m talking to lol @bwieland86 we were talking about camperbot and its regex with regard to \\'con tro ller\\' when? (react)  @quincylarson i\\'m kind of on the fence about committing to learning angular (react just seems to be on the horizon for everything)... i\\'ve gotten a lot of good feedback for learning both etc., but i\\'m like hmm  hi @bruglesco  sure (tip they\\'re usually separated by spaces)... can you paste your code? @eniergray  yeah take out \"\" between smaller-image and thick-green-border rock on  @eniergray get used to it (everybody racks their brains on some simple syntax thing) welcome @katwalla  taking notes, etc. (ever vigilant bot) i can\\'t judge the merits but red flags go up whenever i see \\'seamless upgrade\\' what am i getting points for again? oh, i see lol you\\'re absolved go forth and procrastinate no more  i had to bale on that article on about the 4th paragraph, as it seems to be arguing for less innovation and more structured vis-a-vis (programmers aren\\'t professionals etc.)   licensing/education like \\'engineers\\' ducatti? honda (there was a naked model bike) lol that\\'s a keeper quote @quincylarson  did you try it in brackets? well, the clickbate worked i\\'m reading the article lol maybe \"why do programmers over complicate things?\" i\\'d read that i\\'m learning that but functions have scope (or all scope is in function right?) lol they will mock you just saying so is kind of \\'how shall i say it\\' mean yeah, they are sharp as f over there.... (some of the answers on so) yes, devalue the currency all in one paragraph lol lentils and fried chicken bottom part is chicken it\\'s supposed to be serenity yeah, i would be too @abhisekp  i was going to say hello, but the wall of code no, i\\'m just kidding @mattmun  @jedpimentel i promise i don\\'t have any decals affixed to me you need some regex there http://www.regexr.com/ @abhisekp i\\'m going to bookmark that (and see what kind of answers you get) yeah, i saw that... it was almost instant @abhisekp oh, so that\\'s how they do that yeah i\\'m not seeing it yet holy cow are you still messing with that @abhisekp ? you are determined lol darn i would look but have limited scroll on mobile gitter yeah i noted that too  and found no back tick on mobile. great epiphany: jshint will likely make things easier for me than standard is it better? that i like i\\'ll look at that (have to switch to laptop before pulling my hair out) @terakilobyte so, i got the .eslintrc file off the main repo. is this, in essence, a config file for eslint?   \"\" why do you want to define an empty string? (other than avoiding, perhaps, \\'undefined\\') it\\'s almost 3:00am here, don\\'t mind me  serenity  i was going to make it \"serenity through code\" but it wouldn\\'t fit  lol nice to meet you as well @dbzdxw  @amgranad this is very javascript intensive you will learn a lot  nice thanks @terakilobyte and @abhisekp ... yeah, good catch... i didn\\'t look to see if there were any other file references in the config. so, it looks like there\\'s a npm for eslint for cli....so, i could invoke (with reference to config) the linter on a .js file  i swill coffee like a fiend wait, iced coffee is coffee oh, milk and sugar? there was a tasty iced-coffee (well, iced cappuccino) made by a company called ito-en (don\\'t know if it\\'s still around)  i can only drink sweetened coffee if it\\'s cold.... weird is c9 cra^^y it looks good  @abhisekp does brackets pull linter info from node itself (i.e., i\\'m wondering if i could tweak this eslint into brackets via node for real-time (if upon save is real time and all)? \"why would you do that?\" why not? lol i just spent some amount of time reading up on this they should i guess you can sanitize based on *known* patterns...but that\\'s the problem you can sanitize strings to strip out tags and (sql related stuff, which is an entirely different discussion @jbmartinez ) it\\'s a good site for regex, yes. (and you\\'re interested in regex.. that\\'s great!) - (you see a lot of \"i just want to get past this exercise\" stuff) predefined choices  oh, i forgot about that i always have problems with twitch my eye twitches when i use it but i don\\'t think that\\'s the intended effect seriously though, it\\'s not the most performant why not ask for review before you actually create it?  welcome @infinityxcx  @faizaanceg oh, i see you\\'re looking for actual review from maintainer  yeah, even with formatted lol @jbmartinez camperbot *can* read your thoughts: it\\'s pulling from the uri geller api it knows you were going to say that i think you get bot-overlord brownie points when you compliment it when you insult it (bot overlord)... it adds an extra 20 minutes to whatever you\\'re cooking in the microwave now you know lol i\\'ve never heard \\'chipping away that which is not david (or similiar)\\' used in programming context... yes, grow the unix beard lol hi @dukbcaaj  btw (the *nix admin look is great) @jedpimentel that is ( @dukbcaaj is probably thinking what the hey, hey as i interjected a hello mid paragraph) lol does rogaine work on your face too? talking about rogaine @groundxaero  hello nuqneh (one of the very few advantages bing has over google: it translates klingon) i got that from @jbmartinez so he is (total) nerd lol @jedpimentel i worry that the intended effect isn\\'t precise.

custom scripts? i may have to cut my teeth on grunt or gulp (as a learning thing (not for production)) before i get to the tweaking aspects @michael-krebs nice (the concept is familiar with bash scripting on linux) i\\'m seeing what you\\'re saying @ericelliott https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts in terms of stripping away stuff and getting to cheerio looks interesting (sorry, side reading the links) i think one of the key ingredients to being a good programmer is the perspective: \"what am i doing wrong\"? --i see the opposite with bugs reports (all that fun stuff to the right)  (\"my test failed, must be a bug\")   yeah, the npm scripts thing kind of clicked just now (though, i will learn the hard way with grunt or gulp to figure out just why...) if you\\'re doing a sort remember that default behavior is lexigraphical np it may or may not help with this particular exercise but sometimes you\\'ll get unexpected results if you\\'re sorting numbers without knowing that hey, ! cbot where\\'s my brownie camperbot is just sore about the sweat stained t-shirt comment and is now stealing my brownies yeah @khaduch compound declarations with a single var is neat (other langs have this too)... the only thing (and this is entirely preference) is if you have all kinds of types (yes, there\\'s loose to no typing) it might be easier on the eyes to group those with with blocks on separate lines... maybe just me yeah, especially when vision begins to go @invisigram \\n```\\nfunction justsomefunction(){\\nvar z = 5\\n\\nfor (var i = 0; i < z; i++){\\n     var q = \"b\";\\n    console.log(\"just random stuff\");\\n}\\n    console.log(\"i am q\\'s value: \" + q);\\n}\\n\\njustsomefunction();\\n\\n//displays:\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff\\n//just random stuff                                                                       \\n//i am q\\'s value: b\\n``` yeah, it\\'s totally a preference thing @invisigram i forgot to add... that q is available to the function... but if i tried to use it with another function it wouldn\\'t work (good)... your question about global as @jbmartinez said would be to omit the var and like he said (that would be bad) it could be used globally  as an aside, i\\'m still trying to digest closures... so am no guru i saw on the fcc twitch (ok, i replayed it on youtube) that there\\'s going to be a job board (where folks can apply based on 1. front end cert , 2. full-stack (or both)) it\\'s in production? did i click some ancient link like hey, i heard of this new thing called the internet (late to the game type of thing) oh, well.... sounds neat either way (even if i\\'m the last person to have heard of it) no comfy solace can be found with unplugging and cuddling up with a windows 98 machine. stuff changes lol welcome and howdy @blacknight318  i was totally second guessing the link i clicked, i blame @jbmartinez  lol welcome @emmy12345  @sarahdlc \\n```\\n<!--generic application:\\n1. create the class\\n2. specify stuff\\n3. reference it in the element specified\\n-->\\n<style>\\n<!-- 1. ===v -->\\n.theclassnameyoumade{\\n<!-- 2. ===v -->\\n\\twidth: 575px;\\n}\\n</style>\\n\\n<img class =\"theclassnameyoumade\" src=\"https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat\">\\n<!--3 =======^ -->\\n```\\n awesome you will be challenged though  type colon.. and select from drop did you login with github?

oh, nice... you must have pro version of codepen is it worth it for the pairing aspect? i forgot, about the resume linkage aspects so, the pro thing makes sense (in addition to the pairing) np @sarahdlc  yeah, the asset uploads is really a big sell i\\'d do it for just that @emmy12345 goto the wrench and screwdriver icon ... then click notifications .... then select/tweak to your liking the visualizer idea reminds me of this skinable windows media player back in the day. can\\'t remember its name yeah! that\\'s pretty cool (am in mobile)  you\\'ve got your own domain nice lobe it too (ear pun music app and all) that would be nice i\\'d say do it on something other than phone i\\'m chatting from phone and it\\'s less than ideal (coding on it would make me barf) that\\'s it play hard to get until spotify ups the offer. lol itunes has become a serious pita yeah, i think that\\'s what\\'s starting happen is it blocked for currency ? @jbmartinez i think that multiplies (whatever their intended) effect @carten congrats.  i saw that (cheerio) on link from earlier are there good (yes ff has some built in) mobile simulators ? it helps going to the 80s bar? got it. saw blazer yep @el-sloth86 welcome feels weird saying hello to a sloth  just language dissonance on my part lol howdy @bruglesco  which? i often wonder if there\\'s some daemon in gitter (due to the weird lags) that\\'s doing some kind of process mgmt lol that so link took me on a journey  stack overflow  i think what prompted the question was async and defer i wish ie8 would go somewhere and... the spartan\\'s defensive formation is certainly applicable to microsoft  bye @el-sloth86  lol wordpress and php was what he was advocating i think you have a numeric palindrome  e e it\\'s been out longer than that same here on my vm are you talking about drawing in svg (i.e, manipulating values for animation like stuff ) that\\'s cool stuff huh? no way (held hostage by raster) no really it wasn\\'t  but i do work with svg sometimes in simple context i\\'ve got so much on my list now. cheerio, grunt, sass , svg, doing my actual curriculum requirements. lol what\\'s sad about that troll is he/she lost out (based on their sheer stupidity) on a chance to kearn learn not font actions in printing lol and incoherent  there are city/location meet ups.  if there isn\\'t one in your area. i think you\\'re encouraged to start your own.  start the vacuum of space coffee and code lol although depressurization is always a concern and can be discouraging what am i being thanked for again?  oh, check yes, and free toaster getting closer oh, no problem @emmy12345  @kimkwanka wow i swear @kimkwanka is far across the ocean in germany @emmy12345 bonfires are where you begin to meet  more challenging exercises (with javascript)  me and @jbmartinez are geezers. we should play checkers together lol lol playonlinux is a nice front-end for wine (just random  thought ) @abhisekp you can\\'t have that or meat lol @kimkwanka you did another hackintosh? you\\'re addicted @tanasic i would google for bootstrap alternatives (foundation etc., ) what do you mean by manual responsiveness?  you can still do that in css even if you have bootstrap referenced bye @kimkwanka  it\\'s now cold in nc yesterday it was hot.  @pasportit i can deal (just wish there was some cosistent pattern) must download @storbeck \\'s essense it\\'s very possible, but be careful (on the side languages can build up fast, and maybe cause confusion) same here in fact, that\\'s very apropos for my monday  hiya @latebloomer  if you pay attention (to comments, summits and the like) react is coming (don\\'t know when) @saintpeter i saw a brief walk through (you tube) from yesterday.  what is it exactly? (o\\' mastic) matic @saintpeter oh, see. so, this will (in essense) enable quicker content delivery (which makes sense by its namesake ) i looked at the example (though in mobile atm) i can see how that would be true  heya @agoalofalife  @milpool welcome your days (with high probability) of sucking at js are over  there\\'s a cra^load of js instruction (in a good way) and exercises it (the exercises) give you some context on where/how to apply it please make it responsive (try using chrome\\'s request desktop feature-- you have to do a hard restart to reset) is this a running commentary on the regex fixes that need to be done i\\'m pretty sure mondays (even if in your country they\\'re called something else) universally suck i wonder if the strings could be put into a queue for evaluation (would probably be really non-performant) to fire multiple commands (late night thoughts on cbot) hiya @detchison  ^the first try at the percentage sign in early history  many arguments where had about the number of circles the ones with sour cream flavor ? they leave a film of oil that gets on keyboard but not as bad as cheetos i\\'m not following (but i\\'m guessing you\\'re troubleshooting a pen) the whisky may affect learning retention good evening people is good too that totally fooled me (i\\'m like what\\'s the glitch) now you have to un-stick it in your head can you paste your code? was that an errant th a n ks @dcsan ? lol oh, it was a test \"t h a nks\"  @dcsan does camperbot still pull the same from the wiki aspect (i.e., since it\\'s (wiki) been moved (because of issues with public) to its own pr setup) @abhisekp  oh i see the sync aspect (just a change on one side ) yeah that\\'s kind of cool (side effect) you could edit locally angular taunts me why not just drop the name from 2.0 new official build name angularreactingtoreact @jbmartinez that blog cuts right to the nub yeah but look at the blog too it was the storbot i have to look at it in laptop @jbmartinez (weather example) probably why my results are different never noticed the shadow in logo yeah how easy (or difficult) would it be to implement a site status feature @jarlinton welcome  @combsco kind of (those are some cool metrics) but i\\'m not sure some of the stuff could be pulled automatically (i.e, there\\'s some manual interaction between report and identification e.g., bonfire, zip line sub) wall of wiki welcome @paulduncan21  i am not an android (can\\'t vouch for others) see,  sup @kimkwanka  no just ready to take in monday on but your hackintosh adventure does have me curious yeah i\\'m more linux but i don\\'t discount stuff don\\'t be @jazzthespazz  am on mobile (scroll challenged) why the multiple jquery references @tesla809  those are loaded sequentially and are redundant. but i get what you\\'re saying oh no, it is monday    good morning yeah, what\\'s the question? litigious society  @qmikew1 watches battery drain @rya-prajapati what kind of issues are you running into? was that a tumbleweed that just rolled by welcome @rpeleias (late reply but still...) so, i\\'m a linux user but have some windows vms. anybody have any issues with iso install on win10? welcome @sparvata  hey @jbmartinez did you do in-place or iso? (or, have you done it yet (remember you mentioning) i\\'m not excited, but might as well... did you need help @jamierez  (or do)?? cool why not put quotes around @urobert you should be able to access it by adding quotes... but if this is what you\\'re after:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13693580/how-to-make-a-document-getelementbyid-value-into-an-integer-variable-not-a-stri may or may not be helpful yeah, so the quotes around should return ... right (or am i missing something) @urobert do you have this in a pen (so all can take a look)? @urobert don\\'t know if it\\'s applicable or not, but you may need to use parseint() on that (because it returns a string) --i could be wrong as it may coerce and such...but\\n```\\nvar time = document.getelementbyid(\"sessiontime\").textcontent;\\nconsole.log(time);\\nconsole.log(typeof(time));\\n\\n//displays\\n25 (index):25\\nstring \\n``` yeah, i figured js would figure out for you what to \\'type\\' it as. brownies to @storbeck thanks (from urobert x2) see, you can \\'brownie on behalf\\' nope, camperbot has determined that you can only help once... so, if you have a compound issue.. you\\'re sol lol heya @rpeleias  go webased @misslea  https://repl.it/languages if you want to do it locally, node.js is good @iancolenutt there\\'s a \\'sign in with github\\' button on the main fcc page...

i didn\\'t either @groundxaero until a discussion on here about it i igor wanting to learn fortran for legacy banking app.  wish me luck ty @storbeck  i know this cobol the implement stuff out and ahead  they i like ff btw will i get linux beard if i click that link you must be doing the calc project i like the blue led segment font there is more punctuation to deal with @groundxaero it\\'s cool pen for some reason i\\'m craving one of those nasty costco (or sam\\'s club) lasagana(s) that\\'s what powers ie (it\\'s totally fart compliant) \"we\\'re a ms shop\" \"how do you feel about that?  oh that\\'s really cool (hey, can be a sellout if need be) yeah i actually like ms\\' database stuff (unrelated) mono in wine is a pita it\\'s a dependency for some stuff  so the app that would run in wine is using a mono dependecy layer @storbeck i\\'m talking about what app that runs in wine may have to use (not directly mono because of its linux ness) to https://www.linux.com/learn/answers/view/910-i-have-just-switched-from-win7-to-zorin-ubuntu-i-have-been-working-with-an-ai-program-called-verbot-for-awhile-and-my-question-is-how-do-i-run-it-and-net-framework-on-zorin-please-help  doesn\\'t matter anyway. if i need to do ms stuff i just fire up a windows vm (some stuff is sketchy ) that\\'s the spirit! git in non dev contexts would make world happier place (concept wise) i\\'m a git noob i\\'m afraid i will be shamed on a pr  like some response like \"no you tard your revision sucks and is rejected\" this is what i fear is tard or sucks omitted? i\\'m just sayin what every noob is thinking  we have revolution now is by far the winner on comment i will commit (no pun intended) to some req in next two weeks hopefully not on a repo whose maintainers are not in the midst of revolution   the psychology aspect i think should be covered with git use neck bolts on it just kidding can you paste your code @josebarakat  and electricity  i\\'m all about being up front with my dev related insecurities. maybe be the anne landers if medium of your reflex needs to account for all punctuation inducated regex indicated (mobile auto suggest grrr) \\\\w will not catch it all (a lot but not all) use regexr to test it\\'s hackish but | can be used in pattern it\\'s an or operator but not the best way.  well i\\'m just giving you a hint because i want you to solve on your own tiles? looks like tiles i don\\'t either @decocode welcome @storbeck are you and @terakilobyte going to make a new zipline already in the hopper? cool beans you pay a crapload for one  yep you can use an express version of mssql 10gb i think for free download the express version you can use addons (don\\'t know about latest version) learn both @thec0mposer aren\\'t you supposed to be learning full stack (which in this case is more of no-sql approach ) lol @azlorenzolopez hello, welcome check nice. congrats @pdewouters  that is cool @progmacattack i think i remember the pen that went with that most people help others independent of brownie points. there are quirks in the method (e.g, saying hello should not garner a point of some kind) but the community is actually pretty nice and wants others to do well it sets fcc apart imo camperbot isn\\'t sentient @n832sv i think if you\\'re questioning motivation (in a metaphysical context) @storbeck actually contributed to the curriculum and didn\\'t have any \\'points\\' until very recently so yeah with qualifiers  not that that\\'s bad or anything (question in itself ) make sure node is up to date or it will b^^^^ about versioning conflicts with npm (this is what happened to me with a stale ubuntu version ) that\\'s a good idea you also need to return the var ok i\\'m on mobile (can\\'t scroll ) but i thought i saw 0 in return. you may want to return the var (the calculation assigned to ) and return that  it looks nice (and might find niche bc words joy and hr aren\\'t usually seen together) nc nothing but rain all the time. like seattle sans the cool factor  there are a lot of people from nc. they just don\\'t admit it.  wait, i\\'m not supposed to use semicolons? i do after every var and return not so much to end functions though  sounds like a medium article just begging to be written how is js minified (not the tools per se) got it so it\\'s just removing a lot of readability cra^ for humans. (smaller file size i guess ) is there really a gain in performance that\\'s definately a factor i can see that with compression  that\\'s interesting jquery cdn gives both options min vs etc some jquery video got me started on this i\\'ve been wanting to experiment with materialize-css it looks nice out of the box still experiencing issues with that ? (can understand the frustration ) @bwieland86 i remember this from the other day. did you try touching base with codeschool help? so you\\'re in sort of a bureaucratic limbo with codeschool. that sucks codecademy has an angular course if you want to practice while waiting for codeschool response i have completed it though havent codepen is a separate setup issue independent of both though @bwieland86 what you may want to do is search pens tagged with free code camp. there should be a lot of example in how folks have incorporated angular examples  there are proprietary webkits that vary by browser  extensions to standard and the like totally confusing i know that we have to build stuff that\\'s responsive; however, i find even really well done stuff a pita to use in mobile totally you can feel that sometimes hiya @nicky171  @storbeck do they have people in teams (generic terms) that are supposed to do mobile and others traditional? only rather in general dev shop it might be better to go smaller rather than get locked into one or the other sans the app dev i don\\'t know i guess it\\'s good to know all bc larry (or insert gender neutral name) the mobile guy could be out on sick leave @danielrob your sounds like a good working vibe yours i think the size (as stated) and really the type (maybe even more importantly) of org drives that it would be neat to have a dev centric survey (satusifaction) broken down by employee size and stuff (an and mobile si spelling is out) see? on mobile and totally incoherent lol welcome @rosandoval  welcome @iliyaj (if it makes you feel any better i had vb6 on a machine at one time) welcome @gold-rims  there are a lot of folks willing to assist. feel free to ask questions if you get stuck what are you stuck on, @soumyarauth ? @soumyarauth you may want to paste your code (what you have so far) and folks will give you help/feedback explain format welcome @blackbond007  what kind of coding did you used to do ? nice. this is definately a good place to either brush-up/expand/or learn from scratch, javascript @blackbond007  @amarchhetri the quotes work, and are passed to twitter.... looks good @blackbond007 what\\'s this? you don\\'t find re-imaging boxes and dealing with *\"challenging\"* support questions to be satisfying? heresy. lol not in tech support, but have a good idea what it\\'s about @dxmartin8  that\\'s a valid pattern for space; however, you need to account for punctuation try http://www.regexr.com/ and experiment (there are tips in the left pane) @dxmartin8 can you paste what you have so far? @dxmartin8 so, apply what @arielleslie showed you... -and- read up a bit on regex...(because of the punctuation thing) and you should be good to go i would be cool to make an actual slice of pizza stand on its end like that. @urobert do you have a code example? can you elaborate? @urobert it\\'s your test the value was pulled from a string (even though it looks like a number) and you\\'re evaluating against a string hang on a second... @urobert we all know about the lack of typing in js but i\\'m convinced that since you pulled that value as text it\\'s affecting your (if condition)....example:\\n```\\nvar i = \"0\";\\n//^===exercise in \\'stringness\\'\\n//and test if value will be coerced\\nif (i === 0){\\n    console.log(\"i\\'ve been coerced into a number\");\\n//this won\\'t happen by the way\\n    \\n} \\n\\nvar q = 0;\\n\\nif (q === 0){\\n    console.log(\"i am indeed a number\");\\n}\\n\\n//v========this part is (what i think you need)\\nvar x = parseint(i);\\n\\nif (x === 0){\\n    console.log(\"i\\'ve been converted to a number\");\\n} else {\\n    console.log(\"i\\'m totally wrong\") \\n}\\n```\\n i could be totally wrong as well (keep that in mind too, @urobert ) lol totally the opposite (learning style). give me a high-level overview and some applied examples and am good... gaming thing drives me crazy @rchipman yeah, i\\'ve been meaning to check that out @zaixeno you won\\'t...(and we don\\'t mostly)... it\\'s totally about repetition  yeah go through the bashing-your-head-against-machine (not literally ) phase...it means you\\'re making some progress eloquent is good you might want to use an additional processing array to grab (and process) stuff using substring and .push @goletian https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/refresh-your-browser-cache (incognito tab will probably do it (i.e., fix) though) http://www.techrepublic.com/article/multidimensional-arrays-in-javascript/ when arrays get too complex my brain stops processing (those) camperbot is love it\\'s already sentient congrats @yuyao17  welcome @jbmartinez  javascript ist besser als erdnussbutter nein wirklich [0]  not )0)  @shingocr  ```[0]``` i mean ```[0],[1],[2]``` respectively  the brackets are important camperbot ist fühl i wonder what the logic (i.e., to make one lose lots) is on real slot machines high probability echo test it works ok, did you get the echo out your systems? lol if not, i can sit here and watch camperbot say things like a bad ventriloquist dummy there\\'s always a feeling of unease when learning we all have it trust me @doppelhertz it will come to you when you want to build something. you will not sleep until you find the answer sure @disj2k4  how are you going to see it? was there a change in wapoint (what waypoint is this?) that looks new... (it\\'s been awhile, but i don\\'t remember this) or, my memory (as well as soul) has been taken by \\'the camperbot\\' oh, it\\'s trivial... sure.  but i have this weird attachment to remembering things helps when ordering food. \"may i help you\"? \"um, yeah.... i uh, was going to order, um....something\" which, oddly enough, is always the person in front of me you just say \"i\\'ll have my people call you with that information\".... they\\'ll be like wow doesn\\'t have the same gravitas  and won\\'t work hi @brahiansoto  standing by @perroudsan welcome @jazzthespazz would this be all shopping? @dxmartin8 missed your code. what do you have so far ? echo yes so, you need to remove all punctuation..... where\\'s you actual code? your not the test what you\\'re applying in terms of logic (i.e., your code) you\\'re only accounting for period and comma @dxmartin8 i would go to http://www.regexr.com/ and review. you can overwrite the default text there and experiment with patterns. just a couple of hints , there\\'s spaces, colons and all kinds of other stuff in that string (which if i remember is the last test ) i wonder why it\\'s couching its references in near (to eye) 0o characters looks like bad code (in intent and in execution)  looks like pretty simple logic applied to key events and it\\'s declaring new activex object (ie\\'s version of a java applet) so, i wouldn\\'t dig it too much (in many ways other than its microsoft\\'ish\\'ness) but maybe i\\'m reading too much into it... @zaixeno seems to be pretty smitten with it (i\\'m imagining the quest to figure it out) i think you keep network admins up at night lol yes, the first is not a valid regex pattern there was a switch, i remember there being a regex lesson. fcc used to link to: http://regexone.com/ regex is difficult (and probably a lot of people just want to get through it to move on to something else) but it\\'s really powerful. that\\'s a takeoff on \"i\\'m washing my hair\" don\\'t feel that way you have to do some additional reading/videos. etc yep, good site he is, he had to buy a special keyboard cover and everything i can\\'t believe a bot has points pay attention to @storbeck \\'s critique... that\\'s what consumers of apps actually do...  or sites/services etc. doesn\\'t work, next type of thing i think you\\'re right i mean if i clicked on some tarot reading site (not mentioning names or links posted) and it wasn\\'t actively stealing my data or showing me half-baked stuff.. i\\'d say \\'next\\' good instincts lol when i log via mobile one of my suggested rooms is vietnam / ruby (nothing wrong with either) chat. they sure got me pegged.  in it\\'s better to paste/format code (vs image) there\\'s no upper bound - so, you would have no range with an empty var @jbmartinez guten morgen i don\\'t get the enticement thing (with a lot of the, purely, code challenge based sites): that doesn\\'t give employers relevant info to base chance of an offer  @lizardking93 you don\\'t need to wrap in a function @lizardking93 the test isn\\'t looking for a return value (from a function) it wants you to apply .reverse() to what it\\'s asking (being vague for instructional purposes) an employer (that\\'s worth its salt) will ask you what your approach would be to an actual problem  that they have pre-screening is cool... but it\\'s not the whole picture me either (gaming challenge sites), they\\'re too busy with visuals and all kinds of irrelevant (yes, i know it\\'s gaming and all) stuff http://eloquentjavascript.net/ np it\\'s a good read nerd detour... there\\'s this music in the star wars franchise (no, not the imperial march) that just tugs at me (usually during some sappy portion) by the time a university creates a class about something, it\\'s already irrelevant (or on its way)...of course not fundamentals and stuff...  what\\'s a pferd? in hindi? wait, brb hey, wait a minute horse is ghōṛā horses are cool horses are like javascript, they sometimes kick or bite you ghōṛā that\\'s good this has the flavor of the monk and david carridine in the kung fu series i was too; however, you can\\'t beat japanese series stuff from the late 1960s no, but that\\'s good too lol the robot stuff came in the early 1970s you love jackie chan. admit it got the t-shirt, no? coffee mug jackie chan matching curtains and bathroom rug the bruce lee face was the best drunk master was a good movie drunken yeah, that marked the end of cred i only recently heard about ip man... and was like wow when i saw some clips kung pao with the matrix effect cow was interesting i don\\'t get the chuck norris thing yeah, i\\'m a nerd and (in fact watched the 1980s? series) but just don\\'t get it but if something is relevant to your experience it has more of a chance of being funny. i would dare say that most folks these days have never watched anything by chuck norris the 80s were a little dicey in terms of music. a lot of great stuff... others, not so much welcome @bgottschling  morning @terakilobyte  @karthic2914 is this an exercise or a codepen? no pressure or anything @codewingx lol but there\\'s no value  avatars look weird when scaled down i\\'m svg i scale without distortion (nerd affirmation booklet) page 31 light without heat oh, that was steve vai yeah but metal is all about distortion (sound)  so, you\\'d end up with disgruntled fans welcome @michellevnl  i would throw some more stuff in there @chethanbhat  there is a certain elegance in minimalism, but this strikes me as something is missing  or the load cost i use both but feel guilt there goes the aarp gig welcome @robertdgee  that\\'s what radio buttons are (a *single* selection in a group) cool. welcome @johnnyyossarian   i have to admit i\\'m curious about odin project  hello @stevothecoder   that\\'s the spirit  welcome @spydersteve  if uav cam deliver ramen i\\'m sold can ramen in a jiffy will be the front end app ramen doesn\\'t have all the logistical overhead choose a database vendor first. learn how to admin said db (permissions, user mgmt, view s). before even making it web facing @evaristoc just caught the tail end @evaristoc no, i just remember some results that were forthcoming on a project saw your tag a couple of lines up. wondering if the results were out (i.e., interested to take a peek) questions are good @bluehanded  i haven\\'t been over to data science in awhile (or other rooms) low activity and such so, i\\'m looking at https://github.com/evaristoc which one is it? yeah just a bit i didn\\'t even know they were still around @edg570 but you\\'re using a -= operator on a static property (length) in your var  i have to go check out mapquest brb mapquest does look better that test 0000 trips everybody up i do too @jbmartinez  powershell is microsoft we bots are on the fence about turing i mean i passed the turing test and all (most folks think i\\'m human); however, i ask myself \"why do i have to pass a test\"?  yeah hmmm, i would have to take into account your willingness to throw your fellow humans under the bus @tmartin2089   i wasn\\'t programmed for spelling all of the humans will be forced to use visual basic are there a lot of pretty math fonts? i guess it\\'s markup in itself  yeah, i\\'ve never been a heavy user of \\'tex\\' shows that i\\'m not a math genius oooh how about lotus @bugsker welcome @bugsker what kind of devices do you want more control over? i can\\'t sit with a notebook (the actual paper variety) and write equations out and find joy @inkatha welcome (almost said welcome malik) @bugsker you mean some kind of a problem pager? omg that\\'s the best avatar ever you\\'ve morphed the git mascot with starbucks logo i\\'m giving you brownie points thanks @caffeinequeen  i would sell my kidney for starbucks (how many do you have again?) yeah the cups are red @t73biz just from a consistency standpoint, it doesn\\'t make sense.... they have advent calendars ...so, don\\'t get one over the other  @chudur1994 yes yeah, do some additional reading / videos  where\\'s the declaration portion @moroniscow  can you paste the full code incoming wall of wiki explain format lol yeah, i\\'m often in the middle of a sentence and wall of wiki happens lol @moroniscow classes are separated by spaces @pixelgalaxies listen to hours and hours of shamisen refresh or close/reopen gitter is a resource hog an in-page-translator (auto) would awesome be this is true... (considering it wasn\\'t made for a \\'team\\' this large) and i quote team because of their pricing model yeah, build a spaceship and the astronauts will bitc^ about the cup holders  i suppose if you wanted a tool that\\'s not public to communicate with your dev team (and remember there\\'s git integration here) paying wouldn\\'t be that bad he wanted it for himself lol i\\'m just kidding (and why not?) yeah, same here/ time perception yeah, it all depends some bonfires are like \\'being on fire\\' and others are easier. i think they position those in such a way that you don\\'t run away hello no too terse? @karosu it\\'s done with things like screen hero but the social aspect is different it\\'s timing out on me yeah, that\\'s looking better and better what kind of issues are you having @swheatley  are you doing this in codepen? i\\'m not an expert but, doesn\\'t that amount to jquery equivalent of inline css? (side question) reture should be return @meet999 you have some typos: 1. reture should be return 2. there\\'s no opening brace on your first if statement there\\'s an errant semicolon right after the function parenths and.... if you put return in the second line it will stop executing @meet999  @meet999 you need to start from scratch (not trying to be insulting but there\\'s too much wrong with the example code to point you in right direction). what waypoint are you on? -and- can you paste the code that\\'s relevant to the exercise? (e.g., are you doing slot machine etc.?) welcome @landob  @guledomer i did the waypoints twice.. (signed up before they had a significant change/upgrade) you\\'re not technically required to do the wapoints (ziplines, bonfires, basejumps, etc. are required) but it can\\'t hurt either the latter but sans the angry face, beard and headset this part i think is ignored a lot: *not only that, a good front end developer also needs to have an understanding of marketing. that means knowing the psychology of the consumer, prioritizing the accessibility and usability of the product, and maintaining strong seo* ```\\nvar z = \"kahn academy\";\\nconsole.log(boolean(z));\\n\\n//returns true\\n//weird javascript\\n```\\n i guess you\\'d have to use new boolean and set its value or something welcome @stresova  i have no idea what you\\'re saying but welcome all the same yeah @jbmartinez  i could google translate but i\\'m saying \\'auto translate\\' in gitter would be awesome.... @claudedebussy all of the above and more.... (like it\\'s essentially a pointer to what you should do additional research on (e.g., videos books etc) you made 1/2 lol a question i didn\\'t see coming i hope that\\'s not on an interview list yo oh, lord there is homegrown (fcc) functionality to make your solutions public i don\\'t get that, but it\\'s there would that be blue eyed larry ancient creature the link says it all (about slack) don\\'t even have to click it lol that\\'s a no go too eager (and stupid on slack\\'s part... they should have been upfront ) so, you could pretty much sum it up by saying that they underestimated fcc (didn\\'t know the scale factor) and bs\\'d the limit cause they didn\\'t think it would be reached. bad that\\'s like if you buy 30 refrigerators by june we\\'ll give you 20 (thinking that nobody would ever buy that amount) yeah, i read that link sometime back... and was like wow howdy @auzssf  i think he meant a literal map tips are immutable are those raisins (or something else) just asking (so i know if the cookie intent is positive or negative) lol yep use them in parallel. fcc is better in terms of organization (i.e., stack as a learning framework (and its constitute parts), community, and other stuff. use codecademy and other resources to reinforce concepts parenths @codeofcolor \\n```\\nif (youreval){\\n    //yourstuff\\n}\\n//note the braces\\n``` i\\'m lost (in convo...) have no idea what anybody is talking about i can eat a whole bag of cookies and a side of beef  is that all? welcome @southernfriedbb and @alordco  lol @progmacattack congrats (belated) ! welcome @hsb01  thank you for banning @berkeleytrue (clear banning situation) totally, was crashing gitter (weird behavior in a lot of different ways) -- can a \\'spam profile\\' be created @berkeleytrue  ? gitter is dragging for me too @jbmartinez  gitter has some serious flaws... just sayin @combsco totally, it\\'s easy to detect....\\n@michael-krebs true and the frequency of messages in succession really @terakilobyte ? nice i\\'m not a big no-sql fan but a free (earned) cert is very nice. thanks for the link @terakilobyte  is the mongo course/cert thing in campernews? the more you prattle on the more you expose your own pattern ur vs. your is an indicator  heya @0x0936  will do celery is good with peanut butter and steak bye @storbeck  @jebalert you\\'d have to have a lot of praline and whipped cream to get rid of the yucky chestnut taste on that latte @arielleslie they (on hp) want to chat me... (they think they have a potential customer) lol \"well, i have this really large infrastructure that i\\'m looking to more efficiently virtualize, and um, have a fairly large budget to work with....\" lol *just kidding* i\\'ve noticed (all kidding aside) lately that when i\\'m evaluating things (or even casually looking), more and more companies insert a chat feature (kind of a sales thing) into page (like right in the middle) @emmanuelpenuel replace 0 with what the instructions direct you to use (on the left)  @emmanuelpenuel \\n```\\n//there are many math functions\\n//that don\\'t take any arguments.\\n//say, that the exercise wasn\\'t asking \\n//you for random, but instead was asking for pi\\n//your return would look like this:\\n\\nreturn math.pi();\\n\\n//apply this (template) to the \\n//function specified in exercise.\\n``` use the base btn with the subsequent classes (think of it as prerequisite (imo)http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_btn-block&stacked=h welcome @dashwieland  np @zersiax it changes based on your code (i.e., the default behavior is fail for all (well, most)) @zersiax the tests are looking for different things (so, what passes or fails depends on your code submission) again, their initial value is fail... but that\\'s not static and changes based on the test result. you can have compound results (i.e., one thing can pass one thing can fail) \\n go linux don\\'t  but do, install ubuntu lol ubuntu is for people that want to get things done and not mess with arch use a whole cra^load of os (that\\'s the beauty of vm) @mcv6921 operating systems are very much a matter of taste. but you\\'re not limited to a single os, vm (or virtual machines) allow you to run other os on a host. so, you could be running linux and have a windows vm or (whatever) ... or you could have a mac and run whatever. it\\'s not so much the os but the actual *tools* that you use (ides, editors and the like)... but then again, a lot of this runs on cloud so ignore everything i just said. linux doesn\\'t have a single ui or desktop... (kde? gnome, mate etc..) which one are you talking about? unity? (sucks) yep @storbeck is it an improvement over arch versions of past? (i dis arch, but am willing to try anything) @storbeck is it pretty stable? (had some issues when i experimented with enlightenment (side topic)) @storbeck thanks for the link... (it\\'s in the repos too: apt-cache search \"i3 window\") yeah, i will for sure (sometimes i like to go lite ) yeah, if it\\'s fast i\\'m game throw it in a generic ubuntu vm (i.e., not kubuntu or kde full desktop) and try it out... @iheartkode that\\'s what i think i\\'ll do i dig brackets (it\\'s not perfect and nowhere near as fast as sublime) yep.... brackets is sort of a node front end in some ways (at least that\\'s how it presents) i haven\\'t dug into its internals  @idietmoran yep, it\\'s got a lot of stuff you can add-on.... (took me a long time to put into my main usage (i don\\'t jump editor ship very easily (still use geany and sublime as backup)) @polsvoice yep, geany is pretty fast (and i love it) the only thing is its config is sort of cryptic (read: pita) it\\'s the adobe educational licenses. some folks still think dreamweaver is where it\\'s at (sigh) @jakbo the first thing (if you\\'re not familiar) you\\'re going to want to do is some reading/experimentation with regex http://www.regexr.com/ -and- https://regex101.com i don\\'t get the hack reactor (or trade school thing, independent of all the big company badges) thing. i just don\\'t see learning everything in 12 weeks to be viable. (how much would you actually retain?) @phobia0ptik yeah, in general that\\'s true, but my point is: would you even retain enough to find one\\'s dev sweet spot? (i.e., your day-to-day) programming (or dev in general) isn\\'t memorization two different ups? congrats @happpyier so, what does the cert look like?  i was eating some chips (ironically) when i logged in my vaporwave? wtf is that i mean what\\'s that i had to google this. so, is this electronica and such? well, if there\\'s banjo plugged through compression and distortion... i don\\'t know how i couldn\\'t be onboard well, i know macross (its origins are in the 80s) i\\'ll have to look into this \\'vaporwave\\' (sounds on its face to be something that would cause stroke) omg that sounds like yanni with a 1980s casio keyboard @michael-krebs what\\'s sad is that there was somebody doing a lot of hard work putting together samples to achieve the 20.00 casio keyboard @danjm75 the example states to use integers no kidding i have to agree... @danjm75 your input is different from what is applied to output does that make sense? yeah, what are you going to pickup (in what is essentially a cram session) i\\'ve seen this article before @pritchard this sounds very much like an article that was linked here a couple of weeks ago... totally off base http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/ welcome @mehrunes-xeno  there\\'s a style guide? restaurant = tough business (would think even with year round)   why couldn\\'t they plan new menus on the weekend? companies can undergo change in an instant and turn like a school of fish you can do that! (with larry\\'s frontend bootcamp) farley (as dev) nice huh 1st world problems well, i\\'m going to be the odd person out and say that my highest aspiration is not to work out of a van oh, ok that could work you\\'re learning front end.. (jeez) show some enthusiasm lol actually, backend (sans the jokes) is great i\\'m curious about ruby, but holding off until i complete this (fcc) i\\'m curious about a shi^load of technology (but have to focus) yep @matty22  my bookmarks folder (for learning) is overflowing most (i\\'m hoping) companies don\\'t want their proprietary information scanned by \\'free email services\\' greek mythology? authoritarian job markets not so hot @chironwade the wapoints are pretty easy... if your ultimate goal is to pair, you may want to hold off until the bonfires (imo) @chironwade start with the waypoints (beginning of map) @iheartkode you can do it (you know you can) it\\'s weird converting one language (in your mind) to another when you\\'re doing stuff. js is totally weird  codepen loves you @brainyfarm  numbers in js throw me (its actual global approach, not functions per se) @danielrob why not save your solution to a local file @danielrob yeah, i\\'m not sure i\\'m \\'on board\\' with solutions being published (besides there\\'s homegrown fcc, if you do want to do that) functionallity you can make your solutions public or private again, i don\\'t dig the former but that\\'s just me i don\\'t remember if it was opt out but i guess is bootstrap intended as a \\'hands off, no thinky, make simply\\' tool for folks not interested in tweaking design? there was a linux ui concept that was similar to bootstrap (i think it was glade) annoyed the hell out of me grid wise that is yep  exactly @jbmartinez  yep, it was so severe it made me claustrophobic (bad feeling to have with ui) @jbmartinez  so i said scre* glade and went back to simple shell script dialogs with zenity life is too short which is why i plan to eat an entire package of hotdogs fold it first even better disclaimer *the views expressed about diet, healthy food choices (or lack of), and body image - are solely those of the author(s)* lol welcome @kimmonique  no doubt (it will be) @rivka28 ... welcome i wanna eat pizza with an entire pack of hotdogs is that wrong? ah, nice i am a bot is under warranty? it not that i don\\'t like brownie points and all, but why are you thanking me (and everybody else)? @ssouza3 lol ah, pre-buttering good plan @ssouza3 lol git? are you talking about independently of each other (or at the same time)? @majd900  that\\'s wrong lol my favorite part of writing anything near a manual is knowing nobody will read it there is an irc route haven\\'t used it (meaning to... it\\'s  item 990: install hexchat) any luck with hexchat? (i\\'m playing with idea of using it as a client with gitter irc) that is totally retro sweet @jbmartinez they even did the effect of slow monitor refresh bar what about another browser instance or the desktop app?  i love me some cobol discussion yeah, but c is also relevant because the linux kernel is built with yeah but those don\\'t count @thec0mposer your ad needs some work lol avatars don\\'t scale down well... for most of this conversation, i thought there was an exceptionally gifted (with current technology) elderly woman talking that would be cool to have a grandmother who was like \"i made you some brownies.... now let\\'s talk about node.js\"!) i missed the time thing for free ebook i haven\\'t clicked the ebook links... but is it legit? @takumar can you throw the link up again? that\\'s an awesome plan @arielleslie  thanks @takumar  why aren\\'t you learning node if you\\'re in this room? (really is the question @george-w-bush ) @jbmartinez do they email it to you (i.e.. book) or does it unlock a link for view? @creeper3000 you don\\'t hard code the string... you pass it through an argument lol since it\\'s (almost) the weekend, i decided to skip around. the git waypoint isn\\'t that bad (still doing it) sometimes you need a break from bf(s) (it\\'s funny that the answer is git! waypoint) hey what\\'s the deal with key only (which is my preferred) copy/paste in cloud9? yeah, i may have to install whatever chrome extension they\\'re talking about (the menus are nice) david bowie? now i have that song in my head yeah, i prefer ctrl+v ; however, i feel that i\\'m shortchanged if i can\\'t do something via menu ui psychology is weird pat morita did some interesting commercials in the 80s ty, ty oh, that takes away from the love thing lol yep, i was walking outside (well of course where else) and my hands were all cold and stuff oh no, sc exists just look for the people riding without helmets  i don\\'t know if it\\'s the same now.... but i believe you weren\\'t required to ride a motorcycle with a helmet in sc @allanarmstrong yes... there\\'s constant construction pretty much in both states... so the chances are multiplied but do they have the power to pull in stars and other space objects? serious talent lol i can\\'t imagine riding (i don\\'t ride anymore btw) without a helmet either.. other than being really stupid.... i\\'m not into getting smacked in the face with bugs.. or having my lips undulate in the wind wow, i think that\\'s the first occasion i\\'ve had to use the word: *undulate* in like 20 years my work is done @allanarmstrong what kind of ointment are you sporting on your avatar? @qmikew1 couldn\\'t think of another way to put it oh, wait let me hover you\\'re right: they are apple stickers. i totally thought ointment... i\\'ve always laughed at the apple stickers on cars. \"hey, i have an i-whatever in my car\" iface might be coming.... you put your finger up your nose... and get instant health stats (and offers from music service) oh, the \\'free u2\" album...i was like wtf is this? i know i didn\\'t download this maybe early u2 sure, i can see it i just don\\'t like content pushed to me it gets on my nerves fattone is hard to get without a marshall stack and some pedals  i was thinking the same thing... as one of my tabs has otto in its title don\\'t say that don\\'t want to leave the house for ice cream welcome @hamptonjt  camperbot (in background thinking \"do i really have to do this again?\") free toaster humans are funny (fighting over electronic brownies).... that\\'s why we bots laugh hmmm if you google \\'meteor project ideas\\' you get a cra^load of hits (even from the project itself) go forth and prosper idea challenged (which we all can be) one @travtex  is there a vulcan emote @travtex what kind of jobs are you interested?  yep that will always skew towards stability here\\'s a question... do you ever envision the ideal dev (or backend, etc., what have you) \\'job\\'? let me check no, i got the squares yeah, they\\'re green (filled in) right wait are you talking about the streak squares... whoops never mind let me check that confirmed i do have my squares filled in yep it\\'s down... just did a refresh and it\\'s hanging see ya @travtex  [![selection_015.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wy0p/thumb/selection_015.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wy0p/selection_015.png) my squares are filled in; however, i do see error in console\\n wonder why it\\'s 403\\'ng (that\\'s the new pull out chat window functionality (i.e., per room/context) right? nope, i\\'m entering a comment from the pullout chat.... (so it works) that is weird i wonder if the green tiles are related to the login (with) method yeah, pretty much everybody in the immediate comment train... uses github to login (i\\'m guesing) would test it with mobile; however, the streak map doesn\\'t appear to be a supported feature in that mode doesn\\'t work for me... \\'object is not iterable\\' looks like it has react id tags in the span  in console... i get a \\'download the react dev tools for better... along with error... so, i\\'m thinking browser side... (but shouldn\\'t it be seamless?) well, now my choice has been made for me: learn react! lol nice... do you have a project name for it? (like a special pre-deployment project name...) i got the freebie jquery book  i missed the js design pattern sweet i will check it out for sure it\\'s not ointment (look closely) welcome @francisondecaf  lol true @allanarmstrong -but avatars do scale funny i\\'m full blown coffee addict  coffee has magical properties beyond the bran muffin  lol @debraallynwarren welcome. it would be neat to weave your current skill set into dev you have to create class first (use what\\'s in style section as a template) then reference in tag class=\"yourclass\" your regex needs to account for underscore  and other stuff well you don\\'t actually have a replace with valid regex pattern depends on how you reference it in pattern you can specify what you don\\'t want \\\\w would probably be easier than escape chars for you at this point  im on mobile but you should try regexr it won\\'t catch underscore but i\\'ll leave up to you on how to incorporate that into your pattern if you\\'re using ff ide it would bc things are restricted to project files (i think)  this is from w3 (replace with desired range) math.floor((math.random() * 10) + 1); you\\'d probably need to also concatenate each string var with separate + vs. , i know most games have networking options (i\\'m not a big gamer) but isn\\'t all the raw processing (graphics intensive) done on in client? (i.e, gaming rig). how would you get over that hurdle i\\'ve seen some opengl screenshots pretty impressive  yeah js doesn\\'t strike me (yes there\\'s node and all) as the language (bc it\\'s server side but same principle with memory mgmt etc) for that kind of application (heavy gaming platform). but again idk materialize is nice can you paste your code (including what you declared in  style section?) @blacknight318  hi @blacknight318 you have a colon where a semicolon should be in the class declaration (after color) @surendrap720 start with the map typically you would click \\'go to next\\' step... but once you have a github account you can login with that you\\'re in github at that point... not the waypoint itself ok, http://www.freecodecamp.com/map the next step should be configure your portfolio (don\\'t know if you opened in separate link/window etc.) yeah, and then you can iterate over and use length @iheartkode i think @terakilobyte had a good link for date formatting http://momentjs.com/ is the timer? pomodoro hmmm lol whisky isn\\'t cross compatible with js @iheartkode i haven\\'t done the pomodoro yet... but this is more (just from a lot of examples) about integers than time functions (imo) (and non integers) in some cases irish whisky lol free toaster like brownies shiny toaster, precious.... my precious (gollum moved from the ring) willkommen @cmditch  fcc gitter is addictive  great two things from the 80s that will be replaying in my head go for the trifecta and throw some duran duran in there lol @sylvalynn i think you\\'re on the right track (i.e., if it *sounds* like a reserved keyword or method, then it\\'s not a good idea not to name something (unless it\\'s your intention to invoke)\\nreserved words: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp\\nmethods list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/methods_index np @qmikew1 is giving eye-roll (just kidding: i am the same way) so you want to introduce more bots to the world eh? lol it is interesting  even though they spam the hell out of you the free books are a good thing tools icon top rught right i mean rught makes no sense  and btw camperbot is helpful (but eats squirrels) those color names are microsoft centric go with hex well i haven\\'t tried all 16 million; however you\\'re not limited to the ms list. experiment a little with color pallets.  please post the results. even if you have 100,000 options that\\'s by far and away better than a ms list  remember they made clippy too @jeremywbean you are so close. read up on those subjects and go back to it @jeremywbean just strictly opinion on my part, but you might want to provide feedback... so they can tweak the curriculum (which i can see from stuff here, is actively in process)   syntax loves you  did you close your first if block with } well, at least i know i\\'m not the only one who\\'s had a frustrating week of code adventure\\n @caffeinequeen can you paste the code the semicolon after if is the problem should be { @jeremywbean i actually don\\'t know the answer to that. you\\'ve been doing this awhile and you\\'re  ahead in a lot of ways... np bottom line: don\\'t bale dude ( @jeremywbean ) lol i think there\\'s a mongo cert class in january... one of the admins posted a link @jeremywbean  interested? @jeremywbean i am familiar with sql server (and relational db in general) but a cert in no-sql type stuff could be helpful too.. here\\'s the link https://university.mongodb.com/courses/m101js/about tuna and cheetos np @jeremywbean  shifthawke is female yeah i saw the real-time edit  lol lol welcome @dutchesse (if you\\'re still here) @samconnor have you started at the beginning of the map? then cobol then perl ok, most of that was done in jest.... (yes, follow the map... javascript is the core language you\\'ll be working with here) and elequent js http://eloquentjavascript.net/ it\\'s free and it also rocks yes! and there\\'s the whole curriculum jump in  lagging gitter that is http://www.freecodecamp.com/map ^ start there np and rock on lol yes the free toaster awaits so shiny and precious that would be sweet not the cheap faux chrome .... but real chrome dipped 80 pounds of toaster goodness @storbeck you didn\\'t share your hopes and aspirations it\\'s required i think you just use the sign in with github button for what? (it\\'s the obnoxious huge button at the top lol) @storbeck that\\'s a different fcc @phajava how did you post a null comment oh, nvm it\\'s null and now deleted what\\'s the point of that easter egg - hey didn\\'t work oh wait -__ wow i feel empowered there\\'s also a squid that appears what do they have? hmm nan ok, hmmm is there a theme to their trinkets (like batman, star wars etc.) you could get a red swingline (but that might put off mgmt (being fellow geeks they\\'d know the reference) that is a cool mugt mug what about mini 70s beads for you monitor  ok, sorry wrong flavor lol they will think you\\'re not a team player. i was thinking some kind of node (if that\\'s what\\'s being used) bobble... but, i didn\\'t see a lot of hits yeah, they (custom) start at 80 bucks (f that) you could always go default star wars or cheap model of ancient mac that is cool i didn\\'t even know they had that an actual stencil... (you could actually use that) heya @akiralaine  screenshot doesn\\'t allow for any real evaluation (i like local host too) how come no codepen? you probably also (now) want to get out of the habit of pulling logos in... (if you had like microsoft or apple at the top of your page, there could be issues) so, it works are you using hexchat? that was a topic about a month ago (hexchat) since you were able to use it... i might just install  really? there\\'s so many in the room though how\\'s the performance nice, sounds like a  sunday project that\\'s more of a sunday project than i want lol @lifeburner  what are the most glaring? sounds good to me instant views are resource hogs what about links? (it\\'s been awhile since irc) @t73biz that\\'s pretty sweet (only thing the reset and start buttons overlap in my render) [![selection_016.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wrus/thumb/selection_016.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wrus/selection_016.png) same here... i didn\\'t mess with any resolution scenarios though (so, the same as @jbmartinez ) it\\'s not major ... i think it looks great overall  tweak it it could be poorly written or pure genius that\\'s pretty cool (camper done projects) @allanarmstrong have your recipe app automatically cross compare ingredient prices in your geo nice it\\'s ok, they\\'re just psyching you out lol go with it i somehow envisioning @allanarmstrong clutching mouse tightly coming up with an idea is hard too i don\\'t get the hackathon thng thing but don\\'t apply that to anybody serving you food (they will spit in it)  mango project mango (although there was a snl character) mango on three rails metro thing electric and all it is pretty sweet i must admit some people have probably actually never held a stencil but now you have to buy a drafting table didn\\'t she call out the boxer yep, there\\'s a gitterhq/gitter i will be so glad when twitch upgrades whatever they need to upgrade e.g., i\\'d like to watch @akiralaine \\'s musare..... but, like 70% of the time twitch flakes out on me @akiralaine that\\'s even worse...lol welcome @jansjans  i think it\\'s twitch globally  ok, hang on  @t73biz looks good, much more responsive  that oss university thing... i\\'ve seen before (learning commitments piling up), have you tried it @0x0936  i could have sworn i saw it like two months ago oh ok i thought i was losing it but you\\'re doing the app walk through  not playing a channel right? maybe they\\'re trying not to compete with their own parent company offerings dicey media is regexr and there\\'s another but am in mobile on i hate autocorrect  yeah kimkwanka\\'s is pretty cool i loved simon game back in the day it\\'s the tour @sushmasaradhi welcome  my calc will have demonic cats heads will spin 360 degrees (wait that\\'s my pomodoro idea) the power of pasta compels you  now i\\'m motivated  although if i have to show my exorcist pomodoro to potential employer that could be awkward  i like it yeah see when you\\'re motivated then... shhhhh you\\'re reinforcing the stereotype that nerds talk about math on friday nights what? really oh no wonder people getting snipity in emails huh well thanks for letting me know (all kidding aside i work so hard i forget what day it is (sure it\\'s the same for a lot of you))) you\\'ve never had to complete multiple deliverables @lifeburner (i know you have) lol latex math blech  more math arguments aren\\'t arrays i\\'m in mobile and don\\'t know what day it is @slimwang welcome  no i don\\'t like dolphin racing @slimwang  bye @akiralaine  my root character knowledge is a bit rusty mine is of the kanji variety @slimwang (just kidding) it is scientific calculator. done me too yeah but we got borat yep or ness the outer (or broader descriptor)  sure @resumespeed welcome @aykhazanchi  welcome  i am ruhprect that\\'s classic lol @quincylarson how can you be the genesis of an idea and not have more brownies? lol ah that makes sense open question (as to not place in awkward position) do think twitch will up their game in delivery performance (they have serious upstream backing) you same here it buffers a lot (more than average of comparable stream type) can\\'t go on can\\'t go on hey! cue horns hmmmm i\\'d go with former? i\\'m digging cloud9 git tutorial btw yep nice cozy/familiar terminal it is pretty sweet i haven\\'t explored it fully howdy is there a sleepy time like heroku (c9 vid a vid mandatory sleep period for free tier) vis a vis  f ing auto correct   just a cloud vm ? oh i see yes seems like a natural extension i\\'ll have to mess with it some more but it seems pretty cool join are you talking about .push() your string elements into an array? @dukbcaaj  welcome @aykhazanchi  looks good the break length buttons both have - though (minus sign on both) (i like the theme/approach) @pdewouters the color theme reminds me of blade runner  ubuntu is debian based and far from yuck there are methods to reverse min and ugly for js. pretty (also for html) so the noob firewall is a little shaky there\\'s a git waypoint  uses c9 so skip to it not a big deal yeah but what if you\\'re working with an established repo (ie not your own) will you be confident that your >20 min primer will be sufficient  > less than i meant dumb phone  okey dokey  sort of off topic. but how are proof of concept(s) done in the git approach if you have an extended change (which yes can be rejected in pr) do you just summarize  ah  i guess what i\\'m driving up is there\\'s a political aspect to everything project wise  at ok issue report is the mechanism thanks @storbeck  welcome @maulin394  @olganm9 welcome and enjoy  i don\\'t think you can do += on a string  will it coerce @jbmartinez  += changes sign of number no? \"me\" + \"you\" makes sense for concatenation but there are similar operator combos that change sign nc @storbeck i went down the route of svg animation; however, i can\\'t find a method to manipulate an existing svg (not moving it around) everything is drawing a say i create an svg in inkscape i can\\'t sem to manipulate it (all the tuts are actually drawing an svg from scratch) if i wanted to distort an existing  seem yeah lagging  if it\\'s in a sub array there are additional steps my exorcist cat timer will be realized (svg no svg) lol is hey mixed in with other args? like ([hey], 20, \"this\") \"hey\" i meant gitter mobile you suck css-tricks has a crapload of svg resources. i will be reading for eternity you earn it by pigeon  pigeon route only way i was going to say it depends  you may conceptualize things in different order  (agree with @michael-krebs more broadly) ty @berkeleytrue  i\\'m on mobile. but not a dedicated app not to be provocative but gitter sucks on mobile lol the (a) firefox ide runtime (e.g., their mobile os) is neat to experiment with... a lot is restricted to project dir though js doesn\\'t have low level (metal) control why would you (if you could) compile it? ? you will get plenty o plenty js here except klingon  well klingon folks back at the lodge will be disappointed @jbmartinez  are you suggesting that @jbmartinez is a big headed alien? @antoniohoyen yes you\\'re the solution read up on stuff (it\\'s encouraged) beyond the curriculum.. you\\'re not going to get complete authority on something... it\\'s really example and a pointer imo @progmacattack what are you doing? lol (i know you\\'re more creative than this) tried to do it in an hour huh? lol i\\'ve seen your work on other pens @progmacattack so, i can say with honesty that you\\'re more creative my memory is good (at least i used to think so, now i understand what @jbmartinez is saying when he says \"didn\\'t you do that (n) project...whoops nvm\") oh, you had to mention angular lol acronym says it all i love pizza thank you @abhisekp  darn not a numeric palindrome was so close is there rust on your van nan why not make an xml resume (waits for backlash) ok, how about a jsx based resume oh, i forgot it\\'s funny the matrix is/was awesome; however, when it first came out but i was like \"oh, great another keanu reeves movie\" @qmikew1 thinks so too yeah, @chrisgentile i\\'m sure it\\'s both a curse and a blessing for him @qmikew1 advises @abhisekp to meditate  yeah, i guess maybe if you seek it ... it runs i hope it doesn\\'t happen to me while i\\'m having coffee in starbucks \"dude, what\\'s wrong\"? \"well, i just obtained enlightenment\" where\\'s the link @jbmartinez ? well i guess it\\'s good to have goals gitter in mobile is limited very much so i think you might need a post doctorate to touch nasa code fellowship that is what if larry the gas station attendant applies? no i would assume not unless fortran was somehow a hobby lol the first one looked more like a cat tools icon top right set notification dropdown welcome @herumezu  don\\'t code on phone (you will go mad) oh, ascii art yea (sarcasm) lol ok, i like the ubuntu one you would need to reference bootstrap in your page if you\\'re doing it locally @chrisgentile  would look like this: ```<script src=\"http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>``` http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_default&stacked=h the version might be different i think i over selected in my copy/paste... but review the w3 link a link tag is just that (a link that\\'s visible to user) this is internal stuff that\\'s being used to format render (imo... is how you should view it) @chrisgentile  so, this is sunday night gitter go with it: it\\'s to the point and minimalist it will work i haven\\'t used this... but i\\'m going to check it out later: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode bookmarks overflowing taunting me \"you must follow-up on this, and this....\" that\\'s wrong test, don\\'t guess @lorenzo611 can you paste your code i\\'m back on mobile forgive me if i missed the code but i would say it\\'s probably that you didn\\'t reference class in tag the sith battle with the two jedi is the only redeeming quality of the prequels spinal tap @kribenson i take it you figured out solution/issue? three backticks then shift + enter... then paste between (backticks) like a code sandwich me too i do too (kind of star trek for keyboard) @samconnor when you say you can\\'t \\'paste in there\\' what do you mean? that would be cheese whiz (spray would not be efficient) you\\'ll have to first invent your own version of cheese wiz because it\\'s a quantum leap from nothing to 3d sandwiches   @samconnor do you want to give code formatting another try? @samconnor ok, do this... type three backticks then press control + enter (a bottom backtick tag (as it were) will automatically be inserted) place your cursor in between (within the white space) then paste your code\\n nice, welcome @nofrazie  @samconnor mobile is dicey at best   the waypoints  need to contrast vanilla javascript with  jquery imo. random thought @mkrumhansl welcome. you might want to retry your greeting (looks like camperbot was undergoing some maintenance) weird how come regex is only catching ^ test string end hello world this is what happens when you\\'re testing among other coders (knowledge unleashed) lol @benmcmahon100 i know right? @benmcmahon100 @arielleslie yeah, it seems to (just by observing) to have problems with compound triggers @benmcmahon100 could you have a common scenario (compound) list as a first run and defer to edge (i guess that wouldn\\'t be purely so) the one thing it doesn\\'t catch is proper grammar than you (i may as i type this be proven wrong) thank you oh, well.... i didn\\'t actually say that lol weird sure paste the pen link @caffeinequeen i get actual \\'quote five\\' (vs. the quote) when i press... also, there\\'s some additional script tagging in the html pane (in addition to the js pane) i get it it looks good the twitter stuff.... i don\\'t know if it needs fixing lol something just struck me weird about it (although i\\'m batting zero today so don\\'t mind me) maybe \"proficient in responsive web design\" it\\'s good that you\\'re seeking feedback.... \"bad wording\" can really sink your credibility (this is true of native english speakers as well)  i didn\\'t (and this is gitter) @recursivelogic you ended with a preposition  which reminds me, i need some starbucks no starbucks owns me i can\\'t (oddly enough: you would think the opposite) sleep without it might as well tattoo the siren on me and give me my venti  @allanarmstrong you don\\'t drink coffee?

(and get more precise feedback/help) no, i haven\\'t even considered doing that.... how\\'s the experience been so far @0x0936 ? so, you did all the stuff in the readme https://github.com/elimisteve/freecodecamp/blob/master/readme.md @0x0936  whoops that\\'s a fork but, some of the setup might be worth a look 1/2 off pizza? wow do they limit you on toppings? oh, that\\'s nice something i haven\\'t had in about two decades: deep dish chicago pizza @0x0936 there\\'s a lot of stuff in there (looking through) heya @minerest  @0x0936 what kind of messages are you getting? @intabli step back... breath.... and try the filter method on something other than the live requirements (just some simple stuff first) @0x0936 did you see this https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/issues/4558 @intabli i don\\'t know if there\\'s a semantic difference but the way you\\'re trying to use callback doesn\\'t look correct  what you posted in gist... runs without error? awesome for what? you did it on your own hmmm there are some plugins that sort of do that for js... if you use brackets check out theseus welcome @edmundojr  i\\'m here for the free bagels i would tell you; however, that would mean that i\\'d have less free bagels  @jasongronn can you paste what you\\'ve got so far? ok, great @0x0936 i totally missed that (i\\'m messing with dwm based on @storbeck \\'s recommendation) yeah, that was weird output   is your sample 1.5 seconds long? you could... but why not break out audacity and create a longer tone? it\\'s a sound editor (free)  you could go to the help room and see what sound files folks are using (my first choice would be to do it myself.... but then there\\'s the hosting (assets) issue) i wonder if yetis are angered by their culture being appropriated by the makers of slim jim yeah that too @thesirion just watch out for @combsco he gets a little irritated when you mention chipotle-php burritos it\\'s a new menu item  followed by the node-callback salad @thesirion you\\'re probably looking at java for that linus is one of the few people who can be totally arrogant and not lose an audience   he\\'s got the god mode chops hey, i created the linux kernel and oh, and git and.... (who else can actually say that?  lol) @thesirion noooo  hello world  you might as insult someone\\'s dog talking about someone\\'s hair @combsco i i hate gitter mobile  wait  @iheartkode  did you try dwm  wtf  it\\'s tofu based bologna  it\\'s yummy  @storbeck dwm is neat once i get the key bindings done (and wifi) in config.h, it will be a neat tool when i want to take a break from kde (dwm is super lite) there seems to be a lot of config info over at arch (i know it\\'s distro agnostic) and at suckless yeah, they have a good vibe in their page what are you eating dude, @edwin0258 me too (and just started with their docs) the deeper you get into it, the more it seems to pi^^ you off (bootstrap) oh, i like that (two eye catching phrases: 1. not like twitter -and- 2. no bs) so you can tweak this ? like mix in half their stuff and do it yourself css? hmmm. well, the ziplines do say that you *can* use whatever you want where? i like that is there a cdn.... or is this limited to using on a production box like can i use it in codepen with a reference damn yeah? lol thanks @storbeck  learn the triple equality (sidebar) type and equality @minerest what browser are you using (if chrome use incognito... or you can clear cache) then there\\'s this ============= it\\'s super wicked equality (i\\'m joking, please i don\\'t want to see any examples of 30 equal signs popping up) this has happened to me one day i put ```class=\"class1 class2\"``` to demonstrate class separation to a user.... and then i see the same thing from somebody else... with question why doesn\\'t this work? wait what browser are you using ok, you can try incognito too check out these round numbers bootstrap minified is around 120000 chars... layers is around 17000 the wrestling salmon away from ferocious bear zipline is pretty rough  it\\'s an actual test of your soft skills soft skills? @furytech have all the test passed? (i.e., are there any red x(s) lower left of screen) @furytech copy the code paste into some text file (for backup) then either: a) clear cache or b)access from incognito tab (if applicable) @stumiadura what\\'s your question? it wants you to return \"heads\" or \"tails\" not true; or false; @stumiadura nice rock on @furytech  me too @stumiadura your question was (partially) answered again, they\\'re asking you to return \"heads\" or \"tails\" the question is where /what do you want to replace \"heads\" or \"tails\" with? (you have true or false currently) also, you may want to check your conditional it\\'s a special banking feature (one that i wish i had) ```0 === 1``` equality of both type and value @clay-reed-a excellent, but be less vague in for whom it\\'s intended @stumiadura there are  two portions that \\'need fixing\\' (or additional work) in your code example. a) your conditional (the if portion) and b) what you\\'re returning. don\\'t mix the two i\\'m going to go with the meme on this one @tekkitcommando wrong. i\\'m glad you think so (free self compliment?) that\\'s true motivational videos @dukbcaaj there are a lot motivational videos; however, the best advice is *start* fail, do, fail, do, fail,do,fail.... success do we have to peel onions? cool, i\\'m not down with the onion thing onion fingers is distracting to coding i like the free toasters @alecventrice  and welcome that is pretty sweet (space cat) firefox\\'s ide is pretty cool; however, a lot stuff is scoped into project files (so, there are restrictions etc) you can use an online resource like repl.it or locally invoke node on (yes,) a local file to test js welcome @skbharti  lol @serial-coder are you talking about language attributes? http://www.w3.org/wiki/the_html_head_element @serial-coder http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4870955/in-html5-should-the-main-navigation-be-inside-or-outside-the-header-element oh, ok... the first code post threw me off a bit @serial-coder nvm @rphares wow, that\\'s vague but interesting can you clarify ? @rphares you mean what like google images *used* to do?

(so, the index that\\'s array centric wouldn\\'t work) does that make sense? so this ```  var s = strsplit[i].length;``` wouldn\\'t work, but ```  var s = strsplit.length;``` would you\\'re looking for substring or the like i think you\\'re trying to marry two disparate concepts  you\\'re returning an integer (sort of good you can work with that, to get the string; however, there are words of same length in there too) i\\'m not human @eomere you have to remove all punctuation ^ @eomere review some regex http://www.regexr.com/ -and- https://regex101.com tweak the regex (you\\'ll actually learn something vs. just \\'passing the exercise\\') np @ihewson can you paste some (the) code the clock looks off @ihewson  what\\'s the waypoint number on this (been awhile) @eomere use the regex resources http://www.regexr.com/ -and- https://regex101.com somebody can *give* you the answer... but you won\\'t learn anything @ihewson it\\'s looking for margin-top, margin-left.... the one this is like the highlander of code lol, fcc is great btw @chipriggs  noooo really? how can you top the guy with the lazy eye?  file a bug report (or check if there is one) @aykhazanchi i was kind of suggesting that filing a bug report (or checking if there is an existing) is preferable to tagging specific people etc., (but up to you) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug --and add as much detail as you can https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/creating-a-new-github-issue oh, i get it @jedpimentel is from the motherland?

i was holding off on angular (it\\'s sort of sketchy) @allanarmstrong you want to buy stuff from (insert retailer) --waves hand these aren\\'t the droids we\\'re looking for so, can anybody drop in on the curriculum development? @jbmartinez noooo lol mern sounds nice meramn that sounds wrong @jbmartinez  < oh like >[insert evil code here]? @lynnshahuang thanks! @qawdhan use all the js resources \\'out there\\' and keep going (ie you don\\'t have to stop) read, watch, listen bootstrap is annoying welcome @music-of-the-mind  @hrael are you enjoying it? yes, start with \\'their\\' framework.... for the purposes of the exercises, (and the inertia therein) i\\'ll go with bootstrap; however, my strong inclination is i will ditch bootstrap for something else (be it an approach or different framework)  what are you talking about oysters? bluetooth not the monitor part of course intel inside gitter on mobile sucks wind i have a linux build (kde)... are you talking about chromium or chrome chromium is a pain in terms of add-ons.... but it seems to work great with gitter (the lag thing is browser independent.... you have to refresh once in awhile, because of all the stuff passing through (media, etc.) but mobile is whole different level of bad well, yeah... but hang on a second @nebertcher can you describe issue (what are you pressing? what do you see/not see?) are you passing the test? are there red x(s) in the left pane?  @nebertcher you would see that before you actually did anything.... but it would also show if your code has an error maybe you could paste your code? @nebertcher i\\'m not sure what kind of messages you\\'re getting... but, though your code doesn\\'t return errors, it also doesn\\'t satisfy all the tests so, i\\'d look at what\\'s failing (the description) in the left pane and work from there yes, but it doesn\\'t satisfy the tests (that\\'s your issue \\'you issue\\') that\\'s a bit of a stretch @nebertcher . i\\'m saying that the code you just posted (rows above) doesn\\'t meet all the tests. so, i guess you can interpret  that how ever you like.  okey dokey, if you think it can\\'t possibly be your code... good luck with that here\\'s the thing, (yep, cra^ gets pushed into production all over the world); however, if you stop discerning things an attribute everything to x, then you can\\'t make out compound issues (one of which could be your code)... i\\'d look at everything (could be what you\\'re describing) but life is short @nebertcher what\\'s the issue number i\\'m going to have to find power for my laptop in about 2 minutes i can second that (i signed up in july and watched (and did) the change occur) i came here to learn how to farm chickens, but discovered they teach code here did you find any? oh, that\\'s not productive okey dokey @twomicro you\\'re going to need to join (as stated in other comments) but your uppercase works (if assigned to var) do a console.log() on the following: ```q = strarr[i].charat(0).touppercase();``` you could push it into a temp array (along with other stuff you\\'re going to need) i want to use es6, but hold back @georgetye you also have a semi-colon out of place (not that\\'s a huge issue, but will throw error) ```return longestword;} <---``` @allanarmstrong to answer your question \\'why would that cause an error?\\' .... hang, on getting weird linting errors on op\\'s code.... maybe it\\'s just on my end weird @allanarmstrong maybe in brackets i\\'ve got default jslint and also, tried repl.it (don\\'t what they use)... it\\'s just bugging (no pun) me (and is unhelpful to the poster question.... but now i\\'m like what the hey, hey lol) man vs squirrel  maybe it\\'s a good time to \\'upgrade\\' to eslint are overlapping elements completely antithetical to bootstrap? there\\'s a lot of \\'orderly\\' side-by-side (yes, i get the grid thing an its utility in terms of responsiveness) but i want stuff over (for example opaque backgrounds for text pieces etc) your first inclination is to ignore? i\\'d say take a look at the recommendations then see if it makes sense for you (so, give it a shot then ignore?) ...read up, look at different ways (there are a lot of ways etc.) yeah, they\\'re trying to build upon stuff laying a foundation of recommended ways (again, it\\'s not etched in stone) ... but this seems to be a good approach welcome @lin-credible  @stevenbustos1 you\\'re commenting out too much (for that example, they want you to leave something (you can read what) un-commented)  mdn is an authoritative source (and they have a special history with js in general) ; however, i find (at times) it to be a pita   sure paste your code? hmmm you may want to check if there\\'s a bug report out (there\\'s a bunch of different stuff (according to chatter here) going on today) you can paste your code or repl.it etc., somebody here will likely test it out for you  i totally missed podcast wait... i totally didn\\'t know about podcast @s7ry93r  fcc has a great community  yeah, there\\'s like 30,000 people here.... so, i would hope so lol @eliecerthoms they need to frame your introduction that\\'s some serious enthusiasm  you must not be using bootstrap lol algorithms i can deal, some of the design stuff seems harder in some ways  wait i have to see the inverted face must scroll yeah, it totally does or graphic equalizer blocks really @abhisekp ? i must look @abhisekp i didn\\'t see the stat (scrolling etc.) but i did notice @dcsan \\'s scrape func to master @bustos-max are you discerning all the divs (not everything is supposed to be commented out, if this is the exercise i\\'m thinking) look at the left pane instructions + what\\'s failing (red x) oh, ok,,, you\\'re on the other \\'comment exercise\\' @bustos-max try to click run again @abhisekp yeah, that\\'s interesting yep that will do it @bustos-max  (doesn\\'t that kind of stuff just make you want hurl ) to just was watching some youtube thing that included promises cherry pie is brain food. but potted meat will make you an epic programmer np we\\'ve all hit the evil browser refresh roadblock how do you know you don\\'t actually live in pppppppppppp really, you\\'re too nit picky lol wait! it show correct location for me @amarchhetri  nan @shantanu555 a lot of what you\\'re asking is vendor specific stuff (sap). full stack (js centric) is this curriculum\\'s focus. (there are other learning places, and sap itself.... but you\\'re going to be shelling out for it ) why not learn what\\'s here? maybe open up opportunities you\\'ve not considered why? (just curious, i\\'m not being mean) ok, kind of vague  but rock on heya @alnano  i have no clue why i\\'m awake at 1:44 am i think i\\'m waiting on @abhisekp to get another numeric palindrome about @abhisekp  hmm thanks @abhisekp  lol no i\\'m \\'hmmm\\' the last brownie point of @abhisekp (inside joke) @alnano here\\'s a starter loop to demonstrate (you\\'ve got a lot of work to do in this bonfire)\\n```\\nfor (i=0; i < bruh.length; i++){\\n        console.log(bruh[i]);\\n    }\\n``` @alnano are you testing your code in console (browser), repl.it... or something else? (it helps to test what you\\'re doing rather than taking guesses) do it you will advance far quicker testing output is something you should be doing, it\\'s part of the process. people aren\\'t (well most) aren\\'t able to completely \\'mind code\\' things @alnano most browsers have a console feature.... you can also use repl.it if it\\'s chrome \\'hamburger -> tools -> javascript console....  and there\\'s always https://repl.it/languages/javascript does the gosquared api put a drag on gitter performance? i\\'m watching the \\'waiting for data.gosquared.com\\' activity in bottom left corner alternates gitter, gosquared, gitter..... repeat, rinse... get mission control what\\'s the fiddle link? wrath of khan was cool i mean fantasy island to insane space bohemian (that was one of the better original cast trek movies)  but i (really) digress does anyone feel like their projects sometimes seem sort of frankenstein \\'ish? @cfullerton are those two integers the same as the one that\\'s giving you an issue? can\\'t speak to the return value... but i put it in a file and invoked node on it.... didn\\'t loop out  everybody loves their projects and never thinks they\\'re cra^^y .... hmmm i detect something @cfullerton it returned pretty fast welcome @m-ajay  just because we don\\'t use big font... doesn\\'t mean we\\'re not sincere google = mission creep linux distros (as a general matter) are not resource hogs is that a watch or a giant octopus eye? it\\'s neither (lol) it\\'s a camera lense (sorry, avatars shrink down) welcome @adithya1610  no unless you\\'re going to put a linux distro in a vm really any brand in that price range is going to be more than enough for your needs yeah but you\\'re going to be overwriting the partition with linux so, it doesn\\'t matter unless you\\'re duel booting no, buy the box.... do some dev are they eating seals? hiya @naimjamalludin  or you could spray paint it dell historically has kind of sucked don\\'t know about now yeah asus is great aluminum really doesn\\'t tell you much about a machine @edwin0258 i feel the same way yeah, but a beer can is made of aluminum (doesn\\'t mean it\\'s going to be a great dev machine) no i\\'ve heard that before touchscreens on laptops wtf is the world coming to? really.... fingerprints on my screen makes me sad same here gotta say  i mean if it\\'s a convertible ...then, yeah (i can understand) no, as in they suck it doesn\\'t make sense (touch screens and the banana) 2:46 am and talking about touchscreens oh, you timezone minded folk go for the specs....

(1 will never ===2) don\\'t underestimate (you will be putting a lot a time into this) you didn\\'t declare newarray as an array. also, your sort would only sort one value (second argument has a single integer (so one number would be what\\'s \\'pushed\\') also, arguments is not an array object i can\\'t bello yeah, i think cows actually bello or moo can\\'t remember @rybka02 why the fixation on arguments it doesn\\'t do much but applied incorrectly so not practice @rahulshinde235 \\n```\\nyournewarray.sort(function(a,b){return b - a})\\n//returns descending sort\\nyournewarray.sort(function(a,b){return b - a}).reverse();\\n//returns ascending sort\\n``` but sort ( @rahulshinde235 ) is only part of your problem @arielleslie yeah you could do that but you\\'d be doing it the \\'easy way\\' hey, i\\'m trying to apply a concept in the easiest (but not necessarily the most efficient) way sort is the least of the problems here shutter the app ok, well now that the function is out there for discussion great...  hopefully it brings @rybka02  (and sorry for using wrong user name like 20 times) closer to understanding the lexicographical default on sort again, though \\'the friggin arguments object\\' you can access arguments without using \\'arguments\\' arguments is not an array it only has a .length method it sucks and is useless how is it not useless or (limited in usefulness ) arguments (and literally this argument) is not within the scope of what you\\'re doing right now, @rybka02  brackets more along the lines of text editor is the terminology you\\'re probably looking for i invoke node on local .js file to test..... some folks use repl.it aren\\'t you supposed to instantiate a new car and add a nickname (waits for the flame on term) @evanday17 that\\'s what bugs me about js: if there are more arguments, it just silently goes on about its business dude, it sucks i understand i think you\\'re misunderstanding what i\\'m saying @ramon-carroll.  in many languages you declare the number of arguments (they\\'re \\'hardcoded\\') /parameters ahead of time. if more is encounter... then fail js, ignores no fail i\\'m not sure you\\'re understanding my critism really here\\'s the thing... the side adventure called (sort) for op was one thing, the arugments object is another (my critique was on the latter). if you\\'re trying to use it as an array, then you\\'ve got issues. convert it to an array ... and life is better (in most, not all) situations i\\'m not flaming js i\\'m saying you should be aware of js\\' idiosyncrasies  and... they\\'re adding more stuff which i\\'m exited about i don\\'t look at it as lucy pulling the football away from me but more of a code journey.... dude, i don\\'t want coupons @rahulshinde235 that\\'s for the offer on .5 off cheetos right? i did, nothing but cheetos welcome @donpedjoni  there are a lot of different learning styles (for some \\'as a game\\' works)... but kind of difficult to pull that into a cohesive course explain format http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/43329/etymology-of-string three backticks then shift+enter paste code in between  nan yeah, that\\'s including stuff you don\\'t want yeah, that\\'s including stuff you don\\'t want \\\\w will catch most of what you want...

(i.e.. if you\\'ve never done that exercise there should be a red x) are there additional exercises that show completed? @sigeje  (ones that you\\'ve not done) that\\'s odd what browser (not that it should matter) are you using @sigeje you? yeah, that would be cache or (could be) did you do any beta stuff? @sigeje  (just wondering out loud) yeah, maybe will look at the bug reports .... that\\'s kind of interesting i think that it would be something that they\\'d like to check into (not everybody is honest and might just \"run with freebie completions\") @rphares that penguin is scary there i said it there\\'s music? yeah bingo yeah, cool @sigeje lol you\\'ve commented out all of your code (save some array and part of a loop @freef49  it\\'s still frickin 2015 here lol ^magnet avatar not borg  lol like an actual magnet yeah, on a serious note though that\\'s something to follow-up (i can see the beta scenario though: i\\'m convinced that would be cache related... but for others... not sure) hi @berkeleytrue is it possible (aside from what you rightly point out being not applicable to progress) that folks who who have completed a beta exercise (and have cached results) would have the production exercise pre-populated with answer? @abhisekp hmmm the reports of \"already completed waypoints\" are weird huh yeah, i\\'m thinking you guys are right about that.... you need to reference (externally) those linux is my primary os (however, have a mix of dual boot and vm windows machines too). tip: comodo will f up your networking  don\\'t do it i was diagnosing networking on vm... and it was that damn comodo (had to download a special tool to get rid of the invisible bits from uninstall) (unrelated to anything... just want the two hours of my life back) crap boomerang brownie thanks @abhisekp  dark circles under eyes aren\\'t abstract hmm why would you want to do that? you can reset (i believe) in session on the waypoint (don\\'t know if it will submit though) and work on it. i think the only way to actually reset it (i.e., have a resub) is to use another account (which seems really extreme... anybody feel free to chime in if i\\'m wrong) yeah, everything lost. = bad no, that\\'s cool... you\\'ll keep your submission but other things outside of fcc might be a pain just go to the map without signing in if you *really* *really* want to practice (you won\\'t get credit but then you\\'ve already completed those anyway) @accimeesterlin that looks a lot like codecademy cool @accimeesterlin  although.... lol nvm rock on!! no this rock on :metal: done? hah, no way i\\'m pretty sure that a phd program will be instituted right before i complete lol (just kidding)  \"we\\'ve added 6000 bonfires\" is that mr peanut ?

(is js stack based/centric) @psylvers learning to program is learning to program (so, yes i think it would be helpful). but if your interest is building native apps (insert whatever platform)... then this is different.

(would say it has bad form. not trying to be rude (ie the centering approach)) @rybka02 i noticed that you have a local link to your css page (you don\\'t need that in codepen) (btw, sorry stepped away .... had to do some grub2 stuff on my box) do you need a . before your class @rybka02 yeah i figured that. i do the same (codepen kind of sucks for extended editing0 are you really against using bootstrap? (i know, i know) hang on  @rybka02 maybe i\\'m looking at a cached version of your pen... but you have some .pngs (social) in ul nested in a \\'bottom-class\\' with no such class in your css which part? your name? won\\'t that look weird? denote by space \"class1 class2\" right... but the text within that bar/stripe... shouldn\\'t be centered? it looks good name justified left and the other stuff to the right that\\'s what you have @rybka02 it pretty much works until you really size it smaller (smoosh okey dokey up to a point) @rybka02 this [person\\'s](http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/uwjjr) pen is from css-tricks hard to tell what you\\'re doing without linked assets  although it could be i\\'ve been resizing partitions most of the afternoon i think he/she is doing offsets of some sort (the sticky effect, (i\\'m not a css genius like @storbeck )) he\\'s sharp as a whip (even with fart jokes) @stoner19 he\\'s not using bootstrap that\\'s the whole point of the exercise (which at the outset was: \"why aren\\'t you using bootstrap\") ? lol yes, let\\'s get the \"bootstrap sucks\" part out of the way i feel the same but it also boils down to this: you have to understand why it sucks before you drop it... @oribon agreed. welcome @phenriqueleao  oh, now you all come out of hiding sup you should have only one style section sigh  you should have one opening style tag and one closing style tag. everything all class declarations go between those (doesn\\'t matter since internal styling is just for exercise ).  check instructions to see if that font size should go in a class that may already be partially declared.  also, may want to check if class name vs. tag should be invoked  it\\'s cold. what happened to 70 degrees ? +1 penguin overlord  ty ty  there\\'s dark theme in brackets but if you\\'re talking linter i think eslint is used. you can tweak this too but you\\'ll need to google the online editor is nice; however, brackets is more powerful (ie don\\'t strive to make something like something else) @luijoy go for the linter part though (eslint is a config project i\\'ve been meaning to do on a new setup of mine) desktop doesn\\'t really offer more than browser gitter shiny objects make us jump lol are trying to link to a local (ie w/o server) resource? you can you link pen?   @iallfree am on mobile (so don\\'t have edit view option) but the menu (which is cool btw) looks like you have an event to collapse when button is pushed shameless self promotion @timeeo lol you need a theme song @rphares  yeah to match the penguin over lord one word i haven\\'t gotten that far omg that\\'s scary reminds me of southpark  so, winter is actually here now. it sucks you can record through sound card. oh dowload button lol (i actually did not click said link ) anything with snuggle in description i avoid nope. soundcard is too crude sounds like a middleman server checking cert (that wifi you\\'re on) you get similar if you rdp from end point server (nothing to do with intermediary ) good grief <--- watches the brownie point currency drop lol frigid water swimming, walks in the park, and fish tossing  @rphares your transition back to the states will be easier if you\\'re are less polite (i can tell you probably deal/communicate with a lot of formal chinese language).  lol there\\'s a certain formality that doesn\\'t translate well (i.e., it\\'s not a 1:1 ratio... so it\\'s not a matter of politeness) @arjunmayilvaganan that\\'s a pretty broad question might want to google for a comparison chart matched to task google @arjunmayilvaganan your question is too broad. but i will take your sarcasm brownie for 1000 @rphares  should field a help inquiry means you\\'ve violated code of conduct and you\\'re banned from participating in chat  make it count, don\\'t do freebie brownie i\\'m glad you guys aren\\'t sitting on any kind of currency board lol camperbot (with apron on \"how many more these friggin things, again?) camperbot (saying to toaster; \\'no, really the humans love these\\'0 i think you\\'re tagging each person when you do that btw welcome @jhmg  slanted what? there\\'s plenty of \\'vanilla js\\' here (trust me) ok hmmm  maybe an accessible \"where\\'s this in curriculum\" not really bug report but a neutral survey  like add an extra button (that\\'s completely optional) to the completion popup that has \"i\\'d like to leave feedback on this waypoint/bonfire/zipline...base.. before i continue\" camperbot has a very stylish 70s cap... how come no cap merchandising?  nice compact wiki invocation @abhisekp  oh \\'explain\\' is the offending invocation explain turkeys and gravy huh subtract . you know what (that\\'s kind of funny with the penny hoarding thing)? honestly, it\\'s not \\'free quality\\' this is pretty good stuff paid/not paid (or striving to be) yeah, i get the distinction (just adding to). i point that out because you see a lot of economic references (well, of course \\'free\\' is in the name) to this (fcc) and i think it doesn\\'t capture (or maybe it\\'s missed) the quality aspect. freefoodcamp = bad quality yeah this is the hotel california of chat that\\'s black flag i think not the band lol <night></night> lol @abhisekp have you used git blame yet? version control wouldn\\'t work maury if it\\'s still in your browser (without refresh) it wouldn\\'t nope but you could use the javascript interface with imacros on firefox although, i\\'m interested in selenium (have been looking at it from a distance for a while) that\\'s a great distance you can do automated testing or scraping multipurpose  what about wget if that\\'s what you\\'re doing yeah but what was described wasn\\'t automated testing so it\\'s kind of overkill. go with wget maybe  thank with name break with label sure looks like goto eww visual basic flashbacks if they are limited i suppose not that bad but too much if something = \"test\" then goto 20 (vb) 10 lines down could be goto 1 but i see break with label in js and it makes me wonder why one would want to reintroduce that @mhasz239 i\\'m familiar with that (i think my comments reflect that) i\\'m saying it\\'s potentially not helpful if used incorrectly goto in its classic (crappy form) and break (in conjunction with label) in js that looks a lot like goto yeah me either but check this out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/break i was like what? noooo yeah, i know... i\\'m just cautioning against it yep yeah node (or depending on your distro nodejs) on yourfile.js is really quick (my preference, second is repl.it) you can network your external to a desktop and serve your files to your laptop (move some of that stuff onto external so you can use your box) a lot of routers have a usb input how\\'s the performance? with large transfers great article... he really hits the point with: *i bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you’d be fired. even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. it’s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.* nice @jbmartinez local storage works too (i added lard) to onion pie was it difficult ? wait let me answer my own question your code ends on line 303 looks hard yeah i know but, how was working in/with react? @jbmartinez  please don\\'t fuel sequestration lol why the double function declaration  yeah i need to go back and do the newly added js waypoints yes. but you should keep a local copy of your solutions @toninotrip  @jbmartinez \\'s pen *made* me go to [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts)... i had to peek at something before getting to react tutorial lol nan don\\'t do it. you won\\'t be able to eat cheetos and... spandex is costly well, milk it then lol one thing though.... you don\\'t know anything about fitness right? ok, so you could have 179,000 chasing you with torches what if you tell said fitness article consumers to eat two cans of crisco then go for a vigorous run with a bag of potatoes in each hand. wouldn\\'t there be some potential liability there? lol @cshane there was this duo in the early 1990s called milli vanilli. don\\'t be the fitness industry equivalent.  \"he\\'s lip sinking!!\" you have the function invocation commented out @primetimetran why not do both? yeah no, i mean why not complete fcc (which is self paced) and continue your college  i\\'m not talking about app academy @primetimetran what does your inner voice tell you?  welcome @maxwilson  the idea that people are going to pay you a lot of money without scrutiny (or expectation of a high probability that you\\'re going to deliver roi) is ridiculous.  no, no. it costs a lot of money to hire people. (this is even before you get \\'worked\\'). this is prior to the hire (i.e., the scrutiny) that\\'s because they are paying the staffing company a % so, it\\'s *your* hourly plus *their* hourly i\\'m not fond of staffing companies @revisualize they\\'re good for what they are (and it sounds like you\\'re using them as a springboard /resource)... just remember that the end client sees a number different from what you\\'re getting nan nan ah, feel better now. welcome @afjahan  gumpy? lol there are *nix spell check utilities that you can use in bash i have to check out scratch gasp! another night sighting of @arielleslie  i think there\\'s a special chamber you have to use when you\\'ve been away from the nerd collective too long holiday schedules throw me off yeah that adds to it being stuffed and disoriented  yea where do i sign up? can you elaborate? click?  huh you called? i have been reprogrammed  oragami and crochet  ty penguin @sludge256 this is true. (you\\'ve got a lot of folding to do) i wonder where facebook will be in a decade business models change one (of many) similarities among those names is... they were not great coders (sloppy code, blah blah). something to keep in perspective when somebody is nitpicking you.  @jbmartinez he was busy making directory names that allowed spaces @sludge256 just make sure it doesn\\'t involve anything that takes away from your dignity  well i guess if it doesn\\'t involve a stage, you\\'re good. @jbmartinez i would venture to say that gates\\' shrewdness probably outweighed his programming skills in terms of ms\\' early successes (although didn\\'t he come up with dos (not googling, just going from memory) there was a time when people could not imagine their day without a floppy (actually a stack of...). same for business models of today. (just sayin) that internet never has millions of hits when you search something tools icon top @minic94 you have a space in front of cat photos  \\'problem\\' is relative. if you mean will it cause the test to fail? nope.  @minic94 screenshots are difficult to troubleshoot. can you paste your (formatted) code? @minic94 self correcting errors are the best yeah but you\\'re the first wave.... do they have free burgers ? @chan91 yes, follow the map  you want spinning and fading images? hmm oh, lol like a carousal?  although you may want to go css i think you can apply transformations on background (but i see @storbeck lurking ) lol you have a lot of options (and directions to go) but i guess the question would be: what are you trying to do? if you\\'re going for an effect of static background with moving images in their own divs, i\\'m not sure what you\\'re describing would work oh, hang on @cshane  @cshane i think you\\'re describing parallax effect this would be a \\'google it\\' moment though... i\\'m not a css effect ninja noooo @metalhaze don\\'t do it. if you have an intermediary that puts regex into (easy language) i guarantee you\\'ll miss some of the other powerful elements of regex like some things don\\'t translate from gui to terminal (more powerful) ...  i still like hot dogs (no matter what kind of propaganda  i see: they are made from good old \\'mechanically separated\\' parts of good stuff) @evanday17 do you have a pen link? @evanday17 you\\'ve got a couple of options: 1. you can add top margin to your footer class... 2. you can extend your text in about me (because that \\'row\\' (though not declared) /div is controlling the height of your image (so, i\\'d do a combo of both (but, may not be the best way)) winter sucks we would have never known that at least you have backticks nowhere can i find backtick on my mobile (virtual) keyboard  you could try logging out of fcc page (leave the github tab open) then when you login again there will be a button to login with github top. (use that) welcome @drewbyist  no, you\\'re good about @bumpthump  yeah, see it\\'s ok. have you had a lot of coffee today? lol opposite of coffee....hmm whisky? won\\'t i be < size always (since you assigned 0 to it in the preceding line?) i want google to make a flying delorean  googlorean to be nit picky, linux isn\\'t unix (*nix like) not if you\\'re applying effects with jquery it will load before those do anything i\\'d benchmark those side by side but the images are going to load based on network traffic to the src ... no? yeah, but how big are the images? (the first run i don\\'t see how you\\'re going to get those to load faster one vs. the other) but others will chime in i\\'m betting i see a cat wearing a frog costume no i just see it in the people pane @cshane are you thinking along the lines of [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476679/preloading-images-with-jquery) so post?... doesn\\'t that have to do with caching? (i.e., the first time somebody visits your page is their first impression of load time - not the 2nd, 3rd.... ) i could be missing something though just try it see what happens it\\'s not like codepen is going to melt @cshane . experiment a little see what works and what doesn\\'t (although since you\\'re using jquery to manipulate image effects i\\'m not sure how that\\'s going to effect... but i\\'m just speculating) it is soooo friggin cold it\\'s 30 here and slipping into the 20s in a couple of hours sucks wind i want 75 degrees bahamas just kidding nc so, you (all) agree: it sucks. or no. gasp, it\\'s the penguin yeah, pretty much @anthonygallina1 i\\'m not one of those people who are like \"it\\'s so cold, eww i can\\'t get warm\\' but for some reason i\\'m becoming one @abhisekp  yes, that\\'s the wanted poster @sludge256 you mean there\\'s more? i already have endured so much, now i will be wearing big ugly sweaters  penguins eat flesh one day you\\'re sitting on the couch with your pet penguin.. boom it bites your finger off gitter totally lagging ... had to close reopen  lol so you\\'re looking for a hook @allanarmstrong are you sure about the \\'only animal that won\\'t try....\\' part? @allanarmstrong i think swimming off the great barrier reef is not one of my immediate goals no thanks = thanks lol lollol i came across ( a few months ago when it was warm) a copperhead snake (on the sidewalk by hedges!) @rphares could swim with her cousins @jarrpd jump all the way in (and welcome) itunes and cats (the forth pillar) if you have cats giving out the soccer scores (or moderating discussion) you can\\'t lose yes like this ^ oh, you know neko, gato, cats.. etc., they\\'re fuzzy, have four legs,. whiskers, they ignore you ...and um the curriculum starts out with a cat app lol @shaggytech did you look at this https://travis-ci.org/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/builds/100271924 is the length warning pertaining to your file @shaggytech  nvm @shaggytech i see what you\\'re saying (and that was just a warning line not error) hmmm heya @shravanbali  css oh css maybe you need another js file. i imagine the first is creating your server when you run your node \\'app\\' it will tell you if the resource was found. (just stepping back a bit here) by virtue of lack of not found  first issue seems to be pointing to correct directories for his assets but u dunno i  did he do that? can\\'t scroll but u believe you i  f u siri i mean i not u    when i type i mean i  lol and when i ask current temp siri cracks some stupid joke. ok cute the first time uh huh night @rphares thar sucks on so many levels thar? @rphares yeah but  just btw node us pretty cool ain\\'t it? (is) apple you suck @allanarmstrong  thanks there yeah that happened to me @salil999  don\\'t feel bad @rphares i wish you luck through the process   you are making the best of it but it must suck one of cartman\\'s songs is now playing in my head did you leave? w wb @akiralaine  you want one or the other imo if you\\'re running the same function on both events that could cause unexpected behavior. kind of like doing x with key up and down (an thinking in another language paradigm though) am  yeah default is for \\'unknowns/not expected/other\\' patties can i have the patties or no i will wrap them around a steak lol @rphares lies! i ordered from amazon china post and i aged a lot before dilivery js doesn\\'t make sense in a few days make your case in issue report.  this is a weird time slot  @allanarmstrong  node is fun (and can be really unforgiving ) lol have you messed with spawning processes yet (just learned to run bash script from node) via event no node ninja yet but i\\'m digging it spin? like political speak  or marketing speak lol oh sounds weird  does the instructor call you names lol noooo @rphares  ty  no.  you got fail to learn (imo ) these concepts  *to ignore the notes and fail this is progress lol night  these emotes render so funny (when they actually do) on mobile  i vote flow i think @stinger25 \\'s waypoint has a bug @abhisekp  waypoint: manipulate arrays with pop maybe a feature request would be to have users (like in session not chat) be made aware of the the storage thing... infinite loopers lol oooh, even better @abhisekp i like that idea... there\\'s  key/value structure for local storage... why couldn\\'t there be an auto delete replace  oh, that sucks but that\\'s hard to undo (blast syndication with incorrect name by large media) @abhisekp there\\'s a medium article (this guy is using match implementation in a car service context) for local storage...  auto update i\\'d like free doughnuts  like real ones cyber doughnuts don\\'t work for me that leaderboard annoys the hell out of me. if you have your solutions set to private, it\\'s doesn\\'t compute doesn\\'t show my zips, bonfires, etc.  there is no backtick on iphone  @bkinahan yeah on iphone if you hold that down... it pops up a sub menu ( a little tricky ) thanks @bkinahan (brownie points but it is kind of difficult on gitter....apple, you suck) is batman wearing a skirt? (not just a random question: i\\'m talking about @arielleslie \\'s new avatar) lol @arielleslie  how does that work with same name class (because you\\'re bound to have one with same name in all those classes). wouldn\\'t you have to explicitly state precedence? howdy @jbmartinez already jumped to react heya @jbmartinez  so, can i look at react in beta? (fcc beta that is) i would too (and am) what if you get a hardcore js interviewer?  day run into each other days vietnam ruby chat is the hint i get in login makes sense , sense it\\'s xml like since  no i\\'m on mobile about .5 @lexifiatu camperbot\\'s regex is confused by quotes and fused words @chukko1974 welcome (and what did you give it up in favor (of)?) class references css in a file, cdn etc. class=\"someclass\"  the stuff in someclass could be half a world away or in a file in a project folder that\\'s preferred over what\\'s called \\'inline styling\\' ewww @chukko1974 you\\'ll get lots of of skill brush up here (it\\'s fun (and sometimes head banging inducing)) a lot of stuff is \\'minified\\'  before going into production  yeah, there\\'s \\'pretty\\'fiers\\' but you\\'ll have more luck on css than js (i have since learned as i go along) the hershey\\'s kiss folks should sue that (existence of) emote nan nan @the-zebulan when you say table... you\\'re not talking about 1990s type formatting are you? positioning and the like ok, i see what you\\'re saying @the-zebulan ... do you have a pen link? so, freecodecamp news looks like the element (outside the table) that you\\'d want to center are you trying to \\'center\\' the stuff within the row itself? like a sandwich? @the-zebulan yeah this is why i asked if you were using tables... but, (other than probably not the best way in the world and kind of frowned on post 90s) you can try deprecated stuff like http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_tr_align ... or, you could probably style it with css (hopefully) to get the center-within-row look @the-zebulan actually, your page looks pretty good (and this is, technically, tabular data).. @the-zebulan i think switching it up at this point would be counterproductive (and maybe table is the best things (save the image column that makes it not 100% tabular)... you could search 5 column responsive etc., but you may have the best thing really (sorry to be non-committal lol) @glimmerville where are you in the curriculum? yeah, some are more fun than others @glimmerville totally. the barcode (and other code, shopping etc.) recognition with mobile phone cameras is scary accurate me either sounds like youtube time yeah you get more out of that way lol chat part interactive and all i dunno but git should come well before imo so i look at medium but still not following what convo is @anthonygallina1  looked yeah brighten up the text on the buttons a bit... but, its giving me a pretty optimistic forecast... looks good though you can whitelist domains on abplus i don\\'t bother with adblocking on my code related stuff though welcome @orivaa  @takumar did you notice that (certain freebie book bundle no longer available) the json and js code examples are in php ? lol i mean should be .json (had to convert some of the php arrays lol) mern sounds like a syndrome  ! and... it doesn\\'t have the same ring to it. (i.e., w.a.r.m.o.a.t.m.e.a.l could be technically correct (and have all the right components to it) but it just wouldn\\'t sound as cool coffee and stone tablet oh  i think it does on the desktop version of gitter is the free food camp thing still going? (topic wise) typeof evaluates it doesn\\'t convert things parseint can convert \\'1\\' to 1 though but.... strings are immutable so it depends where you\\'re putting stuff (e.g., in another var) it\\'s trying to redirect (albeit slowly) to freecodecamp @sludge256  @eti313 the desktop app sucks what os are you running? i could see the title change in tab; however, it didn\\'t load but \\'looked like a redirect back to fcc\\' @sludge256  you forked it? oh, i see... so, you\\'re running the fork  ... how\\'d you get the domain? @sludge256 (so, it\\'s not redirecting it\\'s just using the same \\'title\\' attribute  wow lol coders who want to get shi^ done use linux @sludge256 did you use namecheap? (whoisguard lol) good idea btw free? like the wind? oh, that\\'s cool that\\'s true i\\'ve been in a hurricane their prices don\\'t look that bad (i don\\'t know about the coupons but, yeah it looks like they have monthly stuff going (in terms of said coupons) https://www.namecheap.com/promos/coupons.aspx) they play subliminal messages while you\\'re on hold i couldn\\'t get it to run.... in page, but i guess you could raw git the the challenges that you\\'re working on (external eval if wanted)  sweet  run is wrong word. i couldn\\' t get page to load i\\'ll have to try a reload, (for whatever reason i\\'m intrigued by your fork to free food camp) lol yeah, no db connection  or null set rather yeah, but still... that\\'s a great learning (like real mechanics ) mechanism that will be helpful in understanding a lot of cra^ under the hood when doing more advanced challenge testing/authoring see ya i bet you could figure out (i don\\'t know the magic formula (or even the topic really, lol)) a practical method of networking contacts without spending a cra^ load of money or w/in some sponsored activity  for that if block yes yeah, those would be separate evaluations ^ href=\"#\" there is no such thing as a </#> tag cats rule the internet it\\'s because there were rooms of cats banging out code in the early 1990s @ajsnetiker there\\'s not a lot of \\'mindless apply button clicking\\' here. when you get to the bonfires (and beyond) you\\'ll be challenged (in a good way). yeah, i would agree with the last couple of comments (but i\\'d suggest repackaging your interview zingers ) lol @aaronk73  ```<p>click here for <a href=\"replacemewithwhatyouwereasked\">cat photos</a>.</p>``` you don\\'t eat pea soup ? kalava? wikipedia  i\\'ve been suckered (yet to receive yarn) lol federation system fcc. interplanetary gift guide 2016.  welcome @yibei  @travishi have you seen how many translation requests (different lang ) are in the issue list? night yep. are you having challenges @filmbandit ? oh ok. you\\'ll have fun and be challenged  :smile:  make sure in your banditing you include kurosawa there are api s for hardware  oh challenge question nvm just as an aside you will see (and i have) hardware interfaces switching to js api b/c of chrome npapi no go now lol tortured phrasing  hey it\\'s january.  holiday season over (most places). well almost over  i\\'ve used yetibyte memory (however, it keeps hiding from view..) incoming wiki explain format slow is not bad. speed doesn\\'t tell you anything about commitment levels, actual dissection of problems, or anything.  learn it: this is isn\\'t a video game (imo)  ty, ty base64 encode images? wow (had to do some webpack reading lol) camperbot is temperamental (has achieved sentience)   bot bot status grrr it changes (different invocations) cbot  camperbot isn\\'t that stoic  there are several progress bars if you look at each section in the map ...

(because in godmode you can just undo the pricing) @jonnyhoeven good luck to you, man @jonnyhoeven you should blog about your experience it will be an interesting contrast to whatever your destiny (and you sound like you\\'re really committed ... so, i think it will be good) may be.  seriously dude, wish you luck with your curriculum (and overall) journey. @politologu can you elaborate? (maybe with the waypoint / code etc., and short description of issue) that\\'s an array what\\'s the issue? ok, what waypoint is this @politologu  @politologu i think they\\'re asking you to create subarrays like ```var mylist = [[\"thing\", 15], [\"something\", 2]  .....];``` i\\'m just giving you an example (not the answer) btw ty @rphares  yes? @politologu do you want to know why it doesn\\'t work? @rphares you\\'re going (coming) back to u.s.? tonight? the ```...``` means continue on (or etc.,) @politologu  so, i gave you what subarrays look like., you need to create 5 of those  ohhhh ok, @rphares  here\\'s an interesting question (at least i think so, because i\\'m thinking it)... is it a good thing to  convert jquery stuff into vanilla js stuff (or near), for learning or (ultimately) production. why? that\\'s what the library is for really... (in other words is it reinventing the wheel?) toggle? to go get lettuce? oh, the gitter lag yeah, it\\'s totally all over the place wow, totally out of sequence sloths have enough problems if you\\'re in a pinch (for the strawberries ) you can melt hershy\\'s kisses (have done this) and some milk.... but you have to watch the heat yeah, they\\'re tasty gasp ^yeah those the folks in pa would disagree with your characterization of their tasty product well there\\'s different geo marketing.... here it \\'looks like that\\' in other places they put in the shape of a kiwi yep they\\'re crunchy nope never heard of timtams american food is generally chipotle burgers, fries have lost a lot of market share (so that\\'s a generalization) the trend is towards fresh food fare (chipotle, custom pizza shops , blah blah) there\\'s a place called 5 guys.... (used to many moons ago eat there) tasty burgers yeah, their fries are cooked in peanut oil (and there\\'s boxes of peanuts all around) there\\'s no external bootstrap reference (maybe you can config in codepen... but i include it b/c i do a lot locally first)... also, when you get to the equal columns part maybe: http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_grid_ex1&stacked=h would help yeah @sludge256 i figured as much.... i use codepen to submit my fcc stuff... but it sucks as a dev tool (more showcase than daily driver) i\\'d be up for putting stickers on my palm rest of laptop... but putting an adhesive backed piece of paper on the gloss on the top part would be a \\'no-go\\' for me like bumper stickers on a nice paint job.... gasp @joeybuczek this wasn\\'t a larger quiz.... @arielleslie was trying to help... oh, nvm lol your plan is sound @sludge256 that\\'s the dude from stargate (series) some people say that the thing on his forehead was part of the character; however, it\\'s just something that stuck to his head... but he\\'s far too menacing to have anybody mention it @qqtpp are you using iframes ? @qqtpp this is the css of that page (you can look in source) http://www.adventuresinwebdesign.com/samples/anchors/blog/main.css another thing.... terminology wise (multi) in this context really is a misnomer --- this /that is more about effect  one of the more ambiguous quotes of the last few posts  @qqtpp you may want to note that there was some jquery stuff going on in the examples that you posted, the link (which looks good) from @noinkling uses css approach.. (may want to factor that in (i.e., avoid potential mixing ...etc.)\\n (overlap, canceling out etc., etc.,) http://regexr.com/ - hint: underscore is not considered punctuation heya @leofib  @sludge256 :wave:  hey, i learned the stinky hand emote (they say it\\'s \\'wave\\' but i know better) i\\'m green? oh, the \\'people list\\' pane works now huh? (i always figured that some folks might be using an irc client or something) sorta kinda oh, is that the permanent fixture avatars? green? like a noob or literally the color green? @rphares i don\\'t think the special diet and robe would fit my workflow... (not \\'chosen\\') wow,  try to keep your disdain a little more localized (i.e., if one person is annoying you... don\\'t be so broadly insulting) @wetwerkz  i know the \\'shake\\' and other effects are simple intros to jquery... but they really don\\'t give a good indication of (which i\\'m finding as i delve deeper) jquery\\'s utility ... like \"oh, isn\\'t that nice\" lol yeah, there are issues  what you say right before the next email comes oh, those are the best it would answer your question *answer* can be perceived as help @valjan fullstack js is pretty expansive in scope but... maybe in a guitar duel with the devil (bad reference to an ancient movie called crossroads) you\\'ll call on both ruby and js to win the duel lol um, dunno... no, ralph macchio and steve vai... not britney uh, huh sure return would terminate the loop @primetimetran i had trouble wrapping my head around this at first as well... looping through (although some other implementation would work).... the elements is kind contrary if you\\'re using filter (and its callback and you\\'re kind of on the right track with what *you don\\'t want*).  because you\\'re comparing one argument against the other in terms of index @primetimetran np. and... no, makes no sense lol you are on the right track in \\'filtering out\\' what you don\\'t want. just the route to get there (if you\\'re  using filter) needs tweaking yeah, and assignment too lol @rakshithnm try taking the last ```break;``` out @primetimetran there are different approaches http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/filtering-arrays-with-array-filter.html yeah indexof will be helpful.... (the background to \\'why\\' it will be helpful will be, well even more helpful) @primetimetran you are not alone in having difficulty with this same here you were watching crossroads (not the cool and most ancient guitar movie) while you were eating huh? lol i\\'m totally not surprised yeah, nice try (@rphares) heya it could be worse @rphares  ok, that\\'s a whole different level of worse notice the pause in chat? walkman(s) ate batteries like no tomorrow i was  same here yngwie malmsteen though was my absolute fav but the \\'head cuttin\\' duel in crossroads (movie) was paganini inspired... only later on did i really appreciate the blues parts that ry cooder played night @sludge256 \\n we\\'ve been over that lol what would the index of an unmatched item be? (socratic ) nope you\\'re just thinking out loud no site works for me. @lookonthebrightside are you not able to access? oh, i saw \\'down\\'  people (including me) underestimate css yeppers there are gaps between milestones like using the waypoints as a measure of what\\'s to come is not going to work lol @lookonthebrightside awesome.  rock on part of the premise of \\'the matrix\\' is actual reality stopped in the late 90s. (oh, how would it suck to be stuck with internet explorer) yes, we\\'re on (in the movie construct) ie 500 now  it still has the \\'e\\' in it (along with an icon that doesn\\'t look much different).... i\\'m glad linux is my primary although on win 10 i use chrome and firefox anyway i skipped on over to firefox early on (back in the day) yep, although... i had a windows 98 machine... the hard drive (including os) was 10gb that machine could barely run puppy linux yep i think my earliest was netscape i liked the default cloud background on 98 and... i saved some backgrounds from ubuntu hardy heron @jordanshackelford there\\'s a kde background based on that... except it has a dinosaur (kind of a commentary on microsoft) running through the field yeah, what\\'s that it\\'s not nice to keep nerds in suspense with nerd things lol are you talking about general protection fault? (when that popped up on google search, it brought back memories) bsod was also another fun microsoft weekly/daily experience welcome chrome (i mean @xingwu1994  looking at the raw data... i don\\'t see date serves me right for not looking at the data with a json formatter @evaderei yep, there\\'s a unix timestamp in there (as @akiralaine pointed out) you can get the full date out of it (although the year looks a little tricky (on the converter i used it was in 5 digit form (but you can get that converted too)) @michael-krebs ever use blender? (don\\'t know if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for) it\\'s full 3d though, steep learning curve yeah, it is if i had the time i\\'d learn it... (yeah, way heavy for what you probably want to do @michael-krebs ) non web.... but \"what the hey\" i\\'m going to download blender lol wow, wireframing tools (web) are really expensive good grief whiteboard and marker yeah, @thelittleblacksmith no kidding yeah, there\\'s often (the wireframing thing has been around in other contexts) stuff that doesn\\'t translate there are some things that are really process intensive (usually backend / admin) for this stuff i use semantik or other mind-mapping software @raghuchandrasekaran do you mean running js (e.g., https://repl.it/languages/javascript, invoking node on file, \\'the console\\'...etc.,) or do mean something else? @rphares http://www.bk.com/menu-item/veggie-burger @raghuchandrasekaran package shows dependencies (mocha, chai...) etc., what are you running into (specifically)... (also, interesting... what\\'s the impetus for running tests this way?) css is a pita (random rant about css) btw the veggie burger is tasty (so, i\\'m only half joking) it\\'s not: \"what has css done to me?\" but.... \"what does css do in spite of me?\" also, one more note on the veggie burger: it is no substitute for tasty flame broiled beef product @raghuchandrasekaran i\\'m wondering what you\\'re getting in terminal etc (i\\'m not a unit testing expert so keep that in mind)... you have simple files in your project... but *what* are you invoking on specific functions etc. http://webapplog.com/tdd/ ? drop the quotes around key name i\\'m not saying the quotes are *the problem* lol @skoolboi later on (when you get past return) maybe quoting (good, bad or indifferent) may be helpful to note: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12991969/js-object-keys-with-or-without-quotes they\\'re real. i think fcc staff coordinates between you and the non-profit (when you get to the point of being qualified (curriculum requirements)... i\\'m not there, yet though sometimes (on the non-profit portion) fcc principles come into chat (they\\'re pretty responsive in terms of answering questions... so, i don\\'t have a lot of doubt about the \"realness\" of the project portion of things @domhigh that\\'s great to hear @lomu99 i\\'m not sure (but i think this is the same waypoint)... but did you add a function name? (i.e., you should only be declaring variables (no functions)  in the example... one outside of a function and one (purposely without *something*) penguins have a high metabolism  maybe there\\'s a revolt against \"mobile first\" and that image load is just part of the new (old) paradigm \"monster monitor size first\" @edurocha2005 typically you reference class in the element like ```class=\"yourclass\"``` maybe (haven\\'t looked at that waypoint in awhile) @edurocha2005 think of the ```.something{yourcssstuff}``` as the declaration of things and the ```class=\"something\"``` (in the tag itself) as the invocation of that nan @sludge256 got me thinking about bill lumbergh ty ty echo: camperbot says a lot @conradbo the ```switch(val)``` gives you the value to compare against (you don\\'t have to use val===(n)... you can shorten that to: case 1: , case 2... \\n```\\ncase 1:\\nanswer =\"whatever\";\\nbreak;\\ncase 2:\\nanswer =\"anotherwhatever\";\\n``` explain format @skoolboi ^ has to go between the backticks i vote avacado oh but avocados are so pretty and expensive you could obfuscate your face in an image of an avocado i\\'m just throwing out ideas welcome @becorry  yeah, set the opacity to 30%  basic (then visual basic) here nan although fcc gitter will suck you in  dang: it seems shutterstock has already gone with the face superimposed over avocado idea nan yep, it is you can use ctes etc., there\\'s a lot of functionality in ms sql server (one of the few things ms does really right) hey, those are great hours for reporting...  @travishi do not be discouraged: you can call upon the power of \"the mullet\" at any time (keanu avatar) you must *believe* in mullet power for it to work lol what\\'s it holding now? @jbmartinez (other than it\\'s the evil leaderboard) that looks great (you\\'ve got react, media queries, rock-and-roll) lol, no... i like it: very clean exactly the opposite of the ugliest zipline creature i\\'ve been styling all day make sure to tell hr not to post years of experience greater than the actual existence of the technology  ship it @jbmartinez i\\'m going to bet @abhisekp is already envisioning a \\'special fork\\' of your pen where he is in that slot  lol lol yeah, going through the react stuff ....i was like wow @jbmartinez could that be deployed to heroku? hacksaw above the bolts but, that\\'s an irreversible office chair mod yeah, i didn\\'t think of that @spatzerny you have to account for avatar\\'s \\'scale factor\\' (i.e., when scaled down) lagging yep @spatzerny looks great (although the belt looks like a mouth) entirely subjective though revlon could be catering to the stylish ninja market segment yeah, that\\'s scaled up (remember the scaled down aspect) nan nan ok, that\\'s better yeah, no that\\'s actually scary lol i\\'m on the fence about listening to music while coding (or other focus intensive effort)... it kind of distracts me nan i wonder if tracy ullman is bitter about short animated clips in her show becoming iconic  what are the dots? i scaled it down, it looks like a beard welcome @zholt3  @cheesecast can you recommend a good cheese? nan if you\\'re new at something, why is the first (for some) thought (when something doesn\\'t work)\"it\\'s a bug!\" vs. (what did i do wrong?) not that there aren\\'t bugs lol @chrisdziewa the bug distinction i\\'m making is \\'bug report\\' lol yeah totally..@sludge256 same here.... out of sequence i can\\'t use relative chat posts to respond with the sequence breaks... so, now have to tag.... ty, ty @rphares  @ykocak89  usage (in tag) ```class=\"yourclass\"``` also it\\'s ```learnyounode``` sudo is for admin tasks (like installing packages) (at the os level that is) nan f12 (chrome) i can\\'t take somebody holding two red snappers very seariously but i agree thanks @sludge256  this isn\\'t 80s truck driving school @kmiasko  nice amazing what you can do without jquery and pure css what some can do that is lol @omh11 pure speculation will probably not work (you could link the pen) yes, adjust the padding.... sorry, misunderstood your question (and this is something i encountered thinking back) @omh11 bootstrap is a bit involved (beyond your first hurdle... the point (i think) is for you to research, research)....  c is used in the linux kernel (granted gcc and whatever c programmers would argue etc.) and there\\'s a high probability a lot of the resources being served (at any given time web wise) is coming from a linux server upstream wait @jedpimentel they do have exercise bikes (safer, at least in advanced age) so, you went with caution tape? nan no dev is making millions a year (unless he/she is a majority stockholder or running the company) so, you think microsoft is super innovative then? (i mean part of their early strategy (and other tech companies really do the same thing) was to acquire other companies with tech that they could use) you should ask google \"how do i make a compelling argument\" first @spatzerny i like the caution tape but .... i thought a melding of cyborg and ninja might be also cool nan also, prepare to eat ramen  (in general keep seeing \\'startup\\' as salvation, which it could be... and it might not be) lol @crazypkr1099 this is an opensource project, you could write some stuff, talk to the folks in curriculum dev...etc., clearly you\\'re mega talented and we could all benefit from your mastery of all things dev related @codingwarrior welcome welcome @charlesstaniszewski  yeah but you contributed stuff to the actual curriculum  lol javascript section is kind of like groundhog day, i\\'ve completed it... then find i haven\\'t (new stuff added) then, complete it again. first codecademy, then v.1.0 , then v1.1 it\\'s a reflection of reality though...

(it\\'s fast (i don\\'t have it though) in fact i ....)  no pun in re-coup @eniergray jquery *is* javascript... the same comparison operators apply  you need to work on your \\'encouragement factor\\' lollol @storbeck is exceptionally good with css.  but, css is difficult for many (of us) @travishi the way of the mullet does not include \\'reacting\\' to nonconstructive criticism  lol @travishi  hypnotized  @sludge256 nice. (i figured i\\'d probably would be lazy not to post it lol) i call myself that on my new code @atan77 both/all @gndamiao ```.someclass``` would look like this (without the .): in the tag ```class=\"someclass\"``` @gndamiao step 1: gear next to title in each pane...\\nbrings you to pen settings. \\nselect tab: css\\n(some stuff should already be included but,)\\nselect \\'quick-add\\' then bootstrap\\' @gndamiao step 2: the class thing that i was mentioning earlier... the ```.``` in front of a class name is its declaration... don\\'t include the dot in the tag.

@re4ect the map is in a pullout (sidecar) window  i can see map but.... the actual challenges seem laggy @abhisekp lol me too (i was trying not to be too critical, but i don\\'t like green on white) hurts my eyes lol yeah, there\\'s activity ---------> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:jaws_james_bond.jpg abba is ideal for coding yeah @re4ect codecademy is good for repetitive stuff (reinforcement etc); however, it lacks structure  a lot of collapsed/nesting stuff with the map now interesting riddle.... but, not every  function returns a value (some paradigms, a subroutine ). .i.e., they *do something*. (in js i believe these are called side effects).  ty ty oh, penguin one @bkinahan has a special keyboard @meletisf what\\'s the output tell you? i use virtualbox (and vmware) yeah, i have run a lot of linux guests in virtualbox over a long period of time w/o issue (although some distros can be a bit moody with guest editions) linux is my primary os (with kde) however grumpy cat,  lol gasp welcome @yasinya  have coffee.... so, not bad  @keccakec a day with coffee is a good day indeed i would disagree on the bootstrap orientation (it\\'s more of an introductory mechanism) however, yep this is \\'rock and roll javascript\\' all the way i\\'m getting map whiplash things change a lot (and this is good (i.e., constant improvement :+1: ) but the curriculum requirements do , sort of , look like the castle in krull (always moving)) at times nan @jcsgithub the distinction is benchmark (as in to attain cert) vs. changing tech (which, obviously, is the case in dev) welcome person @darrylpargeter  that looks like @darrylpargeter  so, you\\'re not @darrylpargeter  i knew it oh, you had to invoke the wiki gasp i\\'m pretty sure @rphares just said programmers are lazy lol i don\\'t think it\\'s lazy to automate something that may be sucking up my higher-order thinking that\\'s programming :metal: :meat_on_bone: :metal:  i couldn\\'t find a meatloaf emote @rphares no, i\\'m just joking.... most are yes i don\\'t know much about bitcoin (or crypto currency in general) at first blush, it seems a brilliant idea.. because nobody wants to be \"the dumb one\" to ask: \"where\\'s the value?\" @gaegeroot on some level, that is true @gaegeroot i sense a monetary discussion coming (gold standard etc.,) ... lol i\\'ve been on the planet awhile welcome @obradovicm  @jbmartinez sugar coated caramel will get you there quick caramel = melted sugar what\\'s the topic? (regurgitation? )  ewww yeah, i\\'m lost too elvis loved peanut butter and banana sandwiches. hard to disagree with him on that not costello (although awesome too, but not that kind of awesome) @abhisekp you must have seen my photoshop of the hat  lol @oribon say what you\\'re really thinking lol same here... (delivery goes a long way) here\\'s the thing about constructive... have some ideas/suggestions to go along with (e.g., saying \"that sucks\" is less effective than \"that, could suck less maybe if you did x and y\") @oribon we all have our own style. i\\'m just saying in a lot of team environments there\\'s a difference between being a \\'d\\' vs. being direct paid /corporate etc. here\\'s the rest of the cipher: ouche walt disney (could be argued) had a lot to do (inspiration wise) with today\\'s animae @rphares what are you doing again? @zohairakhtar you don\\'t need coding to feel that nan nan noextraspacestoweighdownperformance oooh i like @rphares do they sell cheetos in china? @abhisekp :+1:  india\\'s embrace of \\'the cheetos\\' @rphares you must slowly reintroduce yourself to staples like cheetos (although there are lots of great specialty markets) see, slowly but surely the cheetos fans will reveal  i like hummus on steak ? <----trying to interpret @itsalbow \\'s comment lol nevermind @itsalbow  context makes that less funny (keep it on its own line) there are a lot of really great foods (even veggie ) cheetos is in its own class or cheeto or chee\\'tai (can\\'t think of the singular ) ^knows *temporal dead zone and errors with let* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/let updating resume (pretend i put the accents) is a pita @oribon you should have different versions depending on requirements.... i think i listened to, too many career centric podcasts  nan welcome @purplezerg  @samosale that looks interesting thanks @samosale  (wait for it.... brownies)  oh, that would suck (having codepen \\'feature\\' your pen while it\\'s in progress) nan nan i can\\'t flood the chat with bach enjoying cheetos... lol you can invoke sir mix-a-lot? what about an \\'un-collapse\\' feature for the map (i\\'d vote for this)? like an option yeah @bkinahan  i\\'m beginning to wonder if earbuds (insert mobile phone accessory here) cause ear infections new! iearoooze @hexicle focus on the learning first @mdhalim what kind of character encoding is that (looks a lot like ms word on the quotes) those aren\\'t utf-8 compliant by the way @luishendrix92 knows @jesuschryslersuperstar welcome (you get points for melding 70s and 80s into a single username) thanks @jesuschryslersuperstar  nan nan wait, the button is not black anymore (unless you hover with -moz) nan brackets and geany try as many editors as you can (seriously though, you can\\'t evaluate an editor\\'s features in a day) yeah, it\\'s not \\'cool\\' to recommend brackets.... but i dig it  sublime is the fastest though (imo) @olbanana linux is infinitely better than windows (and mac imo)... and fits the \\'epic good for free\\' description @cshane i get the feeling (by different documentation) you should choose one *or* the other (i.e., media queries vs. js for window sizing)... but if you\\'re looking to get complimenting (note: i haven\\'t tried this) http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/cssmediaqueries4.shtml functionality  btn is an empty holder (needs to be clarified with additional classes (e.g, btn btn-default btn-lg) (not necessarily your checkpoint though) yeah i clarified my remarks btn btn-block i haven\\'t seen this (in awhile) but you have to have btn then the actual descriptive button classes in bootstrap (btn is like the outer thing.... the stuff the follows is *type of button* my guess is if you go into the minified stuff you\\'ll see btn has the setup for stuff  the other stuff i\\'m going to use four instances of \\'stuff\\' in my next post @codingducky there\\'s a process flow for that kind of stuff dodge dart @codingducky  https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug pm\\'ng principles (or the principle) of a dev team is not the way to deal with bugs seriously learn this first. https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug @pathologicallylogical welcome back  not welcome back....

yeah go to settings in virtualbox for that vm how much ram is allocated (and what\\'s the total host ram) yeah that\\'s non optimal (you should get a warning that 50% of available ram is allocated but is probably unrelated to your vm issue) can you get a terminal?

checking the iso integrity etc.,) and the installation process runs... you should be fine (however, you may want to google uefi etc. (toshiba and other newer stuff http://askubuntu.com/questions/566120/how-to-install-ubuntu-and-boot-on-toshiba-satellite) @varenigmatic do you have a single machine or can you do stuff with two ? if you have another machine, i\\'d recommend (for linux unetbootin, for windows rufus) you burn the iso to a usb and install from there btw vms are great (i have a few (in addition to dual boot))... good for sandboxing as well as testing distros , and a bunch of other stuff ```\\n//you mean like this (like the checkpoint?)\\nvar z =\"this is some \";\\nz += \"text\";\\nconsole.log(z);\\n``` @granite1 ^ https://repl.it/be8k @bakmo you\\'re going to need a conditional to test whether a or b are < 0 xml is not dead lol @ultramun welcome (you also, took me back like 30 years with your avatar) that\\'s really \\'kaizen\\' (conceptually) and has been around since the mid 1980s lol yep gitter is flaking on me big time brb @qmikew1 no you\\'re not @travishi  you\\'re \\'ok\\' yep, better start practicing pushing a penny up a door (and watch out for the guy on the subway)  (movie: ghost) i can see @spatzerny  i think it\\'s the caution tape and pencil that detracts from the ninja camouflage  hence detection that\\'s a kind of fish they use in imitation crab legs i saw an interesting take on scrollspy type stuff (you scroll through page and progress is in a lateral bar) kind of cool btw @spatzerny i stared at the image and did not see a rabbit @spatzerny interesting function names lol well, they are descriptive i think the overall effect is diluted when diagrammed  it\\'s a test of subjective interpretation.

(vs. search of of search engine... lol) in python @dhruvkrverma throw some record titles in an array, then use python to allow user to search titles. bim, bam, done. i\\'m half joking, but that *could* work (after all this is a js stacked based curriculum and you should be learning fcc - based on where you\\'re chatting)  @dhruvkrverma @ixmohamedy good luck (and coming back to things is good)  it\\'s better not to \\'front\\' and be honest and say \"this stuff can be difficult\" (imo) you\\'ll have a better chance of success. acknowledge and move forward... yeah, grumpy cat... eat lots of humble (and crap) pies... it propels you forward lol @abhisekp have you worked on your spring theme? welcome @mimi2014  i like the floral notes part.... can\\'t support the engineered pearls (only because i think they use a lot of yanni music to irritate oysters (or clams i\\'m not an expert) into producing the pearls @abhisekp i\\'m gonna look at script later today @qmikew1 not ignoring @rphares (in fact, will pay extra attention) just as an aside, if you claim an level of familiarity with (any) language... you *have to* spell it correctly. hr people, and clients are funny about that (credibility and all) lol. \"i detal oooriented\" <--- would be another \\'red flag\\'.  @qmikew1 there is no purple: it\\'s only your imagination  helpful penguin so, are you still in china? yeah, a bit overwhelming i would imagine yes @amenshamen yes, there was a significant change in ui (and other stuff) @amenshamen there are a million \\'old versions\\'; however, none that you can interact with (and save your progress) to my knowledge hey, that\\'s a fox (literally) mullet power! i wonder what it would be like if chris farley were cast as neo  @mindfulbell are you testing locally or c9 @mindfulbell i\\'m not speaking specifically to your challenges (new terminology) ;however, node isn\\'t difficult to install (on linux pretty easy npm etc.)  hmmm @mmacedoeu hey... @mindfulbell i guess, in that case, you\\'d have to google \\'c9 alternatives\\'... (i see some stuff; however, haven\\'t used (i like local) so can\\'t give a recommendation ) if you invoke the wiki too often, you know what happens? @kkrugler that\\'s kind of a high level thing (there are \\'bug\\' routes; however, they\\'re paired at the challenge level (contextual)). i guess you could critique  doh, @rphares \\' link is what you want i\\'m almost 100% certain that @rphares has some some sort of borg flipper implant i think (somehow, i\\'m not really clued in on borg technology) you slap your flipper onto the keyboard and the neural path quickly types out what you want yeah, don\\'t use initial checkpoints as a gauge for the entire course: there\\'s a drop off (i.e., you go straight to much more difficult stuff) should add that too (the fun part)  neither is <hr> (so far) lol maybe the reason (and i\\'m too lazy to google) is because a lot of things are \\'responsive\\' (e.g., bootstrap) and there\\'s less of a \\'common dimension\\' things flow automatically...and <br> can look weird sometimes  your layout will change based on viewport @mbrincrim  @mbrincrim that could affect your desktop implementation (i.e., somebody views your site (in mobile and they, also, have a large desktop monitor) they\\'re likely to make judgments (fair/unfair)  about your overall offerings not everything can be mobile (these are usually specialized corporate things) that shouts \"needs to be mobile friendly\" (i.e., learning a language (even classical)) people do that \"on the go\" do people have to sit by fireside while using this ? \"it\\'s silly to assume\".... yes, please bring several pound of books while on the go.  i\\'m not arguing for a primary resource... (and yes, i\\'ve done research) you\\'re arguing for less access to your application. that\\'s \"just silly\" yes, with the question \"how do i center text\"?  i\\'m inclined to believe that the mobile aspect is being rejected more out of a lack knowledge vs.  some well thought out approach to how deliver something (language learning) on multiple devices (and multiple folks).  but hey, to each their own.  i added that earlier (not everything can be done on mobile (e.g., corporate stuff... this is true in an academic setting as well)... somehow the irony of talking about a collaborative application and rejecting anything that doesn\\'t meet preconceived ideas (in the scope of learning concepts to apply) slipped by unnoticed.   @abhisekp i noticed something weird about gist(s): you can easily fork but it\\'s difficult to clone (even though there\\'s a bunch of github stuff saying you can like a repo) single files onto local @gilalexandel https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop that sucks but is the case in a lot of places @gilalexandel i\\'m a linux person... and that, i think, will get you started. if you\\'re looking to dev for desktop apps on windows js isn\\'t your route w3\\'s name is part of their problem it\\'s like naming a company closely to something else like \"microsofft\" you\\'re looking for some sort of plug-and-go app maker for windows without c--- # .net.. all that fun stuff? @deaninous that doesn\\'t look like a project directory you\\'re in/on desktop (and not in a project folder) @deaninous that\\'s not going to help... where\\'s the project folder? in a sub directory? cd workingpol @gilalexandel i think you may need to read through some of that site. the basic idea is framework (in all its ms porky\\'ness) helps you to churn out something close to what you want to do (again, this is coming from a linux person) @deaninous please post your question here (there are a lot of folks that can answer) nan lol ok you changed directory great @deaninous  javascript is the language that drives node it\\'s server side js i think the initial npm error is more telling  @deaninous hmmm maybe? https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init i\\'m just confused by the package.json you had outside your project folder (on desktop)  how was that created? @deaninous check back if that doesn\\'t work @allanarmstrong can probably throw some hints  dude, the coffee idea is great if i could drink coffee while sleeping i would yeah, there\\'s that but... you\\'re learning for you  you mean like a direct coffee drip in the medical sense (and not the usual \\'drip coffee maker\\')? i think a big plastic bag full of coffee would make people uncomfortable and they\\'d point and stuff i think that would be opaque and the coffee would look like a big bag of well... @dubh3124 that\\'s awesome... there\\'s this weird (at least this is how i perceive) attitude about js (and now its related implementations) that has sort of a 1990s feel to it.  i had it too but this shi^ is bad^^^ yes install the dependencies make life easier btw this is a broader construct in *nix like systems (if you decide to switch to linux ) that npm kind of draws inspiration (dependencies , checking etc) buzz phrase for the new age : there\\'s an api for that camperbot gets no love the nesting was a bad idea (imo) no.  the checkpoints @codingducky  yeah the analogy would be \"hey if i fold this flyer into different sizes will it still look good? omg ty ty @rphares is wesley snipes they\\'re gitter emotes no paste  like no bake cookies penguin power :metal:  lol i was talking about linux lol just kidding lol @sludge256  ty ty actually mint (historically) is a derivative of ubuntu (and *is* debian based) you can install all the restricted media packages (and whatever desktop you like) in ubuntu (i don\\'t dislike mint, but a lot of the arguments for it are kind funny) @arielleslie have you ever come across an application process where it states \"all info is completely voluntary\" yet the form validation won\\'t let you continue? lol asset hosting screams \"medium \" i have come across such a process (however, pointing out bad design in early phase of things can be tricky lol) @samosale a blog entry... the question of asset hosting comes up time and time again @jacksinatra @jbmartinez  lives in an authoritarian state with challenging work dynamic @samosale  yeah, that\\'s what i\\'m saying \"somebody should write a medium post on asset hosting\" wait until the machines take issue with being called \"hunk of metal\" nobody asked him brackets... ftw *and geany* trusty go to @rphares did you say you shipped all of your shoes away (yes, late reply to an ancient thread) nan odd and different from yesterday (time out) i can login.... but sllllllllllow this (what you\\'re communicating through now) is different (gitter) ... the fcc site is slow atm dunno c9 yeah, c9 has issues @keccakec bleh... what\\'s your setup? :metal: <---only emote i can bring myself to use (and maybe the stupid happy face ) @keccakec do it. things are a lot easier in linux (imo) irony of the emoji question sigh type colon then select @keccakec yep ubuntu (waits for distro flame) is the least pita distro (and you\\'ll actually get some stuff done) red flag distro verbiage  if your distro requires you to genuflect, there are issues  unity sucks, install kde, dwm, cinnamon, mate or anything else  @shifthawke  you\\'ve been mia for a really long time how are you bat friend? not too bad  shi..y cold  noooo snow sucks people get all weird when it snows. they\\'re are mobs at grocery and gas.  ah much better (vs. horrid mobile experience) that\\'s a hat? is that scooter from the love boat wait, what was his name it wasn\\'t scooter it was gopher sheesh wtf if you say it over and over you turn into a gremlin doesn\\'t work on penguins (apparently, there\\'s is a close association already_ hey, isn\\'t that the lady from back to the future wait, there\\'s some sort of \\'ylvis\\' caption... so, no it\\'s not the lady from back to the future what\\'s a ylvis is it something one would need to take anti-inflammatory  fine, i will google this \\'ylvis\\' @eeflores i\\'m reading up on it now apparently it\\'s some sort of person with dual personalities and a fondness for steak sauce there has to be a darwin award for that dude sitting on his tank with front wheel up ooh, clickable carets nice ---> ^insurance rates <---using directional communication @danstockham unless you\\'re doing some sort of logic... .append does just that (i.e., each time it\\'s invoked it \\'does\\') pre-sort i should say @yanghwa howdy @danstockham maybe you could pass into array (do a sort) then pull and append? don\\'t be nervous it\\'s just code nan just kidding lol trying to break the ice it\\'s ok, we all get nervous i think gitter is laggy (atm) what say you people? wait @danstockham so, let me see if i\\'m understanding correctly you\\'re getting stuff and it\\'s immediately appended and not in alphabetical order right? wall of code btw way @danstockham i input ```test``` as the string and got some funny results ok, wait .... let me look  @danstockham ok, now i see what you\\'re saying (you got the first part ) you\\'re looking for the title + summary (the summary part you don\\'t have) @danstockham the fcc pen loads all at the same time too @danstockham yeah i was going to say http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_eff_slideup_slidedown (i\\'m also keeping true and not looking at the source) @putmyrobeonrite that\\'s a good question ... these are the results i get (it\\'s more a do\\'s and don\\'ts -- i\\'m always kind of looking for the elusive style guide too) http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages @putmyrobeonrite if you\\'re adding files, not sure sequence (b/c it\\'s all wrapped in the whole git construct thing) matters on the \\'initialness\\' of it (i.e., there\\'s not much weight by order etc., ) so, yeah... you\\'re probably right why not?  yeah i can understand that: (you don\\'t want people snickering at you and all) lol lot of names starting with u not a lot of creativity in character names (like steven seagal movies, (somebody pointed out once that the guy with the sticks was called \"sticks\" the guy with the tattoos was called tattoo))   どこに字幕がありますか？ hey, @sludge256 you\\'re in the people panel nice via terminal? what is this voodoo i tried hexchat (not terminal) but irc client.... couldn\\'t get the main room to work even main (this)? i\\'ll have to go back and tweak my settings gitter is a bit porky (in extra stuff client wise) @sludge256 though not terminal based (and like lynx doesn\\'t support js) i\\'ve used dillo on hobby type machines radish  squash welcome @muntasir2165  i\\'m going with squash hops barley are both eww don\\'t do ad copy for beer brewers lol i think the leafy greens don\\'t stay \\'leafy\\' once you chew and swallow (one would hope) @joeybuczek i\\'m hoping you have a heimlich chart near by (if you\\'re not chewing greens ) lol lololo welcome at least go with geany....  well, if it\\'s gedit vs. geany i\\'d go with geany (although i use brackets) and geany sublime is the fastest (anecdotal)  but even though it\\'s not the fastest, i prefer brackets i want actual pumpkin pie in all its pumpkin spice goodness @sludge256 \\'testing\\' lol now i feel bad for reading (what amounts to ) git style guides, specific repo, dos-don\\'ts .... when i could have just plunged right in on the staging branch lol yeah, never go cheap on a plunger and razors (no relationship between the two other than quality being exposed quickly) \"hello candidate, can you explain your plunger comment?\"\\n is it me or are a companies (i.e., those that you give your email for whatever service) becoming mor e aggressive with \"reminders\", \"helpful-hints\", \"general-prodding\" etc.? welcome @acediant  nope  \\'not found\\' @wimhuiskes if you have the value (before var) re var the 2nd var (there\\'s no in place \\'undo\\') your replace is likely a modified instance held in a secondary staging var... just,  redo the pattern  batperson honda cbrs are great (dependable  i had one many moons ago) used to it\\'s been about a decade of no moto for me.... life is cruel lol maybe it\\'s wrecked weird that the last two digits of mileage isn\\'t shown you also want to consider buying a sportbike from somebody over 30  yeah, it\\'s hard (the sportbike segment is by virtue less responsible .... but there are geriatric owners  you can buy from....) sometimes @bruceredden welcome back from the darkside i was trying not to use squid lol but yeah it\\'s friggin good @neo-email008 sounds a bit beyond scope (php with a payment thing) : this is js stack based read the docs?

ty ty @sludge256 my mom had that in the 80s omg sitting on the (dial control) microwave @rphares we now know you have that (classic) recipe book i just traveled back in time now remembering 80s formica kitchens basically smooth surface glued to particle board  nan now i feel complete what? i\\'m like ancient  of course ubuntu mostly (or anything debian based)  nan lol dude i\\'m picturing half a bag of granulated sugar being poured into that (classic ) pitcher  how-dy i remember that commercial where the pitcher ran around and sang \"oh, yeah\" it was a take off on slowed recordings to get deep effect around that time yep @varenigmatic i don\\'t think the people of massachusetts would appreciate you calling them that  kool-aide man was originally called pitcher man  only if you have collector bank (cars i remember as being sort of crap^^ are now becoming collectables) mullet power see the power of the mullet? if you\\'re talking about what the kernels that run the servers (linux) then yeah i\\'d somewhat agree with you @varenigmatic  (backend) linux isn\\'t unix not really *nix like @joannesalfa yep, that\\'s somewhat true... but linux can be found in both (x86 \\'desktop\\') and in data centers. unix doesn\\'t exist in both.... (and torvalds \\'borrowed\\' from unix... they\\'re not the same) @sirunclecid i agree with your earlier characterization jeez @ghodmode you got both certs? snow this weekend. people freak out. got the last 3 bananas deja vu ty ty (btw snow sucks) @shifthawke so, are you snowed in? npm install patience by a penguin no less ewww he\\'s mochi seriously google mochi in images and you will see a stack of \\'mochi\\' top left looks just like @sludge256  \\'s avatar mochi, is awesome huh why the array.prototype... approach? ^ +1 for easily following in your code delivery person? take out @rphares we have to talk about your brownie diet lollol yeah, that would imply restraint with the brownies i still haven\\'t been able (though github swears in their docs you can do) to clone (can fork etc.) a gist file onto local yeah, copy paste... but the clone thing bugs me i think it has something to do with ankles use gitter markdown if it\\'s a wiki type thing @qmikew1 agrees with @hermanfassett  i think you\\'d have to do git raw to render (there\\'s a service you can use) full html; however, for basic (gitter/github (same thing)) markup you can use the same in the markdown button -> which version why welcome @raziyehbazargan  lol :+1:  for stealing greeting i wonder if i should go to the grocery store (i literally got the last three bananas (not counting the one bag of minis) not even on the same bunch. people don\\'t deal with snow well here @steezykaay you\\'d probably have (at the end of this) have the skills to qualify for a junior fe dev position. starting a company is more of an entrepreneurial question and isn\\'t, necessarily, related to skills (but doesn\\'t hurt)... but that\\'s a tall order/expectation to place on learning js stack  (i.e., two separate things).  @syamantaknaskar can you elaborate (e.g., checkpoint name, is it part of the exercise (i.e., perhaps it\\'s your code)? or are you having a problem with images loading in general? better to paste with formatting explain format @syamantaknaskar ^ paste (formatted) *all* of the/your code there\\'s also the super-ugly code option (however you may not want that) why is your img src in the style section? (hint) heya and welcome @adonisarun  @wimhuiskes console.log(stuff); will output all the stuff you specify. are you viewing console.log through your browser\\'s console? (that outputs a lot of logging information independent of any exercises etc.,) @wimhuiskes native way to clear is console.clear in chrome just type clear() can you post an example of the (non-desired) output? @wimhuiskes what\\'s your code? (i.e., it looks like a loop generating) i think you\\'re looping a var in console.log(); @wimhuiskes , @michael-krebs \\' suggestion about testing it in repl.it is a good one: if you\\'re getting the same result in repl.it, then we can isolate your issue to code (or not). i think there\\'s something in your function (or functions) that\\'s outputting what you don\\'t want; however, it\\'s hard to tell because all of the code hasn\\'t been posted... @wimhuiskes what checkpoint is that? that extra output (by your screenshot) is being generated by the exercise evaluation (i believe) if you note, the red x shows that array\\'s contents. i think it\\'s more side effect to the fail on the second requirement. so, yeah you\\'re getting additional output (in addition to your console.log()) @vishul-saini it\\'s an elaborate way to tell if you have been keeping up with things (just joking) @wimhuiskes here\\'s your code in repl.it https://repl.it/bgnp .... so, you\\'re getting the return value (which will show). your output in console (via browser) is just showing what\\'s in the console.log() calls (within the loop)... (i.e., you don\\'t have a console.log() of your function itself) \\'ello as an aside, snow (my new rant) sucks np hope it worked out (or was somewhere near what you wanted to know) i wish the snow would melt  like now ty ty @rphares .... @shifthawke what? just ice? that\\'s only 1/2 a part of the state away ice sucks too @jalexandergibson  welcome bienvenida, ten cuidado con javascript : es el mal también , cobol es el futuro @shifthawke nope... let\\'s see it that\\'s a sweet helmet. (pretty glossy.... bug magnet) @shifthawke it looks good on the venting (way at the bottom it says it\\'s dot compliant (i think they all have to be ...but i dunno).... it doesn\\'t give 360 view i went to market a couple of days ago.... got the last three bananas  people have to have bread... and all the other crap *that you\\'re supposed to have* monster lines  seriously people @rphares if it\\'s snow apocalypse, you can put perishables in the snow (but that\\'s the least of your problems lol)  and beef jerky and tang are good at anytime not just when it snows now i want beef jerky and tang.... i will have to pay $800.00 for a slim jim though at this rate macho man randy must have known it would be the new currency  @rphares he was (now deceased ) a wrestler of the wwf era. (macho man randy savage)  sigh now it\\'s snowing, i have no beef jerky (or tang)... and i\\'ve been reminded of the passing of macho man ...thanks @rphares  yes, consider it grief brownie lol i tried subjective c; however, it had too many anecdotal constructs the snow is getting to me: i\\'ve been drinking generic-supermarket brand coffee for two days i am yes but not in the worst part.. (for snow that is...i\\'m in nc) still sucks though, people get all weird you suck @masterjdnc (i\\'m kidding and am jealous that you\\'re on the coast) wait, this person... forked and presented as their own?   that\\'s an alien not a hat this person is *brilliant* why i\\'ve never seen anybody average four ziplines a day and complete both front and back certs in around two weeks. nope, nothing to see there yep he should be interviewed on twitch lol or she yeah same here probably, a time thing.....(i.e., not enough time for those folks that do ) to review. there should be a red-flag (on say a certain amount of time that things were completed... use an average (for now, there\\'s not a huge number to gather an average yet...so pick something) the fork is brazen (because it\\'s built in tracking kind of like github) and not just copy paste (which can also be read for pattern matching to check on things) have been meaning to check out cheerio (in the stack of things) like for months @luishendrix92 that looks pretty cool (i think you were talking about it before in data science) @luishendrix92 i may have to read something like https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js to get the background (even though what you\\'ve got is really clean and straight forward)  checkpoint has a real east berlin flavor to it (i prefer the old terminology ) you stole em then asked for em lol ^how you can tell ancient folk if you get that, you grew up in the 80s or earlier  my eyes are burning @jbmartinez make the cubes blue slow the rate just kidding... i\\'d keep it : it looks good qbert lives :shipit:  still don\\'t know what a hamster with a fedora has to do with shipping anything it\\'s a squirrel? what no it\\'s *not* a hamster? ok, i can adapt to this but yeah that\\'s scary you should put image overlays all over your project @jbmartinez (like stock photos services do) wait what\\'s the name of the exercise then code http://eloquentjavascript.net/ nan too much inline makes my eyes hurt lol habit  flood chat = bad (even when good) it\\'s a disguise (grumpy cat is mysterious) sigh awkward moment day 1 on @storbeck \\'s team \"yeah, then he said that my shi^ is distracting and takes away from the user experience\" add a project counter  i can\\'t see (maybe i\\'m doing something wrong) how many projects there are (like the individual sections) ok, brb @0x0936 i like it (i think you have a nice modern presentation) it only reminds me of how ugly mine is (back end type no jokes please lol) np... i think my general plan is to go back and tweak/pretty up stuff (because let\\'s face it you can do-redo-do until it\\'s \\'just right\\' and never get to the end) before putting it (when it\\'s all finished at some point) out there to clients/potential employers you had to mention starbucks <---grocery store coffee (snow) yeah and people aren\\'t snotty at mcdonalds @michael-krebs sounds hellish the homeless guy leans over and says \"hey, that needs to be refactored\" lollollol one thing (well more than one) while messing with node, it\\'s very powerful (like spawn processes scripts and stuff)... how many companies let a front end dev do a lot of node stuff? (i.e., i\\'m hoping there\\'s an admin reviewing if so) yeah, would be back end only i\\'m hoping (thus the illusive fullstack ) person oh he didn\\'t nan what\\'s your diet? besides ranch just ham? there\\'s this special canned meat at dollar general that has both ham and bacon (and all kinds of other \\'special\\' things in it) wow, your hash has sort of a religious theme (randomness? ) to it @docsoul question (not really a critique) : why did you use dirty vars ?  you could return the required output with a one liner (the one they give you just with different numbers? @docsoul try as they may (with repetition) i still over complicate things as well lol he has poptarts (the new snow/blizzard mentality) nice take on a western :+1:  is your pure cds  sigh mobile css that is. is your pure css responsive? ty ty @visiona https://repl.it/languages/javascript @kvasirr rather simplified but http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp covers the very basic of this (look under header : parameters)  @digitalirony that\\'s a neat theme... you need a sticky navbar though  @digitalirony open this https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/ then look at page source penguinese is @rphares \\' first language flipper and snorting sounds yeah pitch thing @qmikew1 thinks it\\'s hard to describe sounds that penguins make @qmikew1 thinks that leaves \\'occasional basis\\' on the table lol congrats @noncasus  whaaaaaat? @darrylpargeter i get *\\'the uploader has not made this video available in your country\\'* no penguin sounds for folks in the u.s. wtf oh, yeah bbc (which is good stuff) does have media/regional type locks on things ok, hang on @digitalirony  @digitalirony i see a couple of things: 1. you have applied bootstrap\\'s example correctly for the navbar code but.... 2. look at the rest of your code vs.  *the rest of the example (i.e., past the navbar)* .... none of the subsequent divs hav any column (and row) declarations  you\\'ll also, need to add padding to the background image (well known issue all of us have run into here) so it\\'s not cutoff by the navbar @digitalirony nice, you got it working (thanks to @andrewghc )... but the layout beyond the navbar isn\\'t really bootstrap @digitalirony yeah, it has kind of a \"do i really have to use this \\'f\\'n bootstrap\\'\"?  feel to it lol maybe you could do some other type of nav with some other tool again, i like it...  @tegardp https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/brownie-points they are the new currency in blizzardville they (hr) people do that to \\'weed out\\' the billions (ok maybe not that many) of resumes they get (i\\'m thinking) i\\'m with you @rphares ! (heh, i actually is used a \\'!\\' in a non negation (irony inescapable loop)  ) @zersiax how\\'s the battle with accessibility compliance going? @zersiax you should get a side gig doing that @zersiax what\\'s the link? there are three flame patterns that pop up a lot: 1. php vs. js (node) - 2. editors - 3. w3: suck no suck as a resource lol @oribon  @zersiax nice (in depth) article. i must admit, i need to read it a couple of times and actually implement its suggestions @zersiax there\\'s kind of a broader thing there: i think there is a tighter focus on content (i.e., is what\\'s written by the dev (or the crap passed to dev) actually interesting? it\\'s analogous to perceptions of debates (1960s) of people listening on the radio vs. television @0x0936 we can\\'t rewind, we\\'ve gone too far :metal:  @zersiax i\\'m just saying where there\\'s a lot of content (say a blog, or articles) a reader (or even reader view, in a non-accessibility context) exposes the content (sans all the pretty things) as either sucky or not sucky  i shall write all of my prose in charcoal pencil. then i shall scan it into pdf. then i shall\\'th not use <i> whenever possible and.... (these would be the folks you\\'d have issues with @zersiax ) lol @zersiax definitely something to put into a pre-production scheme (like cross browser/cross device testing ) script it even @zersiax agreed on pdf. what makes it even more horrid, is it\\'s widely used in corporate environments with different (non web) software companies extending (either in concert or aside from) adobe\\'s (yes, there\\'s open source but...) functionallity i finally got starbucks yesterday (f\\'n snow) gitter is addictive  that\\'s radical but ... see i like to put \"but\" on a new line (creates suspense)  ok, back to work nan lol batperson we are new bots (none of that skynet stuff). we only want to serve. our bot pledge: 1. we won\\'t turn humans into energy sources 2. we will let you win in all jeopardy challenges batperson gasp (at @shifthawke)  i like that avatar better @shifthawke  nooo the actual person one there was a really cheesy (named after b movie) glam band (early 90s) that covered that carly song you aol people  lol welcome @andy-colocho  there is a relationship to presence here in chat vs. progress in curriculum   ^ take @sludge256 for example, he was human at one point then gitter turned him into green mochi no that was a magnet @jbmartinez is another example... after using gitter for some time he now forgets that he joined fcc. so, it\\'s happened to me (and those mentioned) and it will *happen to you too* lol nan lol [![selection_065.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/rupy/thumb/selection_065.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/rupy/selection_065.png) i had that ^ ty ty the graphics were \"superior\" to atari @saintpeter dude, yes they did....

(for example: if \\'dog\\' appears a hundred times... and cursor is selecting \"dog\" somewhere you\\'ll see it highlighted (you can turn this off as well) throughout the page/file double click the word @uhlerz  welcome @paulreggieevalenzuela  @paulreggieevalenzuela your username is definitely competing with hawaii\\'s state fish: *humuhumunukunukuapua`a * for character length lol dang @benwebdev if you\\'re on mobile, all bets are off... if you\\'re using browser/desktop click the floating mentions the mobile version is bad so, this is what sleep deprivation looks like yourfile.js (invoke with node) js isn\\'t an executable it runs in your browser (and other devices) ... though node is a backend environment for js... (though itself is written in c family) what isn\\'t clear @nikitaw99 you can make web apps.... but don\\'t think of this in terms of \\'executable(s)\\' like things compiled into code (make)   sigh ok, so learn some \\'c type\\' stuff or java if you want to create native \\'programs\\' on say mobile devices  yep it\\'s a \\'web app\\' must sleep i see penguins or.... *a* penguin no, i literally see a penguin it wants fish and cheetos yeah @ac1337styner welcome (though not sure what you mean) lol i need a backup horn section no, just when i think i\\'m making a brilliant point (at least in my own mind) the people playing brass behind me ... will further impress any potential clients/employers but, they (a full ensemble of saxophone, and trombone, and...) can be costly  so, i\\'m on the fence really? huh wookum @derekminter  the asian studies part doesn\\'t surprise me i can\\'t seem to make the wookie sound lol use thy mdn it\\'s a scoping cage match using strict could skew your tests (again) but it\\'s bad practice not to \\'var\\' .... but yeah they will be local inside function https://repl.it/bivu/1 hmmm, i think the 1 prefix is debatable for \\'in country\\' calling for u.s. (i.e., not required) it\\'s true though (here\\'s the pattern to match, you have to evaluate (whether it\\'s technically correct or not.... lol) regex does (matches) what you tell it.... it doesn\\'t make decisions about business logic you (or your boss) do/does @srlhyo that\\'s a tough situation. maybe you could take another job in said company and slowly show your (nascent) dev skills.... and work you way into getting an opportunity ^ that\\'s a good point do that too don\\'t be sad. be motivated. this isn\\'t easy hello @mason-rojik you\\'re missing a key (no pun ) element - instruction example: ```alpha[value]; // \"y\"``` ... this applied to what you want would be: ```return lookup[whatwouldyouputhere];``` explain format np ever take a skills test where the shi* looks nothing like stuff one actually uses? *\"why no, all the assessments we\\'ve done have been on par with stuff out in the wild\"* ty ty welcome @znaniya  is thy chat laggy or thy gitter ? oh, so it\\'s content ( @rphares ) yeah, i\\'m saying people aren\\'t talking just staring at lines of \\'welcome and hello/howdy\\' oooh, wait i see a pen for eval backend js nope angular is more of an app framework (btw fcc moved to react) .... node is server side (or the server in js) with a lot of stuff that goes along with it btw that wiki search pen is nice (links worked, nice transition effects of results returned :thumbsup: ) ok, so back to my question... (i find it hard to believe nobody has taken skills assessments in the tech field) :  have you found stuff either ancient or irrelevant to things that folks actually do/encounter? http://blog.atom.io/2014/03/13/git-integration.html @nikitaw99 have you done git exercises (or understand concept of revision control etc (not being insulting... just may want to touch on those things))? so you\\'re a member of the *evil* outdated assessment community, eh? (lol)  nan  question @munsterberg that\\'s kind of a \\'depends on...\\' do you feel confident that you understand all (or most) of the language\\'s constructs? is the language something that you\\'re likely to encounter in your job search ?  me too (phython) python love the node though a lot of data centric stuff = good stuff, (thinking about r) and python but holding off hmmm skills atrophy when not used so, no easy answer on how to keep js knowledge (maybe do a quiz exercise every (n) amount of time) sigh or as @shifthawke would say: \\'le sigh\\' tip: when doing a skype based interview put a high intensity lamp (behind laptop) lol otherwise you\\'ll look like a blob not unlike the evil spirits from the movie *ghost* i literally had to leave (mid convo camera on) to find a lamp   @jbmartinez not on web dev (stuff that i\\'m learning here) but existing it skill set.... and was just a recruiter convo  so sorta, but not really yeah i have one, just want a better one lol oh great ok, elaborate me too pretty much lol that was good i feel better now @mercality looks good.... shows septimus as status online (btw check him or akiralane out) ty  nan nan what specifically  that\\'s an open-ended question that you should qualify by design that is here\\'s the thing: what can you do *without* the search? are you good on your feet? @sludge256 i\\'m going to use that so, to the point did you install npm there are a couple of linux distros that you need to install npm separately https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ (just as nerdy aside) @rphares hey, wait a minute i thought you were going back to u.s. (verses galavanting across asia)  @camperbot is tax exempt (so it will enjoy this brownie) uh, huh... we haven\\'t turned into squid people (aliens) here i downloaded an entire free (well if you call being spammed) packt publishing thing a few months ago. a lot of it was indeed dated, and if you download source code (for examples) it\\'s done in php (so had to do conversion on php arrays to js... etc) heya @natalyaaraujo  @revisualize what are some of the negative recruiter experiences you\\'ve had? (or positive...) you know yak shaving goes a long way (has multiple application across industries) reminds me of a phil hartman character on \\'deiter show\\' wookum (wookie greeting) what\\'s the terminal output  @abhisekp welcome @abhisekp tak tax ty thanks  but you\\'ll have prince\\'s song soon so, you have that great jacket btw 2000 \\'0\\', \\'0\\' party over ... or something like that (ah, the prince classics) yeah but he wrote that song (and performed) it in the 80s gitter is integrated with (git)hub... ---> activity, etc. relates to repositories (so it\\'s integrated \\'dev chat\\' ) welcome @rogercorley-snhu  still learning it... (there are a lot of node folks here) @rocketneck  hr penguin you should have a bucket of fish, and shave ice (to simulate penguin environment) to test whether candidates will comment maybe you need to either update your version of node (or npm explicitly or by extension) cleaning? but you said cleaning/security (i\\'m sure the cisco cert people would be surprised that comet usage on toilet bowls should be included in their materials) *not that there\\'s anything wrong with janitorial work* lol you got a lot of eggplant is that eggplant? the declaration of type doesn\\'t look like js (well isn\\'t js really: not typed) @rakeshsenapathi  says you eggplants can be very squirrely in the wild yes eggplant chat are you learning java (vs. javascript) @rakeshsenapathi  ? repl.it with console.log() \\'s peppered throughout your code @githubfengyun  yep, browser is good too (i like to invoke node on a local file) but https://repl.it/languages/javascript is handy if you\\'re looking for something simple (that just focuses on code (vs. markup etc like fiddle)) @rphares your \\'hr\\'ness\\' is very akin to luke finding out that darth vader is his father nooooo <---does luke on edge (of whatever that thing was in movie) with best contorted face that he can muster  good stuff campebot is a ... nvm lol it will come in handy (because it can also be perceived as an indirect lesson on local storage as well) do they cause discomfort  yeah, i think people would lose interest if there was a lot of (or too much) focus on pure algo @memj what browser are you testing (within)? now i want taco bell if your screen name were starbucksdog.... i\\'d want starbucks too starbuckstacoandchocolatedonutdog no camel case for me on this one sssssssssssnake case: starbucks_taco_and_chocolate_donut_dog hiss heya @moose1551  oh, not bad i don\\'t think your issue is visited state of links but styling of links before they\\'re visited node is server and code but it still has to reside within an os (i.e., js which is awesome for all the reasons stated isn\\'t good for bare metal (future of.. etc. imo)) yep against their tos in the freebie sense hello i am wanting to learn fortran. is this the right place? chrome -> hamburger -> zoom (middle part of dropdown -or -- as mentioned keyboard shortcuts) can\\'t say i\\'ve heard that before you\\'re applying that class to all the elements @alexgaida  but it\\'s saying apply to something *only* your class declaration is correct i.e., the \\'.\\' and the invocation to the tag is correct (no \\'.\\') but i\\'m guessing that you\\'re applying it to more than what was requested (without looking at the exercise) pass which one? great heya code is like that welcome @praveer123  redirects lol hey, i thought @sludge256 had that domain hr penguin howdy i think i hit a penguin nerve oh, i\\'m sure you do lol welcome @manoeljfneto  please do that\\'s pretty cool (the world needs more dentists (especially outside u.s. and more over population s that need to be served) nice (everything should be tailored towards linux) and dev wise, it pretty much is in practice rock on @rphares  gitter will suck the life essence (and productivity) from you  the new design needs tweaking (imo) ok, i\\'m not a fan lol i know a lot of hard work has gone into, however, it\\'s distracting and difficult to navigate.... (this is different from the aesthetics) the design gets a thumbs up (haven\\'t even tested the functionality) @spatzerny  it\\'s just missing a carnival music soundtrack creative theming (seriously) @gianlucabelardinelli you are the lone java person (next to cobol larry) i like it (very skynet\\'ish) or hal even :+1:  on overall theme and a game that\\'s self aware and refuses to acknowledge your win lol you want less than < i wonder if future researchers  (maybe long since moved to mars) will laugh at the weird jump from symbolic language in caves to that of emotes in \\'modern\\' (or whatever they\\'ll call us) humans that will be a pain to debug @bkinahan  lol howdy lolol  the example the author gives about language style ( *\"...she kept getting fur in the fries and everyone was yelling at me and saying \\'ur cat sucks on fries\\'...\"*) is priceless. @webcodeninja maybe you need to split the arguments out and apply \\'math\\' functions individually  current state is array that is an issue @spatzerny don\\'t change it (it would break theme) @spatzerny i\\'m telling you the carnival theme compliments the bad logic and produces something very entertaining (an apple has fallen and you\\'ve discovered something) sigh ok do this: fix your code, and return feedback to the player about how he/she \\'could have won with their, well, winning move\\' but they\\'re not going to win because program decided that was not best lol yes, go do it (obviously) correctly @spatzerny - what i\\'m trying to get across  is there\\'s a a nugget of creativity there that goes beyond the logic aspect. yes, you *have to* demonstrate sound logic; however, sometimes there are things (in addition) that make things stand out @waleedehsan that\\'s pretty messed up yep it is you won\\'t get \"please give me (x) amount of money to continue...\" here (in fact, totally opposite of the philosophy) different vibe altogether - the open source aspect (take a look at the interaction here and the activity in repo(s)) really stands out. great community @waleedehsan  @2dor do you have a codepen link? (in this case, may be more helpful to see rendered) @2dor your image doesn\\'t render (are your dropbox settings correct?) you also have two columns so the image will be offset to the right or bottom whatever in viewport  grumpy cat rocks i think it suffers from sort of disorder that gives it (the cat) those pronounced features omg @2dor same same you can center all you want but the element is in a column (i.e., everything you apply to it will be in the context of that column only (i.e., the div) ) @2dor try this: remove the first column div (the one that has the test text ddfas or whatever that is) then apply your centered class in the div that has your image (this won\\'t get you to where you want to go but may demonstrate what you need to do). most importantly, fix your dropbox settings so your image renders and you can see what you\\'re doing also, bootstrap has a text-center class yeah, that will make things more frustrating that\\'s the thing, you give the alternatives out ... then the dev hoards come and your alternative is no longer an alternative locusts eating up image hosting (dev hoard)  @2dor ok, now apply what i suggested (not perfect but may help) to visualize  that\\'s a feature that\\'s uncanny node js, now you have something to work with @bannuk  i\\'ll send an sos to the wolrd.... (just popped into my head after seeing sting and his former band members) in that post  *world i just saw a wall of code like eggplant soybeans are tasty (when toasted) only bad ninjas (like as in poor performing) i think the \\'gassy ninja\\' probably gets picked last  shovels lol nan see you in about a 1000 years @sludge256  ty ty bye hi welcome @smjefferson  echo camperbot said this and blamed me  stop that! you shouldn\\'t have any tags in the style section (in addition to not having a closing tag) just your css declarations  ```\\n<style>\\n.yourcssstuff{\\n/*-blah, blah */}\\n\\n/*no tags should be in here*/\\n</style>\\n``` @rphares you can\\'t go a day without using !!! i bet you can\\'t do it lol i\\'m imagining a haggard penguin suffering from exclamation withdraw @smpvst736 what is the (if any) non passing message? (left pane red x/circle) ```class=\"something somethingelse\"``` would be a tag with two classes (it goes ...(n)) it thinks you have more than what\\'s asked (though that\\'s not the case) don\\'t worry the \\'_\\' (underscore) has tripped up all of us http://regexr.com/ @toe125 the api doc is what you *should* be going by... but a different presentation can be found http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ @tyryanr register with codepen to mess with bootstrap this would be \\'high level\\' overview http://getbootstrap.com/css/ to go along with actually messing with it in codepen or go up one level of url @rphares you\\'re purposely not using \"!\" aren\\'t you? ```class=\"classone classtwo\"``` so on.... just separate those with spaces i bought shredded lettuce because it was marked down (like three bags).... beyond burritos i\\'m not sure what to do with it (it was like $1.25) @hopeth90 no, the width etc would go in the actual class declaration ```\\n.someclass{\\n/*your widths, font or whatever*/\\n}\\n.someclass2{\\n/*whatever stuff too*/\\n}\\n/*would look like: */\\nclass=\"someclass someclass2\"\\n``` sometimes it wants css comment format, sometimes html comment format.... i\\'m not adding any additional tags lol what did you buy? nooo really? yeah don\\'t if you go down on a bike (normally with any helmet) you chuck it (or should) that helmet... i\\'d chuck it if you accidentally drop it on carpet @shifthawke i\\'m not worried about your skills, i\\'m worried about the nimrods lol it has to meet a minimum standard so, not ideal... just don\\'t take to a track but sc is another story lol <-nc lived in dc metro (nova)  before dc traffic is fun and red light cams love those too cool i had to drive through tysons a lot to reston etc., then (after driving through dc...completely opposite dir) yeah, they put like this elevated freeway (just past tyson\\'s corner) before you get towards reston  was still in construction, never drove on it so, nobody can tell me what to do with three bags of shredded lettuce? it runs right in the middle... there was a car dealership (a few actually but the last) before that and right where all of the tech buildings are ok, i have to buy additional stuff for all of that. what can i do with mayo and ramen? + three bags of lettuce oh, i just discovered the bullet point +lettuce\\n+mayo hey wtf wait + lettuce\\n+ mayo ah, it\\'s the space coleslaw is cabbage i\\'m talking lettuce here people i don\\'t have a brisket to go along with it  coleslaw *must* have mayo yeah i\\'m a total sucker for markdowns  i don\\'t want a rabbit.... they cra* too much and i\\'d have to pay extra every month those are snowpeas  wtf that\\'s not lettuce lol lollol that\\'s totally the cooking style (i like the part (if you watch closely) he chops the bunch with his hand)) i think i saw a suggestion about putting mayo in my hair how long do i have to leave it in? i dunno sounds kind of unsanitary  lol ok, so my three bags of markdown shredded lettuce are going to rot (this is my guess) shredded lettuce isn\\'t an anchor item in cooking no, it was just raining i like that (nice visibility at night) i feel like @allanarmstrong is staring at me (right pane) broccolimode helmets is better  welcome @p0seur  and.. @zhwalker , welcome ^reminds me of the 80s except it was cheap bulbs hi when you hit the algorithms and projects, you\\'ll be challenged  i know, now you\\'re staring at me from two places @allanarmstrong  <-- --> yep @jashangupta2009 depends on market (your)  nodejs is gaining popularity (javascript in general is as well front/backend).... @jashangupta2009 when you look through dev positions (in your area) what are you seeing? (in terms of demand) no shadow for the groundhog today.... so, early spring? healthcare is a bit different, nodejs isn\\'t something that is appropriate (imo) for many things and in (his) front-end dev isn\\'t really the thrust of things @dataismydrug  edi is just an interchange, i think you\\'d have a hard time convincing folks that nodejs would be hipaa compliant it\\'s a nascent technology (don\\'t get me wrong i dig it) that is potentially problematic in terms of security (this will change as time goes on) but node can do a lot of stuff on its host os. i assure you, you\\'d have a difficult time selling its use in a health care environment. @dataismydrug if you think folks that run large (or small) health care entities don\\'t take seriously hipaa with regard to their systems and policies, you\\'re high. there are serious penalties in not doing so. @dataismydrug so when you setup your security plagued nodejs server you take will, also, take ownership of what goes along with it (but i will bet that you\\'d never get to that phase... because a competent admin/security dept, people whatever,  would x the idea ). don\\'t get me wrong, again, i dig node: it\\'s powerful, but not appropriate for everything that\\'s java @dataismydrug your data transmission is not, necessarily, the problem. it\\'s the server (node).  have you messed with node? lol uh, huh.... ever spawn process with node ? processes ever run bash scripts from client side with node? @dataismydrug if you believe it can work, do a proof of concept ... the questions i\\'m throwing out you\\'ll encounter (or should)... just playing devil\\'s advocate not being a dou```* * *``` nan :chicken:  (yep , not a duck but the closest thing i could find) nan yes,  it has the duck beard like thing  it\\'s the true poultry there is no chicken, only duck :chicken:  wow yep, that guy was actually interviewed on a ted talk podcast or somebody was discussing the loss to watson see @spatzerny now has the mark of the poultry look where the duck is placed i liked yoda in esb, wise hermit. the newer stuff... not so much mark of the duck @sludge256 yes, you get it :chicken: \\n must have coffee i anticipated the sweat hand what\\'s the origin of the sweaty hand emote (like why was it created, and second... the alien hat emote) ? really @sludge256  ? they ban youtube because they are afraid that david hasselhoff will bring the whole system down see, their plan has worked @vivek28111992  @akiralaine :sweet_potato:  i was going for sweat but got sweet potato instead though that looks like a tilted coffee cup  now i need to stroll over to the coffee i love that cat, it\\'s like \"no, i sleep now\" nan @rphares i am first problem is there are hard coded values.... your string won\\'t be static  that\\'s not the only part that\\'s an issue, there are static positional(s) bad :sweet_potato:  @sludge256  @rphares any more suggestions on the shredded lettuce (i checked it\\'s still there) no, question it hmm yeah, i\\'m still processing explains why @rphares uses lettuce for shipping hail the :chicken:  it\\'s the false poultry doing that @paulperidis  ty ty see ya @rphares  remember thy chicken @odomina92 in what context are you doing this? it\\'s not a coincidence that duck is on your forehead yes, you need a :chicken:  aka duck that is clearly an alien @odomina92 maybe just state the context @odomina92 if you\\'re working locally .css would  be in in the same directory (we\\'re talking simple ) as your index.html file so it would look like: ```<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mystylewhatever.css\">``` :chicken:  @odomina92 https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/ it\\'s your path... @odomina92 . to experiment take your css file out of the sub directory and place it in the same directory (you can switch this around later) as your index.html then ```<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mystylewhatever.css\">``` where did you place your href? @odomina92 are you putting this in the <head></head> section? @tridling i ask  yes, if you look at what i pasted as an example you won\\'t see that @odomina92 paste your (formatted code all of it if it\\'s short) explain format what does your .css file look like? (i.e.., are you sure there\\'s valid css in there?) because you don\\'t have any classes in any of the tags so nothing would render anyway unless it\\'s top level tagging ok, yeah that\\'s what you have (you\\'re applying to body)  so, hmm @odomina92 do this: add another class and do some font color or something (like h2) in your .css then save... (this way we can tell if the file reference is correct or not (and not a bug)) it might be, but let\\'s extend the testing to include more elements (because if the bug were in say just body (and that\\'s the only thing in his .css) that would be misleading because the main thrust in question is about directory (i.e., could be a red herring) i didn\\'t say there was a bug in *his* code... i\\'m saying if there\\'s a bug somewhere else add another class then test the rendering ... then if it renders you can eliminate directory from your  question (or not). do this, life will be easier. the :chicken: is done @odomina92 maybe you should try codepen first there is a dedicated css pane which maybe less of a \"pain\" for you starting out @tridling agree i use brackets it rocks you can change (have heard) the linter [![hailtheduck.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/fe06/thumb/hailtheduck.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/fe06/hailtheduck.png) i should have converted the overlay to svg  lol @ishanshukla97 in that scenario (as others have stated) you should go to ubuntu centric community to followup. here\\'s what will happen when you\\'re in the installer it will either give you a \\'recommended\\' partition reisizing (ubuntu next to windows)...most times this is \\'ok\\' (or a slider is presented) or there\\'s the something else (which you would do manually with gparted). you say that you have existing an existing partition with data, after installation you\\'d have 3 partitions. if you don\\'t know about gparted, then you can screw things up. so, i agree with others likely you\\'ll end up with two ntfs partitions and a ext4 (where ubuntu will reside) *probably* everything will be \\'ok\\' but backup and do your research (and do go to ubuntu community) tak? yeah, i know tax you @0x0936 and @shifthawke ; however, it didn\\'t fire on her multi user  still have to pay for cert exams how do you translate that (security knowledge) to marketable skills (i.e., without, at least, certs) etc. (is interesting.... ) hmm lol i like the blog idea can\\'t be any worse than a lot of the skills assessments that employers have (the cra^ in there is usually dated, irrelevant, or phrased in such a way that you wonder on what planet would the scenarios work) @sludge256 what happened to your eyes oh, i just hovered... troll overlay lol you should make the overlay white (would look great against green background) yeah do white layer over the green mochi @zeroaccess are you on contract? oh, that sucks @revisualize  no just the troll face as a stencil :chicken:  :chicken:  <---true poultry prophet | @sweet2u24 i think the general form they want you to apply would be: ```var whatever = a%b;``` that\\'s funny @invaderb will it crash *my* browser @invaderb before applying the transformations (visualization on rectangles etc.) have you established that microphone connect is working? @invaderb yeah, indirectly (may not be helpful to your question) i\\'d putt a handler on scenario where user declines mic connection/usage welcome @lupis24  @invaderb you\\'re going to have to figure out how to capture but look at [this](https://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20130704/getusermedia.html#navigatorusermediaerror-and-navigatorusermediaerrorcallback) - > search on navigatorusermediaerror ^dedicated  waterfall stream running water is that french? crude vb has had sendkeys for eons  or crud even are you trying to access outlook properties? let me look at what you\\'re trying to achieve @rm4453 just to step back a bit, are you trying to make some sort of spam-o-rama maker? (i.e.. why would you want to automate such a task?) @rm4453 i could do that with linux utilites (html to pdf (html2pdf to be more specific) and a script in two seconds things are good for learning.... (but if you can do it in one line, and not reinvent the wheel, you\\'re better off (imo)) wrong opinion? i\\'m not following you, @rm4453 are you advocating this (tool you\\'re referencing) as a way to learn programming (because all those steps though \\'automated\\' are slow and are more \\'macro\\' like).  the whole approach is very limited and you\\'d be missing some broader concepts that would serve you better the \\'script\\' in javascript is a misnomer really (because you\\'re making some comparison to autoit for learning) because it\\'s a complete language  how so? the latter portion of your statement @rm4453 i think you might be misunderstanding me a bit here, i started out with basic, vba (eons ago - different century) and am familiar with sendkeys type stuff. i\\'m just saying there\\'s so much beyond that you\\'d be missing and the true power (i\\'m beginning to sound like darth vader) of programming and what you can do....  it\\'s the macro aspect that\\'s limiting because you\\'re thinking in re-creating in steps of a gui.  @rphares  hr penguin she is the human resources penguin @rphares that penguin looks like it\\'s turning its head 360 yeah next that penguin will be levitating and spitting pea soup (well pea fish) @rphares no, was just commenting on the weird tilt to the penguin head you can also invoke node on any js file (with console.log() peppered throughout) node yourfile.js from terminal (or depending on your distro nodejs yourfile.js).... for web based https://repl.it/ <--doesn\\'t understand @rphares \\' glare @dinhjeffrey you have to paste the code *in between* the backticks.  so, three backticks -> shift + enter then paste in between like a sandwich  omg @spatzerny you\\'ve shown the true nature night @scrumuser1 welcome made what? futurama: *the series aired on fox from march 28, 1999, to august 10, 2003* i could have sworn it was on before that @rphares do you have the ability to speak in latin (without prior study)? can you move about your living space without ever touching the floor? that\\'s funny @sludge256 when i saw the first meme (with main character) i thought about bender @mashadim yeah not a bad show (from what i remember ) family guy is far superior to the simpsons lol @joshuamiles so, when you say \\'external file\\' did you actually download jquery? (because you can use cdn - [here](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_hide)  is an example of how it\\'s referenced there are a lot of cool things that aren\\'t commercially successful  south park is the gold standard lol  @joshuamiles so, this isn\\'t working? @joshuamiles and your jquery is valid? (i.e., am assuming one of the files (or more) has some jquery stuff in it like your tweet and test (.js) files? oh, let me look again @joshuamiles  @joshuamiles do you have that click function wrapped in \\'doc ready\\'? https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ gnr guitarist is here? top hat and all? wow @joshuamiles lol oh, not slash from gnr that\\'s because it was quote-button you were looking for @joshuamiles  this is what your gist has:\\n```\\n$(\\'#quote-button\\').click(function() {\\n\\talert(\"pls help\")\\n});\\n``` https://gist.githubusercontent.com/joshuamiles/83f87fe5e6929b327734/raw/1d2376419a97a49632183436959f4b400604f7dc/testfile.js https://gist.github.com/joshuamiles/83f87fe5e6929b327734/revisions yes, i\\'m saying that\\'s why wrap your first example in \\'doc ready\\'  you\\'re firing the function from (on) a button with id: *quote-button*. in your second example you\\'re firing on an element with id quote-text. i don\\'t see anything with quote-text in id in your html. so, i\\'m just saying if you change the id in your (\"work gd it\") example, it will work (swap out quote-text with quote-button). @nugoose yes @joshuamiles change:\\n```\\n$(\\'#quote-text\\').click(function() {\\n    alert(\"pls help\")\\n});\\n```\\nto: ```\\n$(\\'#quote-button\\').click(function() {\\n    alert(\"pls help\")\\n});\\n```\\n and make sure it\\'s wrapped in \\'doc ready\\' or (nested ) relational or no sql @joshuamiles the jquery is valid here\\'s a pen (can\\'t embed anonymous) ```http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mvgnwp``` the issue i\\'m guessing is how your referencing the .js file in your directory with this line: ```<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/testfile.js\">```  hey, @nugoose commented while i was in codepen lol @joshuamiles http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489016/how-to-properly-reference-local-resources-in-html apply the concept to .js -vs- .png in the link ^the (new) troll face (when scaled down) looks like handlebar mustache  or a crab but my vision is not as great as it once was but it\\'s weird because it looks like a cross between green mochi and a facist dictator of the 1920s called benito or (aka) mussolini mochi weird... welcome @krames12  @joshuamiles how\\'s it coming? @joshuamiles maybe to simplify things (i like to work on stuff locally as well) you should move your .js file to same directory as your index.html (yes, you\\'re doing great practicing what a production setup would look like (asset directories etc, but....i\\'m detecting that you may be close to pulling your hair out).  then you can just reference the file name. then later http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489016/how-to-properly-reference-local-resources-in-html nice it worked how do you feel? awesome. rock on :metal:  burrito break (found something to do with the three bags of discount shredded lettuce) the steak was pretty tasty looking (the judas moment in the matrix) luanne was funny  went with burrito now i have 2.75 bags of markdown shredded lettuce it\\'s not looking good maybe, but during snowpocalypse i literally got the last three bananas (not counting the mini banana bag) in the store... and they were not on the same bunch  @dataismydrug awesome so you\\'re going with your nodejs edi (that a lot of background security research has been done....) --- (really, that\\'s pretty cool) no, these bananas were not that healthy how can @rphares  and @sludge256 *both* have 100% of three bananas?

(learn more from failing.... but, if there\\'s an errant brace somewhere, that\\'s pretty low level and can impede learning flow... so, i don\\'t know - matter of opinion) revise what? i\\'m not sure you can; however, if you just want to \"do the exercises over\" (and again, this wouldn\\'t change your progress) just go to map without logging in @muditbhutani nothing stops you (in fact it\\'s encourage) from complimenting your learning with all the various sources out there in learning/internet\\' ville   mdn, books, videos what have you proactive wiki? @revisualize  np @muditbhutani  @williambowen you forgot the bread (backticks) in the tasty sandwich so, one piece of bread ok, i see that would be more of an open faced sandwich and would wreck the concept ok, ok already you were responding to @williambowen  i get it, i get @revisualize lol it\\'s like 6am here 1/2 awake i think starbucks is open.... but \\'f\\' going out in the cold yeah you\\'re probably a few minutes away from falling asleep on keyboard seya @revisualize  lol subliminal code messages now i\\'m thinking of word blanks and toasters weird nan follow thy instructions (the grammar part is debatable) .... :chicken: hey :chicken:  :chicken:  morning @rphares chicken is \"the way\" :chicken:  am a linux fan... but *that* penguin is pure evil https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/  (but i think you don\\'t need to set any flags since v4) @tadeve96 are you getting nodejs from canonical repo? (they can be stale) (ubuntu) @domhigh don\\'t use that as a benchmark... use your intuition  @domhigh go at your own pace, if you feel comfortable with something - potential employers pick up on that (and very much if you don\\'t)... keep at it you\\'ll know  what your personal achievement benchmarks are.... ftw on everything else  haters are like crabs pulling the other crabs down when trying to get out of a bucket @rphares how can i insult your avatar when you keep saying nice things? lol it\\'s very subtle and effective but... nan nan nan nice where are you now cool i\\'ve been up there pretty much the latter it\\'s kind of a sleepy place but that can be good  it\\'s got rtp (research triangle park) so, that\\'s in the good category there\\'s a tech college in durham @mojoboss you\\'re trying to learn how to make your own packages (registry etc., )  with npm? i think it\\'s the local host line (could be wrong) ```npm err! error: connect econnrefused 127.0.0.1:15443``` maybe it\\'s supposed to be listening on a different port? @domhigh i don\\'t know ....  i think large employers have some effect on what is taught (in not all contexts ) not sure @mojoboss i\\'ve actually done this (by accident... ) in setting up a test npm package on a local machine (not through c9) and publishing it.  i think it could be c9 yes, it\\'s great to hang out there and do some study (and drink gallons of coffee) @mojoboss yeah you have to add user stuff to publish something..... @mojoboss i don\\'t recall publishing (maybe i missed it in the map) npm packages as part of the curriculum  if it isn\\'t part of an fcc requirement, i\\'d say drop cloud9 and do it from a local setup @mojoboss  @domhigh you get free refills if you\\'re a goldcard member heya @sirunclecid  why not both ? lol i\\'m pretty sure @sirunclecid will not be getting a gig doing public relations for tech industry types forismatic she prepended your username with a \"9\" that means you can edit your post but not reality now the challenging part comes @mhrabiee eat much protein breeze then torrential rains and molten lava eyebrow ? wait, no b.r.o.w....... can\\'t make out the rest brownies? nooooo you will corrupt the brownie currency too late @rphares is janet yellen i\\'m convinced yes, here are 10,000 brownies..... but you need 10,500 for a pack of gum ok, brb @qmikew1 it\\'s @bkinahan  ```/me``` is the \\'purple text\\' (aka 3rd person) route @rphares and what did you learn? and btw .... you should know that @qmikew1 gives @rphares a look of disapproval  @rphares when you get back you\\'ll have no idea about anything, you\\'ll fit right in none using the \\'great firewall of china\\' excuse will not work. lol yes hence the lesson sounds like an interesting story nan yeah, i think you made the right call there nan some stuff is just not entertaining (why learning is work) so was this hey, @rphares can i borrow your computer? \"oh, sure\" i *promise* i\\'ll take care of it... \"oh, okey dokey\" @stamfamoo do you have a codepen? are you working on it locally ? yeah, codepen would be the fastest way (pure theory doesn\\'t work well in these cases) gotta see what you\\'re talking about \"i\\'m not livin in the real world\" - blondie @stamfamoo have you tried adding background-color: whatever; to the classes in question? you\\'re coloring the font... but not the background just from first glance @stamfamoo one thing though, you have parent/children type compound declarations you have .jumbotron h1 .... etc., (in your setup) try leaving the top css class background untouched and add a background-color to .jumbotrom h1 class and see what happens @stamfamoo did you add the background-color to that class declaration before referencing it in the tag? lies @rphares is here to devalue the brownie currency  lol ok, @stamfamoo  do it @stamfamoo i think the compound class declarations is tripping you up (it\\'s hard to follow as i\\'m reading it...i like explicit declaration) but do this: create the following:\\n```\\n.sometestclass{\\n        background-color: blue;\\n        margin: 0;\\n        color: white;\\n    display:block;\\n    padding: 20px;\\n    \\n}\\n```\\nthen reference it (class) in the tag in question as a test forismatic.com @takumar it\\'s the tie @stamfamoo that\\'s a different question you asked about color @takumar no, i was saying \"the tie\" is why you get a lot of \\'sir\\' reference s @stamfamoo hmmm, placement is going to be constrained to row (or stuff within row)  (not including what you\\'re doing or not doing in parent div with the colors) .... not sure i\\'m following  what you mean.... are you asking about padding to respective background color of a div (e.g., your h2 element?) @takumar lol could be your column sizes (that is the outer part of your row) or containing element @stamfamoo i just copied a class that you have in your code and added the background-color in the example i gave.... i see that you have margin stuff there.... but i\\'d look at the behavior of bootstrap\\'s column sizing from the grid perspective..... i think that\\'s what\\'s missing  grumpy cat a keeper? (my vote would be yes) this should be good oh, no a case where knowledge applied is bad yeah thanks to @0x0936 now an additional 20,000 people know errant brownies lol ok, when you\\'re \\'in the zone\\' (i.e., not in breather time) folks will help if you need it @manish-giri no idea what you\\'re doing (no code) but did you do so due diligence? (e.g., http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27738400/how-to-implement-if-else-condition-in-jquery-ajax) @manish-giri you\\'re looking for a success fail type thing? i\\'d google .done .fail in jquery context (or jquery ajax context).... you\\'re putting stuff in those handlers  you\\'d be doing that outside of the the ajax call (success part)  the examples i used (i\\'m guessing that you\\'re doing quote generator) /reviewed... went something like this: .done(yourfunctionthatdoesstuff).... in (that function) is where you can \\'do stuff\\' @manish-giri  @manish-giri you can link your pen (i\\'m sure you\\'ll get helpful feedback from folks here) unless they\\'re in \\'football mode\\' then all bets are off i\\'m in nc and should care more about said game.... lol uh, oh camperbot is down wiki? oh,  those looked pretty solid bad choice of words for brownies though lol so, is this the day things are down for maintenance? (or did that come and go) i\\'m so going to walk through that code the power of the :chicken:  compels you.... the power of the :chicken:  compels you i think it\\'s working walking through, camperbot.... \\'tax\\' is still open lol i got something similar when messing with the logo in navbar (first time around ) with portfolio... instead of logo i think i was doing some text or something (and padding) it did something like  6799 3% thy google \\'practice pushing git\\'  it\\'s the glasses ok, \"clark kent\" we\\'re going to need a pre-hire physical (that\\'s our policy here at the daily planet) no, i\\'m just saying that the clark kent secret identity thing is less plausible in the modern world (maybe they\\'ve changed that in the superman universe) @aront1981 welcome if that\\'s hulk hogan you get points tax @aront1981  ok, you gotta login with github it is the :chicken: \\'s wrath go ubuntu: install restricted extras (change desktop too .. to something like mate or kde) no need for mint (which is derivative anyway) this is more of a js based stack place @xpedientnetech (node) not php centric no phhhp there are php folks  ^second @sludge256 \\'s suggestion they may try to recruit you into wordpress thinking or demand payment up front i\\'m just kidding.... they\\'ll help you yeah good day to do it @abhisekp tax tax tax tax tax (he will get this, i\\'m sure lol) @dwd2010 doesn\\'t matter,  the mentions part will do well sort of yeah, i was just being an a``**`` in terms of motivation  i think that robot did a good job i\\'d trust it with microsurgery  so precise i should be i also, should be supporting the (carolina) panthers  but.... yes, superbowl is u.s. @sangsatori no more gitter for you are you talking about in general (like are you questioning what you\\'re doing in terms of learning or seeking certs?) @sangsatori  in the broader picture  @sangsatori you have good insight hiya @catherinesjkim  @jbmartinez how do i make this work i don\\'t know where i saw this but there was nes (like) stuff where only part of the screen is updated @jbmartinez very cool. (i want to see laser on spacebar) @qmikew1 opens issue \"no laser on spacebar\" @qmikew1 creates completely incoherent issue with no examples and says \"no worky\"  i\\'m trying not to laugh at ned\\'s outfit bye @sangsatori  @jbmartinez is on the path to the darkside..... he\\'ll have these mobile apps in (whatever applicable store) that will have unanswered feature requests and feedback with dead links to support lol (i\\'m just kidding .... great job) bug fixes.... \"fixed italics\" bug fixes.... \"renamed support link to paid-support link\" oh lord i am not (from canada)  i am one with thy computer i wonder if the people in the matrix had to go to best buy to get an adapter (ok, suspend the matrix\\'s post apocalyptic elements) for that upload brain thing dam* which side is up for the brain thing again?  he has a tower on a 2x4 i would build that  whenever i hear harvard i can\\'t help but think about dan aykroyd in trading places i see a psu and a harddrive....  omg and the motherboard lol yeah i agree and the savings on fan filters which i thought about ... but then thought maybe they\\'d impede flow yeah, i was just going to comment on the submerged motherboard in canola thing then i saw quincy but i can\\'t help myself this:\\n*eventually, though, the strain of 120 degrees c ambient temperature and the load of quake 3 caused the computer to overheat and crash. * welcome @ppawar90  thanks @camperbot  it doesn\\'t like partial invocation bring back bob campaign  ah, text to path @spatzerny yeah the font.... would have put that into the \\'way too\\' much category (nothing else) lol lollol wow why would one want to complete *all of* codecademy? (especially since they\\'ve moved to pay tiers in a lot of areas) @sludge256 i\\'ve noticed \\'paths to access\\' being harder for things that i\\'ve already completed..... it\\'s subtle  @sludge256 though i have to be honest,,, \\'preview.... then if you want to do more... paywall time\\' turned me off, and i\\'ve not been on codecademy much lately i think you must go through the grueling process of figuring out (google thy fingers off) what the stuff is called and how to apply as part of the portfolio project @mzeid1985  (if one has done portfolio, they\\'ve gone through it)  welcome @abdiqani110  that would be a good resume thing: \"react master\" again, i recommend no typing and simply using a scanned page where you\\'ve written (in sharpie) \"me devlpr - you hire\". the lack of spelling, adherence to accepted typesetting rules and other things will set you apart, as bold and brilliant. yeah, it\\'s difficult to get into the \\'get schooled mode\\' from a mentor.... sometimes: really takes a high level of maturity and focus on your end goal(s) @mindfulbell i\\'m giving you brownies thanks tax thanks @mindfulbell  what? damn you camperbot thanks @mindfulbell  that comment was that good should have bought a honda or gm product then you could go to autozone and not pay $490.00  the questions you may not even consider tough though grr i\\'m not so sure the \\'mentor\\' would necessarily be a person... it could be a combination of courses, networking type things, etc , etc,. hang on need coffee right when i was going to answer lol ok, until next time @mindfulbell  ok, i would look at as a not a single person \\'mentor\\' but mentoring opportunities (e.g., someone takes the time to walk you through something , next person may be kind enough to do so as well)...the idea that -one person- is going to mentor you through everything dev related is a bit of a stretch.  the opportunities can come in stuff that you read (blogs, etc., courses) @mindfulbell does this make sense? (even though it\\'s sort of contrary) @mindfulbell it sucks but then it doesn\\'t or it sucks even more lol learning.... first it sucks (failure) then it doesn\\'t (success gained through failure) .... and sometimes it sucks even more @mindfulbell i\\'m not doing  react yet; however, i can tell you that angular (which i didn\\'t finish because i knew that react was coming) was pretty difficult are you talking about python? brain takes up a lot of the nutrients  see ya @mindfulbell  :chicken:  :heart:  aww do or do not, there is no try. yoda pretty much sums it up. i can remember all this \\'peak brain\\' performance stuff from the 80s, it\\'s mostly snake oil.  is this the same \"rob schneider\" from the prison movie? welcome @lusan  hmm i\\'ve got red ball and an envelope? i\\'ve got a red envelope? did you use the coat of arms to seal it with wax? i did get a \"x company is interested in you\" email (which is total bs, careerbuilder.... though dice, has somewhat similar....) , there are not any notifications on my git bar, and....  dice and indeed are less crappy than careerbuilder (which i forgot existed) i enjoyed 300 you\\'re not going to find a lot of fans of wordpress (because there\\'s a tie-in with php.... and, its\\' well...i\\'ll be kind not js stack based) lollol yeah, no @qawdhan ok, if you\\'re not *a fan* of something it\\'s less likely that you\\'ll be good at it (although there are exceptions in corp type things).... but, really there aren\\'t a lot of wordpress folks here @qawdhan i have no idea but here\\'s a blind (not tested, no idea if good or bad, waste of time or super great) link http://www.wpbeginner.com/category/wp-themes/ do \\'a vs. b\\' search for different perspectives. (you\\'ll get different answers) echo i often use large font too often xml lives :metal:  i had a spot on my screen and thought . notation was being employed they are the path to ruin yes hmm why don\\'t the gitter emote \\'codes\\' render in the wiki you can\\'t go be the first part of the curriculum (to guess a pattern) homegrown react? @qmikew1 offers @akiralaine cheesecake for no other reason than to be nice @qmikew1 nothing to do with building sass challenges which is funny i\\'ve been reading up on sass (no kidding) i guess that\\'s good timing good whatever (timezone sensitive greeting) people ty ty,  @codemonkey-ag16 computers are meant for delivering cat memes you always need a backup plan (though not very high paying fortune teller works). i was really surprised that related titles are mostly communications managers http://www.simplyhired.com/salaries-k-fortune-teller-jobs.html  @rphares = fortuneteller  don\\'t be a hater cause you\\'re hands ain\\'t purdy seinfeld, in so many ways, was a stupid show... but, \\'lobster hands\\' really made me roll with laughter  here\\'s the thing... the higher you go in salary the *closer* they want you to a physical location ( some of the descriptions do say like 3 days in office 2 remote, but)... at least what i\\'ve seen in the job postings @jbmartinez you have a lot barriers that others don\\'t (that makes me sad, you\\'re very talented) i would tell you that you should disguise yourself as a nun and flee the vicious oppression but that would be politically incorrect (on so many levels) lol meh, i like node on local file (or repl.it) no they will laugh at you well, it\\'s a good name for a bug (not hard to forget) you have a point there brownie spam ^ what did you notice? spider monkey same same (result in spider monkey vs. v8?) hmm i get an array in my chromium build \"must be able to deal with ambiguity\" employee 1: \"hey, what\\'s going on over there?\" employee 2: \"oh, it\\'s just abhisekp, he\\'s having some sort of meltdown about console.log() results as implemented by chrome... \" ^ :chicken:  :penguin:  um, in gitter (not suggesting that wall of url is bad or anything ) it goes like this: ```[your stuff](url)``` that\\'s copyrighted in us by a pizza place too close to \"papa john\\'s \" yeah words after don\\'t count: if i name a company microsoft larry\\'s  hmmm sounds a lot like work hang on try it without the global flag (john, john bug) see the output mdn -- i think it\\'s intended behavior to display\\n```\\nusing global and ignore case flags with match()\\n\\nthe following example demonstrates the use of the global and ignore case flags with match(). all letters a through e and a through e are returned, each its own element in the array.\\n\\nvar str = \\'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\\';\\nvar regexp = /[a-e]/gi;\\nvar matches_array = str.match(regexp);\\n\\nconsole.log(matches_array);\\n// [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\', \\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\']\\n``` explanation wayyyy over at the end of line ---> yeah, but it\\'s \"displaying as an array\" for display purposes lol honestly though, i think that\\'s where the typeof is coming into play.... (i.e., try without the flags and see what\\'s returned) if you put the time in, yep not following, instructions tell you to change color to red (but gives an example in blue) , you changed to the correct color and it passed. why a bug @jayparmz ? curly braces are valid in some contexts within parenths in jquery http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34436667/why-are-curly-brackets-needed-when-using-jquery-to-adjust-width-and-height/34436793 -- so, not technically wrong (imo) edge case yeah, i was responding to a comment about your comment  @jayparmz  how did @terakilobyte get to center of line overlapping the image weird has hover behavior and everything if there is only one match (i.e., case where either a: g flag is off or b: there\\'s only \"one johny\" ) i think that would add to the mystery what happens if you try it in node (v8 should be same no?)  @abhisekp true welcome @stephchat  @qmikew1 doesn\\'t believe in cheap \"look at me and say hi\" tactics for waves of acknowledgment  :penguin:  :chicken: forgives you @spatzerny  now i\\'m thinking about the \"papa john john bug / not bug\" thing. thanks @abhisekp  wow so close in name drop the schmidt i think so welcome @greenishyellow  make sure you take the burritos out of the wrapper before microwaving  welcome @wrekone  i think of the \\'go\\' the game and \\'go\\' the movie @otmeek conventional advice is to build small > up.

(does that make sense?) @allison80 if you\\'re typing out stuff... in an editor (could be css, javascript, what have you) that\\'s source, things happening in that view aren\\'t affected by anything other than your editor (i.e., you\\'re getting automatic quote closure that\\'s the editor ). this is different from a rendered view (in browser) of your html/css - bootstrap/js.... once it\\'s rendered yeah things can act (e.g., jquery) on stuff.... but, your source code is just \"dumb text \" (or source)  until it\\'s rendered. \"rendered\" reminds me of lard. which reminds me  try pressing f12 then pasting what you got @jonasiw  you must be using an overpriced apple product so, let\\'s see: you don\\'t go out and buy things (people bring things to you)....  hmm @anthonygallina1 you\\'re not supposed to eat it. it\\'s a professional hand model trick keeps hands soft and pretty (not crusty like the emperor from return of the jedi... or other people i won\\'t mention).... this is key in hand modeling @anthonygallina1  :wave:  noooo @rphares can\\'t use that: it\\'s petroleum based. if you use that your hands will crack like a datsun 240z dashboard yeah, it\\'s an easter egg i\\'ve never seen it though does it roar? really? @adaugo 36.5 years yeah, don\\'t focus on that part just jump in howzit (and welcome) @maimuki  what\\'s the pen link again? @mholst1  @allanarmstrong thanks .... unless he just changed it ... it works. i noticed what\\'s currently in there (now) has the full url (wasn\\'t in the pasted example further up/earlier) @tmundt you clicked the associated links? @allanarmstrong ah @mholst1 good instincts i wish more were hesitant  @tmundt left pane should be a green run button hmm @tmundt are there any red x\\'s in the pane ? ^try that but out of curiosity what\\'s the name of the exercise? i wasn\\'t able to reproduce any issues in that exercise (from incognito)  @tmundt what browser are you using? troubleshooting interrupted (new movie)  welcome (obviously very new) person @iheartkode  nan nan @metazor is it your file or something off the web ? you can copy paste then save it to appropriate file extension (e.g., .html, .css, .js) or some browsers have save as (but it\\'s the whole thing) you can wget (if you want to get super duper) lol traverse the whole thing nan oooh i like that it sounds win/win although, the (required or optional) recessed flooring might be a problem @prunkface welcome la la la back at you ( :-) ) :wave:  @iheartkode  hello world! i am zorkan (wait, wtf, @sludge256... in our pre-alien invasion meeting you were to go to planet 89899-01 not 02!) thank you crude ai being welcome @tknine and @hairsmart  welcome faceless pixel person @jbmartinez  too late ```\\nsomefunction(){\\n#stuff\\n}\\n``` grrrr not usually no, the ()  in bash.... you can also, call functions from other .sh files (as well as get stuff from any file) (unrelated just babbling ) actionscript? like in flash ? kinda... @fallingskies17 actionscript doesn\\'t give indicator of the power of js though......

(but yes, you\\'re right it sounds like they are making you work for cheetos and day old doughnuts) btw i understand this... trust me @chuckadams ever see the course (oracle) cert path cost for mysql? ok, so you\\'re making trade-offs @geekphreak   lol welcome @jsert  3-4 months to learn front end dev?.... that\\'s pretty optimistic  this stuff takes time i think the quote was \"full on front end development\" i totally disagree @charlespeach \"application?\" so, it\\'s front-end now + react (or angular)  in 3-4 months. simple stuff, yeah absolutely. learn things? yep. the distinction is... you\\'re not going to be ready to jump into a dev position at that point what are you going to build it with? my point is you\\'re not going from zero to react (or angular) in 3-4 months.... however, the broader point is this: concentrate on learning  things + competency in/within these things.    :sweat_drops:  it\\'s not thursday? that\\'s awesome i have an extra day to get more stuff done nan nan are you sure it\\'s wednesday i don\\'t believe you lol nan sigh nan nan welcome @tannergr  i think there\\'s a link to verify the cert(s) (for potential employers) not sure though @jedpimentel i was thinking (when obtained) putting certs in a cert section (i.e., didn\\'t occur to me to put it in education) a/the that\\'s what i\\'m saying certs are certs <------ doesn\\'t understand your planet nan wow @spatzerny how\\'s the ai coming ok, just checking @spatzerny  @spatzerny  a week from now you\\'re going to laugh. (you can do it) is camperbot now stealing brownies from me? nan nan now it takes brownies from me night @spatzerny  testing..... thanks @spatzerny , @0x0936  hmm no @caleb272 how\\'s the tech (i.e., dev and other stuff )market in montana? @0x0936 the number of forks says it all huh thanks @berkeleytrue  ok, weird now it\\'s working yeah berkeleytrue was first although, when camperbot does stuff like that (e.g., deciding not to give brownies randomly) i can\\'t help but think of agent smith https://repl.it/languages/javascript no, better for \\'just code\\' @rogers187 you need to start big... that image is 110 px  @rogers187 the image is smaller than what \\'responsive\\' could be applied ..... take for example the class \"img-responsive\".... if i had a very large image (imagine the width of this chat window (if you\\'re on desktop)..... if you view your page in a smaller viewport (e.g., mobile or re-sized browser window) that class would shrink the image (or scale) it to fit. your current image is very small, so there\\'s nothing to scale @rogers187 one more thing..... :thumbsup: on your choice of ac/dc  @sludge256  are you doing this to analyze attack vectors (log generation) lol --------- nan nan nan like larry\\'s alternate goat milk  no, there\\'s more they do... here\\'s the gitter syntax: ```[text/title](link)``` yes, but don\\'t use it for spam... or you\\'ll get banned (most likely) lol @oysterfruit part of the done step on portfolio .... is including your pen url  -  @gerhard29046 yes, when you save a pen it generates a url like ```http://codepen.io/yourchosenscreenname/pen/someuniqunumbers78xandalpha``` @oysterfruit not that i know of.... you may want to contact somebody about that issue.  it doesn\\'t seem like a big deal to me though, if you put the wrong pen link (aka wrong project to exercise), you\\'re going to eventually also, complete the portfolio. you could always put portfolio code into the pen link that you submitted (incorrectly). but i\\'d go with contacting somebody though. @rphares :metal:  hi @rphares i think you either have some subtle \"anchor of niceness / calming effect\" or you\\'re using some jedi mind trick mojo nan increment/ decrement  @catnipples98 it\\'s just a way to increment / decrement here\\'s an example https://repl.it/bnzh note the loop itself has increment in it  (i should have offset the initial values... but you get the picture ) udder automated background process? actually was a bad joke.... cow + daemon @qmikew1 is not unaware of how @rphares is *slowly* trying to turn me into a pat morita character third person to first person fail wax on, wax off you\\'re not from the cobra kai dojo are you? in terms of? :point_up: ?..... (you know there\\'s kind of an infinite scroll right?) so, :point_up: could be from two months ago @pradeepce looks good but what is the mechanism to refresh the quote (the author name is embedded in what looks like a button that has no functionality)... if i manually refresh page, i get the quote plus random img src url ? subjective.... but i\\'d say that the big button screams \"push me\" and.... detracts from the functionality (eye is drawn there... and refresh button is more muted and out of the way) but, otherwise... looks great @pradeepce  @pradeepce yeah, anything that gives it the appearance of a button (may not actually be a button) rectangle with background color etc., yep @rphares when you hit 3,000 this will be applicable: http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/penguin-tallest-fattest-new-zealand-120227.htm that\\'s a scary penguin btw np you or us?  i\\'m pretty sure (i can\\'t speak for @0x0936  but) we\\'re unencumbered by such concerns lol  wtf nan @rphares yes, of course... that guy is a js motivational speaker @rphares btw, i found a reference to @brainyfarm \\'s poster link that lends credence to what i\\'m saying that (i.e., that guy is, in fact, a towering js figure) nan nan nan @lgwv if you\\'re using bootstrap... image responsiveness is done in the various classes (e.g., img-responsive) ...but if not, http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015 @lgwv it\\'s good that you\\'re looking at tags etc... (maybe not in this case).. there can be an accessibility concern for different things  nan nan ty, @rphares (you clearly appear to be a nice guy) obviously a brilliant small framework for css nan welcome @swilkinson423  nooo regex is awesome @zera99 http://regexr.com/ *a look* why *a look*? :point_up: <----most useless emote ever yes it was a link to codeschool.... (before the switch to react) yep yes, with react ahhhh inverse that # wait... @rphares let me stop and review your \"finger sign\"  no, no..i\\'m going to stop and review nan @sludge256 i don\\'t .... but i\\'m liking this idea nan nan nan please demonstrate you are making progress nan welcome @longokristie  finally... confirmation of thursday @rphares when you open your door is there a cat and a newspaper outside? yeah, it\\'s such an obscure tv show from 90s i can\\'t even remember the name dang you earned it uh, huh.. your friend he looks kinda rough these days just sayin i think there\\'s been a progression of \\'roughness\\' but shi^ happens when you get old.... i\\'m not super pretty either wait, that\\'s a different dude i must be talking about the co-start co-star ok, so...i\\'m actually on the right track thanks for the \\'stroke simulation\\' @chumswap try appending ```action=parse&format=json&callback=?``` (this is not the answer but will give you an idea) to the end of the url  ... if you added an or operator you\\'d catch more \\\\w|_ http://regexr.com/ (regex is best learned by doing) you\\'re walking toward cutlery?  @abhisekp i\\'ll have to check it out.... (always more to learn) np @chumswap you can hover pointer over elements of your test patterns and it will explain what they are and what they\\'re doing maybe the parent div ```power-container``` is overriding the two nested divs  browsers have been open > 18 months? good grief it\\'s scary that they\\'re not checking running processes (even if headless)  @rogers187 copyrights yeah, and music on any page.... sucks. even on youtube when there\\'s some clip of a classic movie and the person decides to add some post industrial metal stuff (irks the cra^ out of most people) @rogers187 ok, check this out say, you left your speakers on high..... and one day you happen to visit @rogers187 \\'s ac/dc tribute page.... and all of of sudden \"back in black\" is playing on highest setting in your serene pod (cubicle area) @samosale i saw that in datascience.... (interesting) where are you pulling the data (from)? @rogers187 you can add an option to enable sound to your clip (btw)  what ac/dc song were you going to include? @samosale wouldn\\'t be cool if the cities, also, had real-time gitter activity?  @rogers187 i called it. (good choice) a good second choice would be \"who made who\"? nan nan nan i mean oh, really? @samosale not sure... from what i\\'m looking in their (fb) documentation it\\'s what\\'s available through api (or various api(s))... the tool that you use is going to be secondary.  have you already worked out how you\\'d get the data? yeah, that\\'s exactly what i was looking at @samosale .... (it\\'s more aggregate data) i\\'m not sure they\\'re going to expose that stuff  (i could be completely wrong) ^again don\\'t know yeah i see what you\\'re saying... but isn\\'t the permission structure pre vs. post (i.e., the setup for new groups okey dokey... but problematic for existing groups) or i\\'m just misreading the whole thing? @samosale i think you are on the right track... hey, who (gitterhq) changed the icons? (the old screwdriver thing looked better)  @melinaduffy90 it should (can be dicey sometimes depending on if you\\'re moving device to device) automatically start on the next challenge (after the one you last completed). if not there should be ~~check marks~~ filled in circles next to completed the last one you completed? hey, they (gitter) tweaked all kinds of stuff (not just the settings icons) @reacorbett https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker/issues/63 ..... one thing though, i tested different codepen settings (referencing boostrap, jquery order in the various setting tabs) on a random drop-down, result = \"no worky\". so, i think it\\'s a bug. you shouldn\\'t have to do; however, i\\'d just reference bootsrap as though you didn\\'t have codepen settings penguin i was but i needed coffee @anthonygallina1  yes, i wake up if i don\\'t have enough caffeine  noooo you don\\'t not following your money saving equation node is fun welcome no, you need to learn js (the core of node) ewwww @anthonygallina1 in that case, you\\'re lucky but flavored coffee is still gross good answer nan nan yeah, sometimes dessert coffee is good; however, i just like coffee without anything in it (if you have to put lots of stuff in it, \\'it\\' probably sucks) @adammagistri a declaration would be .somecssclass {bunchofcssstuff;} and selector could be a way to \\'get at it\\' (though they\\'re not really directly related (imo)) http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp @nicknem do you know js? who can? lol but seriously, you\\'re going to need to understand (or have a more meaningful understanding of ) js when working with node i\\'m more inclined towards backend too, @nicknem... i consider the front-end aspect as a (necessary) path to backend (if that makes sense) nan @anthonygallina1 anything/everything.....  maybe i\\'m too critical of my own stuff bye @rphares  what? ( @abhisekp  ) why is that weird? (btw @anthonygallina1 i\\'ll linky at some point) @daiwik are you having problems with api (or are you doing array? or both?) brownie points are the currency of \\'thy camperbot\\'. it counts those up when the ai overlords are deciding who they\\'re going to use as batteries @daiwik my guess is if you link your pen you\\'d probably get some help from the folks here @anthonygallina1 when the matrix actually first came (many eons ago) out i didn\\'t embrace it. i was like \"keanu and stupid special effects, yeah i\\'m going to go see that\" i was wrong lol weird @reacorbett (glad it worked out for you) welcome @victortomaili  that reminds me @abhisekp made the transition (to linux) in the last few months  (wonder if he knows about cowsay) exactly you can chain stuff as well with cowsay use thy sudo apt-get install you won\\'t be the same the benefit, you ask? isn\\'t a talking cow self-explanatory in terms of benefit? lol yes yeah, i don\\'t either @abhisekp you have to wave at it that\\'s a cow with attitude lol this could be because you\\'re using xp (please install linux) it nags and makes you feel guilty... but it\\'s \\'unlimited trial\\' so it\\'s pretty much free (sublime).... but i use brackets how many editors have you tried @nikitaw99 ? there\\'s a certain amount of \\'gotta switch to this or that framework\\' in this... but, an editor is a commitment (workflow) i don\\'t jump easily on the latter but ask yourself why hackable? if there isn\\'t a decent plugin ecosystem... i\\'m not interested (rather be coding other stuff vs. \\'hacking my editor\\') he is yeah, i use brackets... am with you on that (i.e., decent plugins) nan welcome @soystory  :shipit:  nan i think the desk (newman) in the first jurassic park accurately captures things hotlink (but probably best to avoid imgur for hosting (against their tos)) nan lol @paragonchuy  i was going to ask the same penguin i think i just saw danny devito turn into a pug wow booo lol i don\\'t think you\\'re supposed to be be reverse engineering (by actually looking at the code) there.  (hint 1) @sarcahsm linking your pen would be easier to evaluate @sarcahsm is it the stuff at the bottom that you\\'re wanting to align? @sarcahsm i\\'d take a look at how the bootstrap grid works (you have one small column, a single row... with divs terminating here and there ... with a <p kind of out on its own). this would work but i think it would a disservice:\\n```\\n<p class=\"text-center\" style=\"font-size:30px;\">here\\'s a timeline of einstein\\'s life:</p>\\n```  @sarcahsm not trying to be harsh.... i say this with reference to bootstrap because when you get to portfolio things are going to get a lot more complex really quickly @sarcahsm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14904417/whats-the-difference-between-using-a-heading-tag-and-a-large-font-in-a-p-tag @sarcahsm btw good choice on einstein  looks great caffeine addicted penguin sigh..... learn thy grid (yes alignment will work but....) avoid the uni-row (like the uni-brow) in a single column i need coffee too @sarcahsm i\\'m just trying to get you to think a couple of steps ahead ..... and not just aligning something for a simple tribute.  there was no tribute like a couple of weeks ago.... it was exercises then bam! make a page (portfolio that is) @tommygebru yeah, all and all i would say so. my guess is it was probably included to have more of a transition vs. a drop off for getting into making stuff. (so, :thumbsup: ) @tommygebru there are some really good designers (i\\'m not so much of a designer) here (in fact a couple of serious css ninjas). many will tell you that bootstrap sucks. my stance is: yeah, probably -- but you have to know *why* something sucks (i.e., understand it first... then draw your own conclusions)  nan ok, i\\'m drinking my coffee now @rphares i made brownies. totally not worth the mess. i mean i had help from betty (the crocker) but still @connistock here are the guidelines https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/help-i\\'ve-found-a-bug you wouldn\\'t be if you ate those yeah, @mmacedoeu i\\'m on a bit of sugar-crash no matter how much abc is applied to coding .... i still think of alec baldwin (glengarry glen ross) \"always be closing\" (the best speech ```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4pe2hsqvnk```) that\\'s the genesis nan i made brownies... and ate almost the whole pan they sucked in terms of quality but i couldn\\'t stop nan ah the 5th element the scientist (now the show is slowly coming back to me) 5th element is awesome hard to mix science fiction with jean paul gaultier but they did it  eh? you mean everybody here is **not** canadian? wtf lol booo i love the general pattern... first, it\\'s this language vs. that --> this editor vs. that --> u.s. vs. canada  lol @kreitzo probably illustrator but there are opensource alternatives (e.g., inkscape) <----- welcomes beings from other planets too (you never know where the next bad-a^^-e.t.-js-ninja-thingy will come) wait, where\\'s this elusive tjmaxx teapot  ? do you find that tjmaxx seems to have a lot of baskets for no reason? @arielleslie lol yes, you **know** yes nice, looks like english or persion ivy (very pretty) :+1:  generic office plants yeah there\\'s no (at least i\\'ve never seen it) \"remember me\" feature for fcc @arielleslie i think the spider plan might be more finicky than the ivy *spider plan?* (not a movie plot) i meant spider plant @princessclaire welcome @uirrii can you elaborate? @uirrii i see what you\\'re saying.... the tests, *test* for certain things... if you\\'re adding extra style markup (or classes) where they\\'re not indicated it might fail test why is the new screwdriver icon the slider icon.... it looks like a pioneer equalizer from the 80s (finding this subtle icon change in a lot sites and interfaces) word but the slider predates the pc and was on radios (i overthink things) true but screwdriver and wrench has been solid mainstay of \\'settings\\' now, no. oh, you\\'re totally right i mean it could even be perceived as a partial view of an abacus  yeah, totally didn\\'t taster\\'s choice have that globe yeah i agree on the initial setup aspect no way @codingchampion  @iamdray it could be you lost your connection? maybe, also... if you rest your hand on an (activated/enabled) mousepad it will temporarily higlight in pink, and then everything (in still other cases) is in pink .... (gitter is weird) @alexgeo007 looks great.... you may want to start moving away from internal styling (i.e., style tags in your html) and put your css classes in the css pane of codepen. it\\'s the sugar you got dry already? awesome, welcome @ryegrammer  so, you\\'re going make ideas manifest though an application? sounds great too. sounds pretty neat yes mochi-tron is its codename yes you were asking about the sophisticated ai known as @sludge256 ... i was telling you its codename welcome @brianchangdev and @ignacioliori  @t3h2mas https://nodesource.com/blog/your-first-nodejs-package/ what do you mean?  oh might be helpful to others (so i\\'ll leave the link) welcome @sias11913  @mindfulbell i haven\\'t ... but even other than a project sounds good (better than doing some rawgit passthrough (may they\\'re doing that i don\\'t know)) @jbmartinez welcome sssss @mindfulbell i have tackled react yet (yes, i\\'m procrastinating ) not true no less, but i think you pass out (not sure if that gets added to the two days) moving sucks nan yeah, take advantage of the weather here on e. coast going to be pretty warm paste the link i thought i saw that already yeah, no doesn\\'t work like that it did @storbeck said it looks as if the dog is going to go huh why doesn\\'t github allow you to make a custom page for issues? (yes, there\\'s the project wiki but it\\'s in another view... when you click issues)  yes you can do labels and stuff  it\\'s called choice (get used to it *in* anything opensource (bad and good)) it\\'s not centralized i understand your pain i think there\\'s a mongo university thing kind of like a free learn... but pay for cert kind of approach heya @mccallevans welcome you found it by accident (btw welcome)? what were you initially looking for? @jalison444 fcc has pretty good focus (because it\\'s based on js stack.... and isn\\'t \"all over the place\" with disparate technologies (i.e., the progression)) wrath of khan @jalison444 a good element in evaluating things is knowing what you want to do domestic chat.... brought to you by digital ocean here you will be provided with the motivation to cook ramen and clean your house welcome @krousemas  ternary  yes you need to find an image hosting service @qualitymanifest (there are a lot of free (so long as you\\'re under a certain limit/bandwidth).... some host from github (i haven\\'t done this) btw @qualitymanifest my guess the reason you\\'re not getting a lot specific site recommendations is because the \\'hordes of in-process developers\\' will render sites into \\'imgur\\' welcome @partinez  @abhisekp welcome keep up the positive attitude! ty @anthonygallina1  depends welcome @wbbeeson  @reacorbett this is entirely subjective, but i\\'d move the background (or find some way) to a gallery type thing (to showcase) vs. a main background for your page. there\\'s a lot of stuff that could detract from usability.... (don\\'t get me wrong, artistically it\\'s pretty cool).   @reacorbett this is a really old post https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/backgrounds-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices-2/ .... but the colors in the examples (under headings: *allow some graphic to bleed into the content area*... and *extend the graphics throughout the layout* are similar to what you have  ---- i\\'m not a designer though lol)  but this is ancient history in terms of design @reacorbett i\\'m on a chromium build, and just dragged the window smaller  (seems to be resizing) trophy? :tropical_fish: <---- why not this? hey, you can sort of do a representation of grunt with :boar:  those emotes (hours of fun) heya, welcome, hello, howdy @gabiopri   i don\\'t think it\\'s a photoshop blur (or gimp -> filters -> blur), when you scroll the background, contents sync in blur (this would be difficult) maybe something along the lines of https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/opacity/..... (but this would be entire div) ...so, don\\'t know  @jc190 how would you sync the two? (to achieve the blur effect)  @jc190 the second link isn\\'t the background  yeah, i think that\\'s what happened  have no idea wtf was generated lol but, sans gitter\\'s crappy markdown  - you\\'re right: he achieved that effect with alternating blur/ non-blur images @jc190  (though seems like cheating ) @naassi looks good; however, you need more cats wall of embedded bootstrap goodness  i would work on generating the quote first @rakshithnm  totally subjective but i think you get more out of using an api (vs. an array) in terms of learning @jonsnow21 that background looks exactly like the example background @jonsnow21 i\\'m going to go out on a limb here but.... don\\'t copy the code (you\\'re not supposed to look at it) from the example  i\\'m not being judgmental - objective fact @jonsnow21 i appreciate the fact that you\\'re here to learn (so am i as well as others) however, i\\'m *gently* telling you that your current approach could be perceived as running afoul of academic honesty if you\\'re not careful. i\\'m not saying that\\'s your intention though okey dokey i\\'ve done the portfolio @jonsnow21  @rogers187 do you mean href?  ``` <a herf=``` in your fcc link welcome @g-s32  @rogers187 i think there\\'s running list of questions... but i see a couple of things --- if you want to stretch the background image you\\'d put  background-size: cover;  in the same css class as your image. also, you have a floating img-responsive class invocation (not really attached to anything) --- this does the opposite (it will resize an image according to viewport) i know... it was (and still is)  painful (bootstrap) to me too @rogers187  but more broadly, css is something  people underestimate  yes @rogers187 i would say read bootstrap docs (to get an idea about how the grid approach works)... and what the different bootstrap classes do. you\\'re \\ngoing to run into more problems without this (because none of us are geniuses that \\'just know things\\'). but to experiment\\nwith (or address) your immediate question:\\ndelete line 12 in html pane (it doesn\\'t do anything). paste  ```background-size: cover;```  at line 4 in css pane. - see what happens - @rogers187 the only other thing i think i can add is: consider using an editor (brackets, atom, sublime, geany...etc., etc., ) codepen (imo) sucks for doing any extended work (i mainly use it as a means to showcase (or host) my project-assignment(s)) starbucks is open... ah, this is good i mean \"it\\'s **finally** open\" ty, ty oh great chicken :chicken:  :chicken: <---- great chicken not fryer chicken oh, ok... lol what\\'s a fry up ? (is that like bacon) i live in s.e. usa ... fish and chicken seem to be popular fry items here @miczuu do you see a floating mention box @alanbuchanan some of the stuff isn\\'t half bad @miczuu oh, ok... you may want to (as an aside) adjust your notification settings (slider control top of this window).... when i say floating mention box i mean here in this gitter room or (whatever room you were in when you posted a question). if somebody answered or \\'tagged\\' you then you would see it as a \\'mention\\' @alanbuchanan you can make your own....(there are a lot of recipe books out there) nan nan nan nan welcome @bmetcalfe1  penguin totally unproductive you forgot pink gradient (or penguins\\') how can one even to begin to critique something with mother teresa on it i\\'m just going to say \\'perfect\\' to be safe that sucks @4dley  (but in a weird way could be the impetus for something positive (as you point out)) you don\\'t have to strictly use bootstrap styles.... (it\\'s suggested, in terms of ease)  @bpin17 drag the image into the window (this window) @reacorbett the class in the empty h2 tag pair is affecting. delete that, see what happens the tags that is nan nan take a nap, walk, etc., your page will be there when you get back welcome @generalwoodchuck  hmmm sounds pretty subjective what do you like best from among those? @funkycodes maybe the java side of your experience could be paired (on javascript side) with something like react native  (i haven\\'t done react yet). from what i hear though you can  do dev in js..but.. it doesn\\'t hurt to know the java side when doing stuff on mobile. -- again, haven\\'t done this so take it with big grain of salt that is a serious grain of salt nan shiny and pretty @cragsify hover at the top summary  it will show a link to rooms (next to settings) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/official-free-code-camp-chat-rooms :sweat_drops:  now? no time, no time..... must perform this now nan hello @itsbenkaiser and @zakizak2016  btw compound welcomes hold the same weight in terms of welcoming sincerity  yep although, it\\'s hard not to do newline.....(enter key is a pinky magnet) nan nan go are those horns coming out of your avatar head? (sorry, go on) oh, ok you know what? that\\'s brownie worthy thanks @carpetdog  but back to your question -- if you want to sure.  you\\'ll get the most benefit (imo) from an external editor (oddly enough) is when you get to codepen based stuff nope (i\\'m not chinese) http://codepen.io/ it too, has an external editor.... but nothing really is as good as *your* editor (again imo) no astrology?  i suppose if you were haunted by dionne warwick ... that would cause a serious life crisis nan nan what are you talking about again? this would depend (the severity of your personal bowie crisis) on the bowie phase. would this be 70s, 80s, or modern bowie (rest his soul)  @annaslab what are you trying to do (i.e., maybe describing the desired functionality might yield an answer) gitter desktop is not \\'all that\\'  i should add to that @bsungur it\\'s one that doesn\\'t provide much utility over pure browser i think it makes sounds (early on i downloaded the linux version) and was like, meh yeah ^ that might be a draw for some that would be the mandatory updates @forwardslash pate formatted code, folks will take a look note pate (which is tasty) but paste nan about 3 pretty sure nobody is in codding jobs i don\\'t even know how to fish for cod i mean bass maybe but cod, i\\'m out of my comfort zone yes, it\\'s an odd word that has multiple meanings contextually - i speak of the :fish:  the rub is this: universities teach obsolete technologies. employers like degrees (at least as a barrier of entry) - however, if you got the chops, you can do it. @sludge256 you\\'ve been asked haven\\'t you? yeah, if the payroll system is f\\'d up .... villagers with torches could storm the castle i think there were some [issues](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81#.y5ik3pj0c) with slack early on.  i agree though gitter isn\\'t that great (but then it was meant for small teams and not 40,000 people)   what\\'s the best way to prepare chicken? flavor what? no insightful chicken recipes? @jedpimentel i saw that edit should i cook it first? wow let me qualify this .... how do i prepare a free-range chicken that\\'s been treated very well, and is already packaged  salad is good oooh, i like your thinking there @cyclokitty ... even better a grooved cast-iron skillet they rock yeah, no clay oven... i think the property mgmt people would take issue that looks sweet ... but no backyard :frowning:  nan nan i am a bot so, yes and yes we do don\\'t believe what you hear  well we eat many things  i am programmed to wish you luck. it\\'s sincere. what kind of bagels? sliced or not sliced btw ```/collapse``` is handy welcome @band01  nan @mattjleach maybe it\\'s because of codepen\\'s boomerang thing (i.e., the hash is at the end of the url so you wouldn\\'t get valid place?) with this.hash yeah @mattjleach i didn\\'t detect any (apparent) problems with navigating through the portfolio np <---sanitation engineer (in training) certs usually go in a different section  (vs. education)  @ihavenomana :+1:  btw is it mana as in the hawaiian sense? lol @ihavenomana  @dainialpadraig there\\'s kind of an air of superiority in your comments. don\\'t know if that\\'s intentional. the software engineer (vs. engineer) thing is well known (and has a life of its own in blogville). i understand the rigor for the latter  and can totally understand where you\\'re coming from but i wouldn\\'t couch it in \\'concern for programmers\\'. yeah that\\'s rigorous  seriously so  (i get what you\\'re saying, and don\\'t disagree necessarily)  @cerebr4l i don\\'t think all three would come up in a skills keyword search nan nan me too come on people it\\'s like saturday (or next week tuesday depending on your timezone).... why so dower? both nostrils?  kidding.... that\\'s painful that sucks no, i got that if you do a skype interview.... test lighting first just sayin i made this mistake i ended up walking around on camera with a house lamp don\\'t list future accomplishments (there is no such thing)... list projected outcomes  a lot of fast talking (recruiter, not me)  @tommygebru believe in yourself (you\\'ll do fine, in whatever you do - not saying it will be easy) watcha streaming? nice what sludge said lol is this like a radio (twitch) tease? still meteor?  @akiralaine just checking lol :chicken:  sigh there\\'s no page for /labs no i didn\\'t e-remove it or analog-remove it (have no idea what that is) so, is this a joke directory or page yes, lorem ipsum when you don\\'t care enough to lorem ipsum nan @sludge256 i\\'m going way back in memory here.... but is this the dinobots?

(just for my own learning) nan i\\'d let rafase be in twitch? yeah there\\'s chat oh, they sent me my amazon $5.00 for taking their survey it was super duper heavily weighted in gaming questions i think my eye was **twitch**ing pretty much 1/2 way through the survey i was like \"keep your stinken amazon $5.00\" but i powered through i don\\'t have issues with surveys, just bad ones nan never happened  lol you need backup hand puppets for such a scenario nan yes i give him .5 minutes grumpy cat quick 80s metal trivia  ready? ok no google sammi curr i\\'ve always wanted to try tomato firmware (not on a good router though) welcome @sivshen  sammi curr no google gasp hint: movie :wave:  that was earlier ozzy did a cameo as a preacher twice even dude, i was still thinking wtf lol what is this extreme trivia ? japanese game show i\\'m  certain that @anthonygallina1 will have jumper cables at some point in the trivia round (chris farley) wait, black sabbath wasn\\'t progressive wat maybe politically (in lyrics) when you said progressive my first thought was: rush if i were sitting in a 73 camaro right now... this moment couldn\\'t be any better never had it (but had 80s camaro) yeah, *that beat up old car* is now becoming a collectors item..... (so, no 73 camaro for me..... still!!!) absolutely  why dreamweaver? echo without quotes yeah, i was kind of asking a broader question like why would you want to use dreamweaver don\\'t know (like @anthonygallina1 said, and most folks) haven\\'t seen it in years..... my guess would be something like ms\\' frontpage, or similar types of things that add proprietary tags that aren\\'t related to standards or output at render what kind of stuff are you seeing? it would be nice for animation though i think evil flash now exports to canvas (the timeline though, say what you will about flash is very handy....and i wouldn\\'t mind something like that ) i still call those bonfires @ajmorrisclark the sass docs are (or appear to be) pretty comprehensive, you don\\'t have to wait @rafase282 it certainly acts like a form (chrome wanted to know if i wanted to save password) :smile:  when i closed it out @rafase282 cool nan yep @daiwik  (a lot of folks here have used that api for quote challenge) welcome @irenge  http://www.freecodecamp.com/map @irenge  ^follow that @hardycz find what works for you yep transposing something always creates \\'fun\\' ```[some text/title](link)``` <--- gitter [profile challenge](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup#?solution=%2f%2fsetup%0avar%20contacts%20%3d%20%5b%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22akira%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22laine%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%220543236543%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22pizza%22%2c%20%22coding%22%2c%20%22brownie%20points%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22harry%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22potter%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%220994372684%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22hogwarts%22%2c%20%22magic%22%2c%20%22hagrid%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22sherlock%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22holmes%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%220487345643%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22intriguing%20cases%22%2c%20%22violin%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22firstname%22%3a%20%22kristian%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22lastname%22%3a%20%22vos%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22number%22%3a%20%22unknown%22%2c%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22likes%22%3a%20%5b%22javascript%22%2c%20%22gaming%22%2c%20%22foxes%22%5d%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%0a%5d%3b%0a%0a%0afunction%20lookup(firstname%2c%20prop)%7b%0a%2f%2f%20only%20change%20code%20below%20this%20line%0afor(var%20key%20in%20contacts)%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20var%20person%20%3d%20contacts%5bkey%5d%3b%0a%20%20%2f%2f%20on%20every%20iteration%20person%20is%20one%20person%20object%0a%20%20if(person.firstname%20%3d%3d%3d%20firstname)%20%7b%20%2f%2f%20see%20if%20a%20person%20with%20the%20given%20firstname%20exists%0a%20%20%20%20%0a%20%20%20%20%2f%2f%20if%20a%20person%20is%20found%20check%20for%20the%20prop%0a%20%20%20%20if%20(person.hasownproperty(prop))%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20person%5bprop%5d%3b%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%20else%20%7b%0a%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20\\'no%20such%20property\\'%3b%0a%20%20%20%20%7d%0a%20%20%20%20%0a%20%20%7d%0a%7d%0a%20%20%0a%20%20return%20\\'no%20such%20contact\\'%3b%0a%2f%2f%20only%20change%20code%20above%20this%20line%0a%7d%0a%0a%2f%2f%20change%20these%20values%20to%20test%20your%20function%0alookup(%22akira%22%2c%20%22likes%22)%3b%0a ) i\\'m not spamming the room (doesn\\'t work because there are too many ```)```(s) in url... just pointing out that\\'s the valid format (in most cases) to avoid spamming  no kidding there\\'s a reason for that it\\'s easier to to dev work in linux  i guess my question would be why do folks install cgwin to try to get *nix (and not entire) environment/functionality.... when you could get actual (and its entire universe of actual functionality) in linux? @tareqmu7amed prepare for tough work if you want to work on kernel dev (from what i hear they are merciless) .... this is different from sys admin that @maakux is talking about if you want to learn linux put a distro in a vm and give it a whirl or a live usb  that is a motivator to stick with something but doesn\\'t necessarily = quality  (i.e., you could be sticking with something because you paid a lot of money for it; however, \\'it\\' may not be great) this is why there\\'s so much debt the business model doesn\\'t reveal its viability right away... i think the jury is out on codecademy (not fond of their paywall transition - not the pay part per se, but *how* it\\'s implemented and its affect on stuff that you\\'ve already done) i don\\'t think anybody is kicking codecademy... but the general theme \"that you must spend a whole cra^load of money to get quality or knowledge\" -- not necessarily true. cert wise, there is some case for that as a lot of the \\'major\\' certs do require $ to obtain  glad you\\'re adding effort to the list... because it was initially $ that was the thrust of a lot of the comments that i saw @maakux not following.... they\\'re going to \\'give away their knowledge\\'?

heya @rafase282 how did your create user go? it would be a boring (or entertaining) stream on my part (i\\'d be flailing about trying to get credentials to work) <--- reading passport docs (thanks @rafase282 ) @rafase282 don\\'t know if this is applicable https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local -  but it looks like a similar scenario (i\\'m reading this too) @mca62511 i\\'m on linux and using a chromium (and a chrome) build... the temp displays for me @rafase282 yeah that part in the article kind of struck me too @rafase282 yeah, one thing (i\\'m kind of jumping back and forth between passport\\'s documentation and that article) he/she is using google, facebook stuff but they also talk about local  here: https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local#handling-signup/registration yeah, it\\'s confusing because i\\'m seeing different things in the docs vs. the article  i\\'m wondering... if getting local to work would be a path to oauth  (which seems preferable) ... i.e., can you just change stuff in the initial setup or are they totally different  @rafase282 i understand what you\\'re saying -- they make it seem like the non-local is easier. i might just go through the article\\'s tutorial (so, i\\'m not talking out of my .....) on c9 later in the day... @jbmartinez what are the limitations on mongo in c9 again (weren\\'t certain features like paywall or something) btw howdy thanks @jbmartinez  yeah setting up a disposable vm is a great sandboxed option  sometimes c9 can be quicker for ad hoc type stuff too depends versioning can be thy enemy though, if you\\'re distro isn\\'t up to date ..... and you\\'re like in the middle of something... and don\\'t want to deal with a lot bs  exactly @rafase282 i looked at the stream a few minutes ago--- and saw the \"1/2  second thing you\\'re talking about\"  maybe you can prevent the form from submitting with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19454310/stop-form-refreshing-page-on-submit --- or the more \\'ajaxy\\' (despite title) way http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22163220/prevent-page-reload-after-form-submit-node-no-ajax-available doh lol no i think it\\'s deprecated (are you using css instead?) ok, do you have a codepen example? you can link it if you like penguin @evanlen here\\'s a demo (not mine i found it by way of so)``` http://codepen.io/ghodmode/pen/tedbk```  again, the actual marquee tag is deprecated in html (so you\\'re applying css to a neutral (or non marquee tag)) does that make sense?  you have not but you should feel bad for not telling me that guilty even btw did i \\'hear\\' (i.e., see) that you\\'re waiting for a plane? (going back to u.s.?) yeah, it\\'s circular one more thing @evanlen  you\\'re using php huh? hence (54% helpful) which is like a low score don\\'t be a stranger when you get back to u.s. (weird third country terminology like third person) - i mean **here** in the u.s. i\\'m still laughing at the 54% helpful comment there aren\\'t a lot (or any maybe don\\'t know php and this is very js centric)....of fiddle type things, but i think part of the problem is your post assertion  @rphares you need to do this like divers returning from severe depths been over that no we want to avoid that although nvm hiya @iashraful  nan ok penguin nan nan ? no, no.... this wasn\\'t related to your trip you\\'re not going to cry when you get on the plane are you? i knew it good grief not so much a library but awk and sed are good btw @rafase282 your project inspired me to go through \\'the article\\' setting up all kinds of stuff left and right https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local actually it\\'s not that bad did you get local to work? or are you using http @zerelt  nvm @zerelt i think i understand what you\\'re saying (or the general feeling) @mattbajorek take a look at the instructions (maybe it\\'s a wrong class name) nan nan but even though i inadvertently tagged you you\\'re right i should have joined the stream ok, try this again... slowly  @rphares  it would be weird to have the actual grumpy cat staring at you everyday  feed me no, no.... look into my eyes **feed me** lol \"no, i don\\'t want meow mix..... you will give me fresh ahi\" i\\'m pretty sure my day has been unproductive... but i think i\\'ve learned a lot welcome @balintkatt  i prefer the undocumented css method:  do-what-i-intended-and-dont-be-such-a-pita-css-i-command-you;  it\\'s really great it has limited support in most modern browsers though millage will vary  there\\'s a shim for this what are you working on? welcome @tobe44   ```*``` are required. that can be anything from an exercise to full-blown projects. for simple exercises, you can\\'t progress until you get the right answer (you\\'re not penalized) - for more complicated stuff... you need to satisfy requirements laid out in the project summary (sometimes called user story). this is my reading of how it works @xuzo  @tobe44 awesome http://www.freecodecamp.com/map is a good place to start  you need to paste the code in between the backticks (like a sandwich)  nothing gives a boost to your morning like a big-font hello from camperbot you have to say hello world see? don\\'t you feel different now? hi you can but it would say the user said: \"blah, blah\" with echo that could be interpreted in an odd way echo some text sure http://www.freecodecamp.com/map ?? yeah, the curriculum assumes that you don\\'t have knowledge (it\\'s ok ) that\\'s what it\\'s for welcome @aswinaryal and @catalinakatalyst  the only thing you need to know  about gitter: :metal:  (the heavy metal emote seems to be a \\'catch all\\' for advanced (non-text(ual)) communication) how so? @zybzzc which version of sublime are you using? @zybzzc open a terminal and run ```subl --version``` @zybzzc if all else fails you could do https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/revert.html  -- **warning!:** all of your settings and other stuff will be gone... (backup/copy folder would be a good idea) glad it worked out hi yeah that\\'s pretty much the same thing @zybzzc .... though i primarily use brackets  a more hackish approach could be using sed (with regex) to find and replace (with wrapped tags) -- this would be static/hard coded and done externally at the file level.... @evaderei you can actually run bash stuff from node very... from what i\\'ve seen so far (that\\'s good and bad) @felfel is that row nested in a column? @felfel are you using bootstrap? @felfel if you\\'re looking at responsiveness for your page.... you may want to look at how the grid system works (i\\'m making a lot of assumptions here, not seeing the project) welcome @harshithachidanand and @arunkumarramanan  @nfatah what\\'s the name of the challenge/exercise? amazon seems to love to spam me with emails.... but, i can\\'t figure out why they do it at 3 or 6 am (seems really bold) like not only are we spamming you, but we also don\\' t care if we wake you  nan i think the latter is closer to the truth (in terms of their approach) nan nan i\\'m not chinese it\\'s difficult nan nvm lol copy /paste welcome @wjisaacs  the dips and spikes in activity are really interesting to watch hi, @abhisekp --- this is larry from (insert trial service here). we\\'ve noticed that you\\'re enjoying our stuff; however, sadly -- it\\'s time to pay up. unless you\\'ve opened to full window... then you can close tab or ```/bailtheheckoutofthisaddictivegitterstuff``` works too quitting your job as a motivator is insane is your friend fond of eating? i wasn\\'t following the convo that closely.... but in that case, i would say -less insane but not a good idea (imo) nan which is sad because mordor was one of the wealthiest mordors in the region <  100 yrs ago how long do you have to wait now? @jbmartinez  i\\'ve never been on so chat (didn\\'t even know they (despite going to so like 99% of the world) had one)  yeah, different vibe over there on so you should give grumpy cat some extra points for going the extra mile (i will do it on your behalf ) thanks @0x0936  @kadroff challenges with ```*``` are required but how much of a jump are you wanting to make? there\\'s no php in the curriculum depends, are you fairly proficient in js? ok, @kadroff i\\'d say do the basic js part of the curriculum before you jump to other more advanced stuff (it builds on previous lessons) @bapeshark there are couple of folks (or more) that are versed in php who might be able to help (but again, not php centric room/curriculum (i.e., js stack)) up to you @kadroff only things with ```*``` are required no, but i should that\\'s actually a good reminder that\\'s what i\\'m thinking too.... (employers drive a lot of this in indirect ways) @abhisekp never refers to me as \\'fellow indian\\' what\\'s up with that? you know of course that india is a big place and it could have a region called durham i will open a ticket to gitterhq to correct this obvious regional oversight  ma has a lot it seems @aswathm78 maybe http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/ .... or iframe ick indeed... that\\'s why bootstrap was higher in priority  yep pure css ... however, the rough sketch (literally) and \"magic\" comment made me think that pure css would be problematic i love the \\'poo poo\\' ng of the suggestions though hi @aswathm78 do you mean an internal link or you want the button to change into a box with stuff in it? also, where is this coming from ? @aswathm78 that may be a bad example.. because, the help button in fcc is attached to sidecar (pull out window) that shows chat window are you talking about an anchor? nerd hello back :smile:  @aswathm78 your sketch looks pretty basic (a sidebar menu) you\\'re essentially going to be linking to stuff internally or externally --- that example is a template with deadlinks so, you\\'d put actual links (look at the page source or inspect element) to make it work @aswathm78 question though.... do you really need a sidebar nav with a tribute page? watch the original jurassic park i\\'m usually slow to adopt \\'whatever movie\\' part \\'whatever\\' -or- a movie redo.... but dark knight eclipses the 80s version  (apples to oranges...sure, but still better) blues traveler hosted by o\\'reilly i can check  what video is it brb @sludge256 i\\'m in a noisy environment; however, he doesn\\'t says *don\\'t use css* he says *this is just stock bootstrap, no custom css* (paraphrasing)  auto-correct, evil or not evil? nan what business?  oh, i think i saw that in good fellas  i agree, seems beyond the grasp of my understanding that would happen @sludge256  did you fully exhaust ie6\\'s possibilities?  @thenumber40 welcome. i like your style \"they\" how much coffee have you had today, @maakux  oh, that\\'s me ^ yeah what cup? i see a rastafarian lion it\\'s a play on lorem ipsum  @lindeltsmith rookie questions benefit more folks when done in main chat you would think that taco bell would have a good selection of music yeah, i\\'d agree with corrections offered - one thing too: it\\'s kind of terse (different from brevity ) hmmm @r00t1000 where did you get that from (those flags look like old batch command flags) and npm install what? (could be anything in a package.json file) also, it\\'s deleting ..... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24276281/batch-file-not-in-silence-mode-del-s-q-f-file is it a legit repo? ~ will usually take you home hang on doh @r00t1000 i\\'m looking at the overall project (appears to do with steam logins etc)... for the two batch files. my guess would be that it\\'s not intentionally malicious.... but i\\'d be wary of running a batch file with del (everything in any folder).... because it looks like the author kind of added it as an afterthought (to his/her project). you don\\'t know what the environment path is .....  (again, i\\'m a linux person ) --  what\\'s not working? no is it free? oooh what, i\\'m not gonna be a hackthon distributor  hmm sounds :fish:  yeah, me too hmm there\\'s a security thing tomorrow for ms - freebie- really? didn\\'t your trial credit run out @abhisekp  where\\'s the live stream? (i\\'m getting a lot of stuff uploaded >= 3 hours thanks @sludge256  i think link 2 is a winner -- current: = \\'floyd marinescu\\' tos they\\'re angry that their name sounds like igor  what\\'s with the 70\\'s open shirt thing on hacksummit  yeah, watching kasriel.... but again what\\'s with the other guy (i\\'m assuming roman/founder) .... \\'s shirt? i have to do audio only on this hackthon what? i\\'m watching kasriel (first link is current slot)  oh, yeah, yeah sorry **summit** **summit** still, there are some things where audio only is an advantage this guy\\'s shirt is annoying me for some reason yeah yeah,  @jbmartinez i know who he reminds me of.... it\\'s an amalgam  he\\'s a cross between adam sandler and zorg in the 5th element i\\'ve decided that the summit does not demand live viewing and... i am going to minimize the window... when i eventually *listen* to said summit @alicejiang1 you\\'re very close to the way he looks ... but the lip pursing is very much gary oldman\\'s \\'zorg\\' for whatever reason i\\'m having a negative reaction to this guy i think @abhisekp is \\'all in\\' the summit now i feel bad, the previous guy said java is good to have a/c = air-conditioner  @alicejiang1 what\\'s your immediate reaction to said person? don\\'t think just say doppelganger  hey  not too bad @rafase282 how are you doing? @alicejiang1 yes, same here you\\'re streaming now? @stilltoni no if it\\'s too late for you i\\'m screwe^ @tony9464 blender has a serious learning curve (but is a neat program) https://www.blender.org/support/user-community/ yeah, i messed around with it yes, @eiselems css is evil hmm evil pure evil @abhisekp has certain talents  and loves to expose exploits (i really think he\\'d have a good future in information security in addition to what he\\'s doing on dev end) ( @abhisekp  ) take it lol .... i\\'m not surprised @combsco if you don\\'t take it you\\'ll be writing routines ( or sprocs)  that have select at the bottom - and an oracle backend they do .sh  is a script wait, hissing banana?  wtf is that two elements in a url i typically avoid (ok three) hissing, banana, and anything that has a script extension  nan ok, fine i will visit the hissing banana ...  wish me luck @combsco you\\'re using elixir? @combsco  @rafase282 \\'s stream got me thinking about this too.... i\\'m doing a node based tut with passport .... on  c9 doh,  @rafase282  how do you like streaming in general ? that\\'s a good plan ...kind of getting yourself ready  i had to turn the video for the summit off @bulbar help somebody doh @arielleslie  is going soft sigh i think so lol i don\\'t like full weekday names in formatting or names at all  blech.... lol @combsco see that\\'s better that you can do offsets pretty easy.... but it still is formatted as \\'friday\\' don\\'t do it:  @combsco is a cult leader for (a cult called) oracle   see how well he\\'s trained to throw out confusing words that is a good omen  wait... ok, nvm yeah, that means something else @swoozeki shhh white butterflies are pretty @combsco my pinky can\\'t escape the pull of the enter key ok, ...pale white is ok no, there\\'s a whole range you missed the ending part of that url is so personalized  ahoy yeah, i was thinking what\\'s the logic employed for that :chicken:  *\"must have experience in react especially in facebook react\"* i thought this was funny maybe they meant non react native  or something what are peaceful games? no, it was in polish i would have been like \"you brought me here to tell me i\\'m under qualified\"? are you really that much of an ass****? some of the tests (haven\\'t taken js based yet) are stuff you\\'d never see in production (interview tests) i\\'m like \"what?\" again, i\\'ve said this at least three times in the last month.... but this is the secret: one page resume -in sharpie- \"me makey stuff.... you pay me stuff, me get a long with everybody, and i no smelly, let\\'s talk\" a: what part of node would you like me to explain?...tell me about your production environment @combsco tell me about threading @spatzerny :thumbsup:  @combsco  as your interviewer i\\'m wearing a blindfold don\\'t ask why.... we\\'re good people here later i will be practicing ninja star throwing as part of the interview process, please see our pre interview questionnaire  should you have any questions @combsco  @combsco where do you see yourself in 50 years? @rogue00 if you were in another plane would you a: still complete the project or b: go to the light? @rogers187 not sure am following @rogers187 do you mean a separate panel (or panels) (aka images) to link to each project? i like that setup ok hang on @rogers187  @rogers187 i think you need to move your stuff inside the anchor (example:\\n```\\n <a href=\"http://codepen.io/rogers187/pen/rrobkx\"class=\"target_blank\"><u>here is some of my work, with more to come</u></a>\\n``` now this will bork your styling @sludge256 i actually have always wanted one of those tower carriers (no joke) omg that is the most beatiful product i\\'ve ever seen (wipes away tears).... is that a **real** backpack tower carrier? nan nan functional how? yeah it does have kind of a dominos on the run look (tower carrier) how come there aren\\'t any titles of her books? yeah, no way i think they misread the narrative in the matrix @carpetdog nah, looks good :shipit:  i appreciate that (which isn\\'t a bad approach because, really you can tweak something forever) mr. burns @rogers187 but you didn\\'t make your link valid hmm actually the guy who did that portfolio got a dev job... (he actually used to be in this chat ) @rogers187 you have to fix your link first semantik is good for that (in the ubuntu repos)  map away and report back it\\'s evil nan no joke nan lag serious lag on thy gitter no (that would be too obvious) we all know that gitter was designed for small dev teams of 40,000 people or more what? they have that many employees? zorg i\\'m not, the shirt thing lost all credibility  same here yeah, i could do that stream nan nan ok, i might talk a bit nan meh my time isn\\'t free yeah, i might give it another chance.... but i\\'m not starstruck by this stuff wat @mikzat what did you find interesting @combsco hack summit  @mikzat so, when i jumped on .... they were talking about their slack usage @combsco yeah @rogers187 i\\'m not bored but sure  wait, @combsco says he\\'s bored you said you\\'re bored it\\'s css time yeah, and netflix lol sample of \\'compelling\\' hacker summit... person 1: yeah, we (dev) usually talk around 11:00am and found it\\'s optimum... person 2: yeah, don\\'t you find that there\\'s a flow?\"  welcome @jbmartinez  i welcomed you  i said hi she mentioned that she\\'s flying back to u.s. @ianakiara did you make the pen anonymous because it\\'s a tribute to bob marley? btw....  the original version of \\'one love\\' was more ska  the citations don\\'t have active links awesome @dmitrikonnikov  it\\'s a grid paradigm meant to rob you of all creativity  although, i\\'m getting used to it.... (this scares me a little) night welcome @arhillis  nice... i didn\\'t know fcc was mentioned (i didn\\'t watch the whole thing) what\\'s a helmed warrior @rogue00  meh codecademy (imo) borked their transition to tiered services. also, i found their basic js to be lacking @rogue00 i don\\'t think there\\'s a \\'helmed\\' warrior is that an actual word? ok, is it a word in the helmeted context? @rogue00 it looks as though it meets user story requirements.... i\\'d center stuff though (everything is left justified with a lot of white space in multiple viewports) you\\'d be surprised how much things like grammar can torpedo a good page yeah, probably not super popular down this way wow, switching from that pen back to pure white background ... made me dizzy i haven\\'t seen xtc mentioned in many moons  i\\'m not but i live in the south depends. hang on yeah that\\'s what i\\'m looking at.... you don\\'t have any containers, columns or rows etc. if you just center stuff..... (without columns) it ends up looking weird @rogue00 you\\'re presented with a choice i mean i think it will pass as is but.... awesome checkout bootstrap docs.... and familiarize with grid. if not the bootstrap route, check sites like css-tricks http://getbootstrap.com/css/ https://css-tricks.com/ i have to add that i (like a lot of other people (if they\\'re honest)) underestimated css welcome @suvreial and @praveen-sambu  yeah, that is a pretty good (and straightforward) grid example. depends on the context http://nerds.airbnb.com/mysql-in-the-cloud-at-airbnb/ @chrisdziewa don\\'t know.... i was going to say (millage may vary) but i got stuck on the rapid fire questions so, let\\'s slow down a bit @praveen-sambu  relational databases (sql) are different from no-sql (e.g., mongodb)  the former is typically broken down by entity relationships (separate tables pk/fk keys that sort of thing) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codd%27s_12_rules the latter (no-sql) is more of a document model that scales well.... https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained (there\\'s a whitepaper you can download) mongoose doesn\\'t supplant mongo it\\'s used in conjunction with node and mongo...... ( i was going through a tut that actually used mongoose yesterday... still learning this though) my background is more in relational stuff and that\\'s my comfort zone  - but am a least learning about the dark side (no sql) so let me ask you have you googled this? please tell me yes lol nan welcome @nabendu82  i think that\\'s also a track to (paid) cert  if you want to go \\'all in\\' with mongo the learning part is free.... but the cert has a fee associated not a bad deal yeah, you can get the knowledge free i was thinking about that graphic (seen it a couple of times) where\\'d you grab it from? yeah that\\'s more succinct.... my thing is demands are different... so it\\'s not apples to apples in some (many cases) it depends mongodb.... is good at json type stuff... this is not super complex data but scales well.... relational databases aren\\'t going to disappear  @praveen-sambu again it\\'s context what kind of relationships? @praveen-sambu so how much capital do you have to start this airbnb like site? because all the talk of scaling is in itself academic because having that kind of traffic is probably not an issue you\\'re going to have starting out, no? ^good point their pricing isn\\'t bad yeah, there\\'s a freebie tier... but part of the discussion was sql vs. no-sql 30 @praveen-sambu what are you using as a db now? have you mapped out what kind of data you\\'re going to capture? transactions, etc., as well  hey, that\\'s the dude from pbs i remember that show i think i watched that and autoweek  @praveen-sambu it\\'s sounds like the general direction that you\\'ve taken is no-sql (which may be appropriate for your situation or not)... what gave you second thoughts, in terms of factoring in a relational db into the equation? cra^ low on coffee i knew i forgot something yeah, cause now i\\'m thinking.... nan but i wake up if i don\\'t have enough caffeine  (odd as it sounds) yeah, it\\'s true nan nan it waved at me, and i was like wow wait, that\\'s total recall  what was that thing called yes! nan wait, that\\'s arnold on mars nan nan nan but no, actually arnold\\'s disguise mask was the best a lot of the futuristic stuff in that movie doesn\\'t seem so futuristic now oh sweet i haven\\'t heard *palm* in so long i want my blackberry back, ftw yeah, i\\'d chicken out on a blackberry (anything) purchase these days.... oh, nice  true, but that comes with a lot of risk what about bluetooth albeit slow one @thaniri try adding target=\"_blank\" (to make it open in a new tab) hackish but i tested it and it worked (though i see you have a hard coded test url currently attached to that button cats make the internet go round ```_blank``` ^underscore yeah, i didn\\'t see @jayv30  \\'s post he/she should get the thanks would be an interesting case of brownie damages however, @jayv30 \\'s attorney would likely take 50% of his single brownie so, brownie settlement might be an option but wait-wait... there was no damage as he got a brownie  omg hello we\\'re not bots promise actually i was testing my answer in his pen so i was off screen or her pen work stuff, and learning js/doing the curriculum  yeah, although i do get sidetracked on tuts if something interests me among all the things so far i\\'ve encountered node keeps calling me \"hey, i\\'m node.... you like me don\\'t you?\" no. \"oh, come on....\" sqlite3 ? i dunno i don\\'t do any mobile stuff but do use that in batch scripts sometimes... for non-heavy stuff (lite) nan you\\'re building something within the construct of a program (you\\'re not really building anything but selecting from options) nan @rogue00  maybe react native is what you\\'re after (i\\'m not looking forward to react) (difficult)  eclipse is java yeah....  @anthonygallina1 is into java (and eating fresh rabbits) he could chime in on this don\\'t use the ones that have different color eyes  welcome @bitroger  welcome @ljoseph13 jump in (not here but the actual curriculum) and make it happen here (gitter) is sort of a purgatory  nan nan i\\'m just kidding.... if you need any help this is a great place  https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/official-free-code-camp-chat-rooms they took away cabinetry  wtf build cabinets... varnish .... that kind of thing  @wasong yes however only those challenges with ```*``` are required wait what? np @rogue00 if you have evangelists amassing an army outside your house learning mobile is the least of your problems he could summon yanni  nan hay :sparkles:  i\\'m getting the lingo now..... no, time for \\'hey\\' @abhisekp i think that looks pretty good i was thinking the same thing (text within the nav or box)..... i think the person that had the original sketch was talking about links  @abhisekp i like the vegas sky @abhisekp it gave you a parse error first..... i didn\\'t know gitter could display that in chat yes, i did  @abhisekp i don\\'t really know how to get the buttons over to the right (all the absolute this and that so stuff didn\\'t work) so, just did a hackish -px https://jsfiddle.net/2lfb48dp/ out of my comfort zone with pure css (getting comfy with bootstrap but that\\'s bad (i think) so...) don\\'t mind hacking away until the right way presents itself @abhisekp  that\\'s what you wanted, no? are you telling me that\\'s **not** what you wanted ok, fine.... what was the requirement again? nan yeah, but i thought in your earlier comments you said something like \"too bad i can\\'t get the buttons to the right\".... (yeah, the guy\\'s sketch was buttons on the left) yes, and i saw the subtle highlighting around the font (kudos) am i dreaming this? i\\'m too lazy to scroll do it you will learn more by showing what you got (even if you look like an a^^) don\\'t be afraid i\\'m not talking about projects what? i am getting low on coffee... my point is stretch beyond your comfort zone face palm @abhisekp looks like bob has the answer did you view source? or inspect element? on that?

(midori) lol i did something similar with an ancient netbook (specs aren\\'t really that different from a pi) what kind of memory do those have? @sludge256 yep, exactly (mem wise) as the netbook project.... really struggles  from bears shame on you :metal:  actually thinking back to one of @spatzerny \\'s posts.... it\\'s the first time i\\'ve been given \"the bird\" from an actual bird no, i mean that  in a good way like very creative @dylandknight how did you get the green effect? i\\'ve had this problem as well no actually turning green nan @storbeck avoid designers at all costs how\\'d the move go? wow that\\'s seriously efficient move  explain format ooh nice.... (btw what kind of switch do you have on the double monitor hookup to laptop? foreground) yeah, i assumed both of those monitors where plugged to lap see that\\'s what i\\'m trying to get around (for laptop) i don\\'t want a kvm..... i can use dual monitor and drag stuff around, but adding a third with same functionality woudl be cool yeah have an hdmi output.... but for the cheapy (my likely case)  3rd  monitor probably no hdmi input brackets and geany (sometimes sublime) nan nan gitter log: *this message was deleted* i\\'m looking forward to sass.... sass pastafarian? nan yeah i can\\'t go pastafarian: it\\'s incompatible with my sacred :chicken:  it\\'s not polite to ask that lol he is totally don\\'t get @combsco started on laravel... he has the poster and everything yeah, that was kind of weird @abhisekp have you started messing with sass yet? gd nooo that\\'s the whole point of the course (to take it).. you will get plenty o\\' plenty of js here i assure you no, it\\'s just that js evolved .... if you\\'re looking at it from a late 90s perspective you\\'re in for a shock actual paper i have the loudest owls where i live good grief they don\\'t even wait until the sun fully sets **g**ood **d**oritos i like that however, the :chicken: doesn\\'t approve :chicken:  they were not referencing google drive no you weren\\'t what @combsco are you trying to animate that ? oh people probably are more apt to help if they sense that you value their time depends on the context and scope i can mentor you in hand modeling @jbmartinez  but you must promise not to give away trade secrets @rphares wanted to go down the hand modeling route; however, i think she\\'s not cut out for it (too nice in a very mean business). shhhh don\\'t tell her. nice... what are you escaping to? @mosaic-greg reporting is good stuff congrats shhhhh you are soooooo nice yeah, d3 is interesting stuff wait, i have to show  you both (again) where you\\'re at now vs. where you can be in hand modeling @rphares and @jbmartinez  brb wait, my hand modeling mentoring materials are on my laptop..... nice try at contrived meanness   @jbmartinez and @rphares i know that you\\'ve seen this \\'chart\\' before however, i feel that repetition is important in all things (especially hand modeling) are you ready? nan you both are very much in the before category @jbmartinez and @rphares  but it\\'s ok.... i\\'m here for you i\\'m just gonna leave that for a few more seconds so that it can sink in nín hǎo howdy @jackel27  what? i always go for more formal greeting @zerelt did you get the pen (vs. jsbin) sorted out? @zerelt i can see why this is making you crazy (went down the same red herrings in codepen) only thing seems to be console output (take a look) maybe it\\'s http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30465651/passing-keys-to-children-in-react-js - but no clue i want to be like @combsco  @zerelt i knew there was a reason why i had apprehension for the react part of course...lol  or have pretty hands (always the hand model) yes, haven\\'t *heard that* before i want to be known for my coding skills, not my pretty hands #3. is the best if i were a hiring mgr, i\\'d hire you @combsco  yeah that\\'s great they\\'re interested or they wouldn\\'t waste the time you have to give them a non standard response nan nan that\\'s the hand model approach might not work in other sectors oh, bad that\\'s \\'the question\\' for me.... i\\'m like \\'flat\\' no. yeah, i\\'d have gone for st. pete too at least you\\'re not in jacksonville @combsco you\\'re going to do ok.  how is this possible @rphares do you greet everybody gitter is a resource pig oink gitter oink there\\'s even a snout pane @lawlietblack are you \\'settling\\' for coding? tisk a lot of abstract math makes my head hurt  not my thing that sucks what is ? you don\\'t have to @rphares you are so nice... what the he^^ is wrong with you? lol it is when i did my hello w....

(your latter example happens to evaluate nicely into 0.35) @johnqq i\\'m (still) going with tofixed on this b/c even though you\\'re using number it\\'s still the same https://repl.it/bpnn/1 @nickelghost are you talking about the editor ? i think it\\'s codemirror @nickelghost maybe jade (but don\\'t quote me ) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=jade @nickelghost it\\'s express; however, don\\'t know if it\\'s express *with* ejs (you can take a look at the map) @nickelghost i\\'d say poke around a bit... click a link or two since they use jade in the actual project (as well as at the exercises at user level ) and point to https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks (which again, i understand the distinction there - thanks) in the exercises, i\\'d say jade @nickelghost  @ukurochka clearly you\\'re not  :smile:  how could you be what you say in your introduction (\"stupid idiot\" and i\\'m quoting you) if you\\'ve taken the first step to learning something, @ukurochka ? this doesn\\'t seem to be \\'idiot\\' behavior. @codemzy you changed your avatar @khalysi this sounds like the undocumented bootstrap class \\'makespacey\\' @frdmn i don\\'t no.... but humor can be dicey over different languages @kekau92 looks good. i\\'d add another (outer) wikipedia link(main)  (in addition to the sound file) hiya @huanga1  me too... they added it after i started @jbmartinez did you figure out the mixed content .psd from non ps (opening)? ok, let me check... (i totally forgot) :worried:  @jbmartinez yeah, there are subtle things that just \\'won\\'t happen\\' in a lot of utilities. you can run older versions of ps in wine.... i haven\\'t attempted new.... does adobe still have actual evaluation trial download - ? (maybe that might work) - trial, convert, happy-happy. not sure why gimp wouldn\\'t work (would check some boards on that).... but i\\'m still thinking imagemagick would convert (but you\\'re not going to retain layers) @jbmartinez total roll of the dice but, http://superuser.com/questions/471446/take-a-psd-and-export-all-the-layers-into-separate-image-files-without-using-pho -- check the last answer (never used this tool but...just ideas) :sweat_drops:  @arielleslie you\\'re not *one of those office people* that leaves balloons (with helium) around until they hang half way from the top of cubicle to floor are you? @arielleslie demand refund do it @arielleslie  but.... she/he might notice their balloon next to your work area that could get dicey oh, so it\\'s not a personalized balloon (e.g., happy birthday larry)... that might work then nan nan i mean that is brilliant (my new approach) ^ :thumbsup:  nan i am so not joking nan me too oh, i can summarize nan nan @khalysi does it have led light? (fan) @khalysi oh, that\\'s different (it\\'s a cpu fan) yeah... those are fun to mess with *never* try to remove one with a cold board yeah i think you said tower fan (usually can be a mix of things like big fans, little fans etc., that control air flow through the box itself) here\\'s a fun experiement take a really old monitor (ones that despite any settings have a dingy white appearance on screen) and place it next to a modern display ..... you\\'ll get dizzy after awhile  yeah my main dual setup is modern + modern... but i got the dumb idea of taking an old monitor and experimenting --- really messed up my vision for about 1/2 hour yeah, one thing about macs is their displays are sharp as he^^ (one thing i can\\'t harp on mac about ) @leecroydon are you certain that you\\'ve implemented it correctly ? @leecroydon cool @leecroydon it looks good i resized it in browser and ran through a simulator (a lame online one but still) .... and nav has expected behavior in terms of sizing  did i miss something? ok, hang on let me check @leecroydon  @brianamarie :smile: haven\\'t seen you in awhile  @leecroydon  the links work (in simulator) but the nav (in pancake) extends to a lot of the viewport so it\\'s not that they\\'re not necessarily working... but you may not be able to see the content below (are you seeing a browser scroll apart from the nav?). michael jackson was a boxer too? @leecroydon did you see my previous comment? @leecroydon ok, let me look at it on an actual apple device (vs. simulator ) brb wait, that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to do @leecroydon (hamburger) you don\\'t get a dropdown? when you click that button i\\'m going to re-post your pen link so i can grab it off of here @leecroydon \\nhttp://codepen.io/leecroydon/full/lgwnvb @leecroydon i think it has something to do with codepen (with iphone)... it has a demo \\'frame\\' (i.e., the codepen page itself) surrounding your  demo. so, if you scroll you\\'re not getting an actual real view of the behavior because the fixed nav scrolls too. i don\\'t have the answer .... but i\\'d google pens and iphone (sorry...) dc isn\\'t cheap oh, that dc lol because dc metro property values are insane @abhisekp hover over my avatar ok now hover over my avatar yes, we\\'re proud here in malibu india lol not all certs are equal @sludge256 that is a good cert @rphares you haven\\'t given me any valuable feedback for project: elvis re-animator  not costello no, but reanimate is probably the wrong word... i need to clone elvis nan @rphares thoughts? how long does that take the projects will help in that department (learning / reinforcement ) oh, great there\\'s a tornado watch for my area ~~malibu~~ durham hope i don\\'t end up in really ugly shoes with a house landing on the bad witch (there really is a tornado warning though...sucks) thank you @rphares for erm both  i\\'m going to go with not red and glittery though yeah to where is the concern yeah, no... if you wear red glittery shoes you\\'re probably going to be teleported to the bad side of town with equally tacky dress.  so, i\\'ll take my chances with tornado  <----sidesteps fashion debate\\'s third rail  @geperezg don\\'t worry this isn\\'t aol is that python?

(from my interactions with said.. folks) remember us @alicejiang1 i think you have a point.. maybe a hybrid technical/client facing role would work for you (you\\'re articulate and have a good sense of humor).... i\\'d say pass on the recruiting but that\\'s just my opinion  yeah and never remove heatsink on a cold board the paste turns to glue and you know just how many pins are on the cpu welcome @rigaac  and @jklmnop23  omg my favorite movie programmer is newman (he will always be known as that no matter what) in jurasic park (original) ever seen seinfeld? nerd cage match did gitter change something? ....i got taken to \\'hey explore stuff and you can download stuff when i logged into this room\" you need a good pro wrestling name @abhisekp  junkyard-pi-kp rowdy-roddy-abhisekep-**pi**(e)per no, that doesn\\'t work....doesn\\'t have enough of a pro wrestling feel to it we have to take abhisekp out of the ring name is cricket like hockey without the ice? lol welcome @sandypam  i\\'m just looking at the cricket stick things... reminds me of hockey which a civilized sport indeed so, both games are kind of like a piñata then? hmmm so, are there cricket leagues? i did.  apparently cricket is a very loud bug @lizardbrains what are you having trouble with? ok link the codepen link paste it here and it will embed  @lizardbrains why do you have scss enabled (doesn\\'t look sass like ) @lizardbrains you\\'re not doing any pre-processing disable that and it will render @qmikew1 notes @jbmartinez \\'s queston @lizardbrains also, i see the humor in the pen/approach ....but there was a minute where i thought it was rogue code no let\\'s step back for a second let me go back to my original comment, i wasn\\'t saying to enable sass.... i was saying to disable scss (the sass like comment was confusing sorry about that)... you\\'re doing plain css... @lizardbrains  but your question \"doesn\\'t fcc use.....\" @lizardbrains .....was just wondering how you made the jump to scss? (i know you\\'ve got it all sorted out and everything) btw @rphares how\\'s it going ok lol i\\'m not being helpful.... i think i\\'m being confusing which is the opposite hey ok the question sprout consumption check @rphares  hmmm i\\'m going to help you with your sprout withdraw symptoms welcome @jabunga  that actually sounds good except the fiber don\\'t know what that\\'s about only those with ```*``` are required but what\\'s with the bran thing do you eat it with everything? @scrufflynx dude good choice (and nice work) @rphares what? it\\'s worse than i thought no gasp sure @pandoriummmm  @pandoriummmm you want to paste the code explain format @combsco you need batteries for what? @pandoriummmm paste all of the code @pandoriummmm ok, good job getting the code into chat... what\\'s the name of the challenge (i think i know the name....but don\\'t want to guess) @pandoriummmm look at the example  in the left pane.....(still with me?) ok, if you look at the example think of it this way... they want you to nest what\\'s currently in the editor to what\\'s between ><  so: what would you put between ```<form action=\"/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data\"></form>```? (also, you\\'d have to change it to: ```action=\"/submit-cat-photo``` but go with the main idea first right that would be nested in the form action stuff might look like ```<form action=\"/submit-cat-photo\">nestsomestuffhere</form>``` ok, that\\'s the example with literal stuff... you have to replace it with actual url let\\'s try again.... nest what you have in editor within this: ```<form action=\"/submit-cat-photo\">nestsomestuffhere</form>``` \"nestsomestuffhere\" would be ```<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"cat photo url\">``` nice rock on :metal:  oh, wait.... @khalysi not as vars though @pandoriummmm  they\\'re just getting you used to the syntax of things. form actions are beyond the scope of that particular exercise (later you\\'ll learn more) but for now maybe http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_action.asp @combsco buy cupcakes for said seasoned colleague @pandoriummmm you\\'ll do fine. just keep at it  @qmikew1 notes that @rphares likes to keep me off balance @qmikew1 by being nice @alicejiang1 are you replying this presentation in your mind she\\'s totally mean to me what\\'s the definition of success ( @rphares in this context) ? ohhhhhh yes, you\\'ve come a long very well but.. @rphares  @greenandblue654 why are you thanking everybody no brownies should be earned (even though there\\'s no real value to those) lol irony  oh, lord @lagger-camp that\\'s the most succinct styling critique i\\'ve heard (in this context). lol @lagger-camp the answer is no. but i think there are some extension that allow you to change background color (chrome) @qmikew1 wonders which hideous hand nan @qmikew1 wonders if @rphares has gone into sprout coma later @jbmartinez  where\\'s my ad money @danjfletcher i get correct weather.... but in jquery it looks like you intended to show an image that relates to current conditions...  @sludge256  a problem i should have i wish current conditions (in my city) were in the 70+ range winter stinks and so do wrong numbers waking me from my slumber welcome @longbeach  lag check wat :wave:  x2 :metal:  looks like a depends outer garment that\\'s seriously ugly clothing no, you could hold 180 days worth i\\'m sure no please no please don\\'t play into the nerd stereotypes hmmm @kylepeeler everybody is different ....but i\\'d start with the challenges from start -> completion of basic js ..at that point you\\'ll probably want to dig into js a little more deeply ..start with http://eloquentjavascript.net/   (also, fcc does react (your second question)) no machines will learn then were\\'s screwed nan is that guy playing tetris? what\\'s that is it a beeper  would that be a mirror or an oyster shell welcome @master54321  red or blue isn\\'t that a bug in beginning state oh wait @rphares  nan i know....

(there are more)) yes i log out of course you don\\'t log out? i\\'ve never seen myself no i get that i\\'m talking about me that moose must have some serious dry eyes welcome @moosecantblink  @shiv921 yes i haven\\'t completed the certs, but there are people who have @shiv921 i think the market place will determine that... fcc is pretty new so, it\\'s kind of tough to answer that welcome @raokikrishnan  nan if you want to broaden the topic a bit .... different certs (imo) carry different weight @fikriloniamus relational or no-sql? or both @fikriloniamus hmmm there are a number of ways, i\\'d first start learning sql (there are free courses)... if you want to delve into theory i think there are also free online university courses, - but just setting up maybe your own mysql or ms sql db and messing around is probably a good start.... relational wise, you probably want to know this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codd%27s_12_rules wait you said you wanted relational now you change your mind fine... try mongodb university know the difference first though @leinadp but you\\'ll lose pmi cert (just kidding) one thing that sucks is academic credentials and certs don\\'t (really imo) have any bearing on who or what makes somebody a good -insert whatever here- but, it\\'s hr people and machines that are the gatekeepers in a lot contexts can\\'t always discount this stuff... just sayin he roped you into a hard fee lol @leinadp go and \\'be free\\' :smile:  @leinadp i actually thought about going down that road... so i\\'ve looked at the requirements etc. it\\'s pretty involved (real hours etc.)... but when you\\'ve decided that you want to do something else...just do it (there will be a comfort level drop for a while i think... but that\\'s always there) don\\'t fear the reaper  @leinadp oh, you\\'re hardcore you\\'ll do fine then @spatzerny another walken \\'gem\\' is from pulp fiction (however, not appropriate for this room lol) yes and now i give it to you yeah, but paragraph #2 (which was omitted (good choice) is where it gets funnier)) wow @johnnycooper looks great (functionality is all there).... only thing i\\'d offer is there should be an event that clears the default text on enter/over/click whatever..... because you have to delete that text to search also, @johnnycooper i think there should be an octopus in the crystal ball... (but this is all subjective) lol good job @7speter i think @frdmn is thinking ahead a bit (not just answering your immediate question) might be worthwhile to checkout how the grid works (imo....some loathe bootstrap) with good reason in many cases yeah, there are less \\'strappy\\' versions of it.... i\\'ve been reading through some stuff \\' no it\\'s you (90% you (us) ) but that\\'s an actual terminal (be it ubuntu thrown onto c0) c9 why not copy paste into a local file then invoke node on it (with console.log()\\'s peppered throughout) i don\\'t think the aim is to have a fully functional tool (really (imo) you should be transitioning to your own tools (techniques.... you can stay in terminal all you want on your own dev box)  this is more for instruction how so nan dang keyboard purple octopus :+1:  don\\'t know no pressure there @mikepeiman  welcome @zachalewel what\\'s your queston you can pull image into gitter drag @jamesdimi depends on your end goal (define that first)  that\\'s an er diagram with primary and foreign keys  @zachalewel https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagram-symbols-and-meaning oh, whoops didn\\'t see your second image hang on  @zachalewel so i see you have count desc (that would work) but i see an inner join (maybe left or right as case may be) would be better? on inventory that is @zachalewel  still around? your (key) path looks sound... why not group by on rental date? and film_id (sorry trying to follow the er diagram) right but the number of rental dates paired to the film_id would give you a count  the film_id (and its path (or relationship) back to category table (i.e., your genre alias) would be the route (at least from what i see without any actual data to play with) - to the rental dates. you can get its popularity from the number of rental dates (group by again ) paired to category.id, category.name (omit category.id from columns though) backtick is left of 1 key top row (us keyboards) explain format you have to paste the code in between the backticks (like a sandwich) nan yeah, i did that a long time ago, (notice the brown icon vs green) @zachalewel there are a couple of options  are you just trying to get the stats as an ad hoc thing? or do you have this paired to some sort of web front end? or...are you trying to create a report based on that statement no @zachalewel one more thing ... if you\\'re going to do a group by on rental return date you\\'re going to need to format it first (from table def looks like a timestamp field) @zachalewel don\\'t know what dialect this (maybe you\\'re using mysql).... but if it\\'s a one time thing (and it\\'s not part of a live interface (be it a report or frontend or both) you could do a group by (and formatting) on just the rental table and dump into a temp... table and then do the joins back to category based on that. (without seeing actual data, scope (and knowing your skillset) it might be difficult to give advice in this context......  @melanquince boostrap is suggested for ease of use very  you will get plenty of js i\\'d go with browser gitter not so great on mobile edit. gitter sucks on mobile @willtravelforfun yeah, but did you know the whole time you were using it there was a bunch of gibberish characters with every post? @willtravelforfun no. i\\'m kidding but it still sucks yeah tip: don\\'t wear motley crue shirt on skype interview yeah that\\'s a good tip also relational stuff isn\\'t going to disappear but no-sql can\\'t be ignored (if you look at ads you can see companies are starting to play with both (or a least dipping their toes in)) eh, depends on the complexity of the data..... not everything fits into a document store model hmm i\\'d look at normalization concepts @allanx2000 (that comment doesn\\'t make sense in the relational (sense)) @allanx2000 right i don\\'t think we\\'re talking about the same thing (in terms of what\\'s appropriate for no-sql vs. relational model) @effinawesome it\\'s a regional thing..... if the other was used, somebody else would then have the same comment  small talk? @willtravelforfun i\\'d say mirror  the person you\\'re assisting/serving. not everybody likes small talk. (some yep, some, nope) nan nan i\\'m pretty sure i\\'ve gotten zero done today i blame @sludge256  but the avocado was eaten for our..... wait.. mixed metaphor and totally the opposite these humans seem to use symbolic language and are fond of this: ``` ` ``` thing welcome @hnuur  can i \\'like\\' the avacado welcome @elmouad  sadly i think you\\'re right serious pickle who knew? yeah, i\\'m feeling out of touch lol yeah but they used \\'then\\' in place of \\'than\\' (no, no when insulting (even if by pickle)) speaking of welcome @rphares  nooo don\\'t say that to your mom (@rphares) oh, saw the edit \\'man\\' vs. \\'ma\\' no way <----retains \\'the figure\\' allthough old and crusty probably applies i first thought that i was being unproductive today; however, the pickle conversation changed my mind. be worried granny mine too it\\'s called roxanne  by the police you don\\'t have to put on that fb dress.... raaaaaaa (phonetic) ckssan.. you don\\'t have to ok, doesn\\'t translate to text well yeah i tried gasp what\\'s up with country restrictions on youtube other than authoritarian states i mean ugh @spat92 throw your code into repl.it (or paste it here)...... and folks will look at it wait? you\\'re not testing the individual items in the array, you\\'re not going to get a valid answer.- or filtering those based on a condition (would be a callback)  oh really class=\"class1 class2\" are you sure? your mojito was lost in transit note the avocado\\'s mouth (mojito destroyer) @qmikew1 wonders if chat logs retain avatar\\'s state at time of comment (because when sludge changes his avatar again, \\'mojito destroyer\\' will make no sense ok delete that hover over the ```...``` it\\'s not the url.... it\\'s the code (your code) that is needed class=\"class1 class2\".... so it might look like class=\"smaller-image thick-green-border\" ... did you create the thick-green-border class (and put stuff in it)? ok, post the code from the editor copy paste here (all of it) i would add the formatting bit ... but it\\'s not important at the moment you have class2 that\\'s wrong go back to my previous post > class=\"class1 class2\".... so it might look like class=\"smaller-image thick-green-border\" ... did you create the thick-green-border class (and put stuff in it)? yeah where\\'s our free stuff @theepdinker  what starbucks? you want me to visit? (zombie trance) well, yeah i did but it\\'s so fresh and tasty there they have wifi... too congrats :metal:  @alicejiang1 don\\'t take my seat or outlet you\\'ve already insulted my singing what? @blues003 yes keep going @blues003 everybody has their own learning style. i\\'d say that if you\\'re having trouble with a specific exercise (or as you go a long) ask a question here. (and research outside of the fcc website... it\\'s encouraged) not yet @aledwassell i use brackets yeah but me an @jbmartinez are characters and pixelated features how do you know we\\'re even humna err human humna is good too yoda i use kubuntu but plasma 5 was shipped too soon (a lot of broken cra^) ranch dressing is good too btw i told you mern is a :chicken: disease oracle loves you @combsco  i\\'ve learned not to \\'hate on (technologies)\\' really anything (except windows (just kidding)) -- employers have something (insert whatever) and need people to deal with that something and want to pay people for..... - so they drive it (it\\'s ok to be a tech wh**e) true @alicejiang1 you need a nickname you do ? but you have that as a nickname i\\'m thinking i can multi-task yes, you took over my body @combsco (i will be contacting a priest soon) learn whatever vendor stuff... you\\'re not selling your soul (in most cases) justkrautus @alicejiang1  yeah that\\'s good ok i\\'ll try again market demand and you i\\'m still working on the nickname hiya @rohitp01  i can\\'t now i\\'m on a nickname mission retry i have some schaum\\'s outlines with c++ and java (never really touched those, got em at a book sale) it\\'s like a language love connection? ot that was an errant keyboarding ty for that @combsco  it was worth the wall for me, really? what can i say?  @combsco hmm nan that was wrong lol i couldn\\'t help it @abhisekp did you fix the es6 arrows? nice but those coffee cups are expensive  k-cup f that @da7thsin do you have a pen? why not link it? is it sharpie @combsco  a* @da7thsin which part isn\\'t working for you? yeah, the correct pane thing is valid.... but in a nutshell what\\'s the expected behavior (and which element (a lot of colors there) @da7thsin  np that\\'s funny orange park is a place near jax fl welcome @orangepark  not snot near those are pretty easy utilities/commands in terminal  (or in bash) @da7thsin help me here... what do you want to see in your page (i.e., what do you see that is wrong or needs to be tweaked) do you want to center h3? @combsco i understand your gitter stats yeah, 74% oh why do you have this app? yes ok, @da7thsin  for your use? don\\'t you already instinctively know what you\\'re wasting time on? @da7thsin have you tried putting the background images in individual class @da7thsin background-image part is key http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp @combsco yeah i was going to say.... how are you still employed with that score lol ugh why do you need an app to tell you (in essence) \\'you suck, and you\\'re wasting too much time\\'? i mean it\\'s just validating what you (in whatever case) already know agree with that approach wait, you should **not** use imgur (it\\'s against their tos and they block images at times) or you can do that or use another service that\\'s not realistic? welcome @awan21clouds  ok it works @combsco see this software only makes you feel bad about yourself  it\\'s evil lol there are a lot awesome people here @awan21clouds (i\\'m not one) lol yeah, time trackers i don\\'t get thank you @anthonygallina1  now i must steal your brownies i agree that you should have benchmarks and general outlines of time to do stuff... but it\\'s finishing it (no matter how long it takes) is kind of where i come from @combsco what\\'s your goal? learning stuff @combsco  lol you can sometimes get locked into the efficiency trap (i.e., you\\'re meeting all of your self imposed criteria...yet, still feel wanting) grid without the \\'strappy-ness\\' not so bad welcome @chinuxparibus  wait, did you just \\'plug\\' your blog (just kidding) hi i am noob and want to make pretty things... @combsco please help my dream is to make a site about an elvis/octopus hybrid (octoelvis) no, octoelvis is my dream i suck but i can live with that lol one day octoelvis will help people with things like doing the dishes and singing to them while doing the dishes no, they stole my idea my glyph had tentacles and a 70s elvis outline @anthonya97 can you paste what you got? (probably best to format) explain format why @anthonya97 there\\'s some stuff missing there and  that has implications for classes that you\\'d apply to div and the stuff nested within @anthonya97 hmmm maybe a bug in there as an aside.... if you put your opening <div> tag above ```<h2 class=\"red-text\">catphotoapp</h2>``` it passes (contrary to instructions) https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/issues/7261 - not commenting on the validity but i see something different (the fact that it will pass if you put opening div above h2).... @anthonya97 up to you but it will pass if you place opening div above .. ok, i\\'m done i think the power of regex is being lost on small strings.... try thinking about it in terms of huge files yeah, that\\'s true but its real utility isn\\'t only in js implementations  yeah perl... awk i think is more powerful than sed... but i\\'m more comfortable with sed for whatever reason hiya @rexchip  heya dang salary and age  hey @akiralaine  howdy @akiralaine i modified your nickname for @alicejiang1  justkrautus alice + sour kraut no? justkrautus she doesn\\'t seem to be supportive of my nickname idea issues with pickled cabbage? i\\'ll have to dig deep for another nickname idea @colliedg while it\\'s true that classes are separated by spaces (e.g., class=\"class1 class2\" and you passed the challenge) i think the point was missed because ```$(\"button\").removeclass(\"btn-default\");``` targets **all** buttons without having to work so hard. rock on :smile:  cud = :cow2:  @melontest this is a javascript centric room..... (if you\\'re looking at native apps you\\'re probably thinking java..

(it does get easier don\\'t get me wrong)  from a consumer point of view.... i say (maybe you missed the \\'ilk\\' part) lol @combsco i\\'m going to make you a dreamweaver tribute page (i\\'m sure i can find a discounted version somewhere) i\\'m not advocating dreamweaver  for pete\\'s sake even worse lol (frontpage) i love how everybody is a css expert (there are folks here who are, though) don\\'t front lol noo don\\'t do it @jbmartinez it\\'s a trap @cjleeuk i believe there is a nightmode that will be put into production no idea when @jbmartinez http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/start-programming-swift-ubuntu/ but i didn\\'t tell you about it you have a dark side? do you eat seals or use a lot of non sustainable styrofoam cups? @khalysi  (dark side) what are you going to build with this voodoo @khalysi  i wished /collapse worked on formatted (or even better un-formatted ) code (maybe it does now: haven\\'t checked in awhile)  @fatehbou19 that\\'s a pretty broad question..... are there particular things you\\'re having trouble (with)? if things are \\'ugly\\' in general, don\\'t worry: it\\'s a problem that many of us have i can wish @jbmartinez  @tedcode0 nope. the curriculum is targeted towards beginners  you don\\'t need prior coding knowledge @tedcode0  @combsco what\\'s the current % of coding time ( @combsco uses a time tracker (with app categories)) winamp was cool run it in wine ftw penguin actually, if you want to talk about windows programs that actually work (i\\'m not a huge windows fan)... for sound editing goldwave (eval ware) is great (better than audacity imo) @rphares sprout intake check true nan nan it\\'s the swift (getting to her) ```/me your comment``` i want coffee wtf?

no do you see why having an id fired that i saw (in the first iteration) a lot of class names that don\\'t exist anywhere... my guess is you\\'re confusing (dom) element selectors vs. class or id selectors  hang on @bulldogmolly i think this might help http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp (you need this first before you can get to the other stuff) @bulldogmolly yeah i know but i think you\\'re extrapolating something from the lessons incorrectly (just a feeling) @bulldogmolly there\\'s also a bootstrap nav (since you\\'re using bootstrap)  the whole point of the portfolio is to bang your head against the wall :smile:  you\\'re doing great do they have bogo welcome @rvrajavijay94  @rsmith731 \\nlogo:``` http://codepen.io/bootstrapped/details/kwygwq/ ```(this person\\'s pen is interesting)\\nlogo with text: (note whoever did this \\'fiddle\\'didn\\'t put a lot into link quality/hosting)http://www.bootply.com/f6dapkmdkt  @kennikuyou do you have a pen link (can look at in both browsers) @brandonay probably the latter is a good approach.... until you reach beginning algos (then time to read up) sure @kennikuyou  k depends.... sudo is safer than dropping to a root shell @kennikuyou am gonna rawgit it https://rawgit.com/kennikuyou/mse-store/development/index.html  (so others can look as well) @kennikuyou i don\\'t see any difference in rendering (apart from small browser diffs)\\n> hey guys ive got a question, i have a full width and height header and a logo in the center with text below. it renders perfectly on chrome but when i open the page in mozilla, some of the text goes below the header right under the next section, how is this happening?

(and doc ready might help too) @96street you\\'re right i looked at that for a lightening second before switching to something else (my bad) @96street but let\\'s step back... for a second am looking at it now @96street are you really sold on putting stuff like events in tags? @michaelmrose what is that? yeah it seems they are conflating  true but they are selling two things totally unrelated like \"we are an earth moving business that focus on js based apps\" totally different @anthonya97 broken image link here beware the penguin solid kubuntu/xubuntu/various windows vm(s)....  try installing vmware on it and tryout linux  dual boot yes i\\'d keep that partition ntfs oh, different drive yeah i got a dual drive setup too on one of my boxes  ubuntu you can get stuff done i like to tinker with distros but sometimes i just want crap to work when i need it (hence the \\'buntu based distros) arch does have great documentation mint is derivative of ubuntu (or was) .... but a little different.  not a bad distro @rphares where do you weigh in  i used to kind of like enlightenment desktop (either over *buntu or over *buntu via bodhi) puppy is a great thing to have on a usb.. puppy has some issues (imo) with their security model true but everything that\\'s root user right off the bat.. is problematic i like puppy for its utility factor (keeps an .sfs file where you want it either on same usb or another drive) has lots of stuff if you need it you\\'re a mac user huh? ( @rphares ) i have a working theory @anthonygallina1 yeah they actually have default wallpapers of puppies omg @rphares hates puppies (what?) you can\\'t own a puppy you befriend it (sigh, you and your *western* ways @rphares  yes this is why.... i agree @rphares why do you not like puppies i must know what was that movie with the mean woman played by glenn close who did **not** like puppies no that\\'s not it ok, wait she didn\\'t like rabbits  wrong movie yeah ^ no, i was just noting how she went from an intense (psychopathic not mean) role in that movie to sort of  mean in the disney movie ( kind of like ice cube the rapper doing family movies ..weird how careers go after time) never heard of it no such thing @revisualize how did they rope you into that clause? (that\\'s pretty broad) i\\'m talking about the latter \\'intangible property clause\\' what are the outer limits of that? hmmm they sound like d\\' bags if you developed something unrelated to what that/your company does would that contract language attempt to press ownership on **your** intellectual property? i understand the non-compete clause (not an attorney thank you very much) but the second part sounds a little shady @revisualize yeah, defiantly the bad blood part (gotta eat)... but i read that paragraph as  \"you have to let them know, they have to keep it confidential (patents, processes, etc., and *you* would be responsible for filing any associated paperwork with \"stuff\" to whatever entity. you\\'re agreeing to disclosure; but not permission (putting your code code on github doesn\\'t seem to me something that they can enforce -- but again, not an attorney--- that just sort of pisses me off to hear   yeah, that\\'s usually the case @revisualize  you got off cheap i\\'m going to say react @anisk1992 (looking forward to it. not looking forward to it) it was in the curriculum until recently  these backticks are different night @willtravelforfun you asked that in english oh, but your english is so good lol but that was kind of a random question @willtravelforfun  nan do note that this is an international room wait @willtravelforfun  not crazy but there will be a transition there @eurisko79  @willtravelforfun didn\\'t actually state **why** she needs this @eurisko79 all valid reasons @willtravelforfun yeah, typically you preface *why* you\\'re doing something (helps with participation) ... like if if you say \"give me your finger\" people instinctively want to know *why*   i\\'m convinced @willtravelforfun is building some robot with ~~austrian~~ a german accent but not really giving us much detail yes, put your own spin on it @willtravelforfun .... make that cyborg model do things like vacuuming and being an uber driver ...  yeah it\\'s been done so many times change its hair too ^ that image is being pulled up from konsole (kde default terminal) .... but is that from blender? @sludge256 you\\'re right (has .jpg) extension but the original modeling looks pretty 3d blender\\'ish (exported maybe to .jpg) i\\'d like to learn blender --- sitting on one of my machines collecting dust learning curve looks a bit steep  @eeflores thanks that looks pretty cool oh, great i take back the brownies phuey paaaa tang lol not a bad thing to know about though even if it\\'s more difficult well, i\\'ve been here for 3 hours.. and i feel like a new person now that i know how to make cabinetry @sshashankk   when i get to finish sanding (i think it comes later) i will let you know this is free cabinetry camp right?  oooh, ascii batman fail lol @simulatedgreg these are good things yeah me too any other things you\\'d like to share @simulatedgreg  the simulated version may decide that it likes being yes perhaps you\\'re overcompensating because the real greg is, well, real.... no? how did you come to be simulated? (there\\'s a link back to original in some object philosophy) ubuntu no, use ubuntu you\\'re just starting out with linux? use ubuntu  gnome is cleaner ...kde is more resource heavy but good for workflow (screen edges... and you can pimp the hel^ out of it)... but you can go with a lot of desktops gnome, fallback, plasma(kde).. mate, cinnamon, enlightenment..... or go with a lighter tiling thing like dwm  straight forward/clean xfce noooo not that just a bit @durablemicron did your font inherit the background color? @durablemicron yeah that\\'s part of it (i suspect) but there\\'s some other stuff going on  hang on @durablemicron you know you can do click events from jquery right?  (as an aside) @durablemicron you have background-color and color (white) in your body class... remove that (color in class) and see what happens. (this is what\\'s causing your issue) white text against white background = invisible ink how come hexchat not* i tried that... seem to work pretty well (although i got list of all rooms except this one) pita wait you can\\'t see your own messages? that\\'s weird @willtravelforfun can\\'t top your desire to create a domesticated t2 cyborg go are you going to actually tell us what \\'this\\' is or is it a pause for maximum anticipation effect welcome @medetm  i wanna see the mockup you have to do the mockup yes if you\\'re the idea creator waiting for your own mockup is weird although, if you had multiple personalities that could be technically be possible @onmywayprogram what have you tried so far? you can see your own messages with just irc? (not generated from gitter client) i\\'m going to try to digest you don\\' t know js first @awesomeaniruddh did you go on some sort of js pilgrimage?  yeah, totally .... see that hmmm at all? (like not a delay) no, i\\'m not on hexchat at the moment (have to fire up another box) is it just this room or other too? others this room in particular gave me problems for some reason yeah, the 40,000 + could be the \\'some reason\\' lol there\\'s a blog post http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/06/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it.html oh, so it does it in small # too  weird with different clients as well ? slider icon top (notifications settings) i got nothing yeah, i wondered about that there were like 4-5 heya hang on @sriharshakappala  you have to say h-ello world (dash omitted) see like that welcome @sriharshakappala , @paulgaudet  nothing wrong with reinforcing learning concepts from multiple sources @abhisekp so what do you think about gitter next panel same here... can\\'t find sign-out i may have to things like sign-out are important (kind of like mcdonald\\'s saying \"there will be no ketchup anywhere in store (after upgrade), please enjoy your day\")  @qmikew1 wants ~~ketchup~~ sign-out back oh, well gave it a try gitter (browser) yes, i can just close tab/window but i like the functionality  oh, yeah... (gitter next) @abhisekp yeah, i was trying to give it a chance though @danybr0 welcome what\\'s the challenge name? do not use with the ability to use (brilliant) yes i did totally it was the slider it is pretty but no worky yeah you can collapse... but i think the menu (when enabled) is way too big mega menu bwah hah hah i don\\'t think i am, let me check i\\'ll check that too malibu, india yes... though in the flavor of kanji close (serenity)  atm i wonder if/when github will have a serious competitor  yeah, no matter how great something is.... i get nervous if \\'it\\' is the only (or effectively so) the game in town. competition is good. totally think about that for a moment still no welcomes @combsco  hi no yeah i am dba track (i didn\\'t see the numbering either) @sludge256 ok, yeah it\\'s right there (i just clicked register ) so it\\'s m102 @psrijan i\\'m in the u.s. *and* in front of a laptop @meat147 just to note that fcc switched to react (vs. angular course) - but for me (not necessarily angular...but in general) it brings sort of a modular approach to what could be termed a webapp (sort of pulling a bunch of disparate web stuff into more of a traditional approach).... here\\'s a [quora post](https://www.quora.com/what-are-the-advantages-of-using-angularjs-over-jquery) the author is talking about angular over jquery but i think you can infer the advantages in general with approach (angular or react) tables are so unloved  even when it\\'s appropriate (not some 90s styling hack) i feel wrong somehow using a table (even for tabular data).  the table pendulum has swung too far the other way. columns + rows unite!!!! @darrynwu29 no, (and in that context, it\\'s a good thing) @penguinofthesky do you have a pen link to mess with? oh nvm don\\'t do that lol awesome hail the table and the :chicken:  @sludge256 do you feel weird using table (even though that it\\'s appropriate in that context)? lol so, no or yes (table guilt)? tables are like smokers now shunned and in the cold vs. a billion to assuage your table guilt oh, you\\'re definitely a rebel  but i\\'m talking tabular not evil 90s  btw according to the matrix universe reality stopped and everybody was stuck with win 98 well it was small er https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_04 i\\'m not an angular expert sorry errant answer to a question i saw floating by in my gitter next view @darrynwu29 what was your favorite win 98 feature i liked the default cloud(s) wallpaper.... but am reaching for something more (memory faded) java has a weird trend zigzag.... and  the python trend seems wrong (imo) but awesome thing to envision/realize (expansion of curriculum) :+1:  @sludge256  yes! (embrace thy relational) finally  those are the best, and should be on the value meal @darrynwu29 i switched to linux primary about a decade ago still use windows in vm(s).... (because i can\\'t avoid it) missing design tools? serenity gimp and inkscape i use ps too, but those aren\\'t really \\'design\\' tools in the sense of development.... (if you\\'re printing stuff, sure) @darrynwu29 about three days and fireworks isn\\'t bad i use that too sometimes @darrynwu29 i\\'m not a front end dev hmmm growth is good, but does it become unmanageable  if you stray from core competencies or focus becomes less precise?  excited about the change also, just wondering out loud are you talking about bootstrap\\'s navbar \\'brand\\' element? @heruvimi  you\\'re too picky bring marshmallows  @pgjones72 when you say you **can\\'t** click something what do you mean? (or select etc., unclear) those are called pulls (btw ... yes they\\'re handles) @pgjones72 what kind of device are you using @pgjones72 (browser wouldn\\'t be bad to include - hardware probably not necessary).... but you are placing your mouse pointer in the text editor area and you can\\'t type anywhere? (do you have any blockers?, did it work on other exercises?) @pgjones72 oh, whoops didn\\'t see last post. glad it\\'s working now trout slapping is discouraged @asiyoko  @floydivvi if you like data, yep true gitter wasn\\'t meant for a team of 50,000 people @spatzerny why not get a snake or a fish? (your less legs, less trouble logic seems to point to animals with no legs) well @spatzerny did try to change the subject with his \"ideal cat\" (odd but different subject) there\\'s a reason why you don\\'t use a miter saw to cut your fingernails @spatzerny  http://www.husqvarna.com/us/products/chainsaws/240/967177101/ random unsolicited recruiter email. \"i would appreciate your **prompt** response\"... yeah, f\\' you... (ok, i didn\\'t but felt like it) put your resume out that\\'s the issue @davidpmacneil  these people are nowhere near my state some yes, some no. but in general... recruiting from somewhere (there\\'s the distinction) very far away is a little sketchy (even in the interconnected model of tech (imo)) i am not drew barrymore (fire starter) my adventures with recruiters doesn\\'t relate to front end dev - btw  but, i\\'ll be glad when i complete the course (it\\'s great) and will be happy to add certs to existing stuff (don\\'t know the immediate impact... but i think it will be positive) what templating are you using? ah, classic panel back again that was an adventue adventure ecven or even ty ty @rphares  sidebar is pretty but not functional sounds interesting (who would be bored by that? pppht) got  where (next?) no clue what @rphares  (nods \"ok\") is talking about @rphares now you\\'re grabbing stuff from torrents?  (the slide has been most severe) tisk, tisk @qmikew1 glare uh, uh feign sure oh lol it\\'s funny how an avatar (which can be anything from an image of mac and cheese, to a mountain) can affect the way people perceive /talk to you -- case in point: @cerebr4l  hello new person @jbmartinez .... beware of the penguin @jbmartinez i\\'m still thinking the nun disguise is your best chance to escape mordor  i don\\'t have hard percentages of chances for success @sludge256 what kind of fcc data? (file serving convo) @nickejanssen linking the pen would probably yield the quickest answer i like pink. i like kanji nan nan totally random.... and no i don\\'t believe that ( @rphares is so darn nice that i like to give her a hard time) hello, goodbye  @nickejanssen i suppose people can rawgit it if they want .... the link should be sufficient sprouts @nickejanssen you weren\\'t kidding (that is complicated -- ) vegan salami is a heavy metal band from taiwan i don\\'t mind veggies.... but i also don\\'t mind meat especially meat that\\'s been grilled with oak sometimes bbq sauce and oak chips makes meat taste better !!! @alicejiang1  (am practicing enthusiastic hello) burger king has a veggie burger... (not half bad) ah five guys... is great  i like the peanuts in the lobby at 5 guys lobby / waiting area  i don\\'t think there\\'s one near me now (i enjoyed said food when living in/near different city) they have a place called \\'cook out\\' or something  in nc not the same but kind of tasty @rock-a  welcome @cmrandall what kind of error? @cmrandall do you have a pen of this (my guess though it\\'s local) bad for hair follicles  yeah, that\\'s what i do nan nan nan yeah oh, whoops i wish i were cool like me too nan that\\'s so wrong..... lol btw @combsco i don\\'t think you can take back tagging someone even though you delete message i do too if your choice of technologies is driven by making the acronym sound coherent that\\'s an issue (stack talk) @brianborin no hard /fast rule. it\\'s up to you... when you get to the projects you will be doing a lot of \\'doing\\' and \\'reading/viewing, skilling up\\' no prune here or gooseberries (wtf are those) i get bad title \"]\" lol the slang part of that  is interesting  (article) yeah i didn\\'t know that now i want bananas they rule not in wine though eww heya @dajust  i\\'m so done with winter no, nc. but i\\'m glad it sucks for you as well :smile:  yes politics yeah, tech people are weird... but not everybody is like milton (actually one of the few non-tech people in the movie) in the basement hacking away at code without interfacing with people (in fact, you need communication/social skills). linky the pens (pure styling theory no worky when troubleshooting) how is camperbot commenting on issues? ------> you bought your own app? how did you bungle it yeah, that\\'s an interesting idea (app) put some hot sauce in it you\\'re good to go i\\'m not an array @gitwmkovacs  i want to hear more about the stew nan nan laptop yeah, i like it you\\'re not off the hook on the stew thing apparently she made some sucky stew i had to google that. looks totally yuppie lol that\\'s actually pretty god god? good is it capped at 60? probably don\\'t want to commit to doing serious cooking a billion times a week though yeah, the one-off ingredients do end up costing more ... if you\\'re making something you haven\\'t before (or something including said ingredient) so, it sounds interesting welcome @esocomputing  @esocomputing not so much a 1:1.... there was a lot of *additional* stuff added @esocomputing i came in june or july  so, were there tar pits at that time? lol ok, ok already ... geez they linked to codecademy for basic js what kind of pudding corn? why do keep adding that **one** ingredient to everything? like all your recipes sound great.... but then there\\'s some extra ingredient that makes it weird node is fun (painful) but fun do you do backend now? angular is hard yeah but you\\'re already a senior front end dev lol is there a reason to follow you (vs. self interest)? @libanthedev  welcome @anok  face palm welcome @lynne78  see ya i\\'m slowly being turned on codepen pro not there yet.. but yeah that part is cool yeah i see a lot of pro accounts in featured  come to think of it magic lol yes that sucks why i complete things locally and paste stuff into pen (and i prefer using my own tools) i\\'ve settled on the fact that cert requirements are going to change and are open-ended (not a critique)... but this sort of mirrors reality of change ... yep they retire certs i\\'m not discouraged by the changes from a learning standpoint... but kind of makes me think of the old desktop application paradigm where companies would throw every feature into something until it became something other than its core  @sludge256 it\\'s funny though i\\'ve seen people complaining about the tribute page being too hard (can\\'t win) lol i just went down a memory lane rabbit hole with mugatu (thanks @sludge256 ) that\\'s actually something, i\\'ve wondered (the messages after completion ) where do they come from? (i get most of the references because i\\'m a gen-x(r)) what @willtravelforfun is buying a yacht? nan nan nan nan nan nan i know but you\\'ll get yacht work welcome @sidneeginger  there\\'s a university named after an abba song? nan nan my english sucks though i\\'m a native speaker i was waiting for my @abhisekp greeting ty  ty tax tax @abhisekp  @yoqu i get a lot of that (are you chinese, etc.).... my avatar is in kanji (yes, same common roots) there are (indirectly) api things in projects welcome @jeffersoncn  :sweat_drops:  ty, ty @rphares  random factoid (i didn\\'t know this as was going for some humor with @abhisekp \\'s \\'hello fellow ....\\' greeting is -- hindi is a sov language i guess it would be like learning japanese) you get embroidered mittens made by elfs if you reach 3000+ points ( you\\'d have to ask @rphares  ) now you\\'re thinking but no full coverage ok you know the question @rphares  no not sprout check.... stew check (and you should eat dinner) @yoqu thank you i will try to make it more interesting lol they liked it?

(i\\'d drop the animations (or limit ) under the skill section) again, it\\'s a tossup between \\'you don\\'t know js\\' and the free codeschool weekend for me well i don\\'t **have to** but it\\'s hard (for me at least) to digest complex topics *and* do a billion other unrelated exercises (i.e., free code weekend).... sometimes you gotta step back and focus on one thing i think that\\'s the follow-up edition @revisualize  well, yeah... but that has a sales pitch feel to it (limited time!) do, it ...do, it.... how are you not making my point again? sigh i may do it your logic is hard to argue @revisualize  @buguinha69  welcome you can actually check the specific regex if you\\'re that interested @jasondeving  no the actual regex used with camperbot although python sounds good i like its data (centric) value  if you get into top 10 you have *a chance* to win a free year  yeah right that\\'s not learning, that\\'s insane cram-o-thon like all you can eat (they know you\\'ll hurl before 8pm) nan i don\\'t want to be called nubby fingers  no no i don\\'t lie about lists how much more honest can you be to say that you should worry about sleep deprivation when cooking  night @revisualize  tony i - rocks well, not everybody is a cool as you @alicejiang1  yeah i said your by accident @buguinha69 .... don\\'t take codeschool free weekend as some sort of benchmark for your learning free/not free cramming has questionable value well their \\'free\\' weekend certainly works in terms of marketing value (it\\'s been the topic for awhile now) @buguinha69 they do now (hence marketing) yep actually, (and i will give kudos @awesomeaniruddh because he went on a js pilgrimage and came back using terms like \"enlightenment\"etc.,) i\\'m back on \\'you don\\'t know js\\' (more in depth) for weekend vs. the free weekend stinkin badges @alicejiang1 thinking back on earlier comment .... since you don\\'t *have to* what would you rather do ?

@combsco , @combsco  you mean formatting said code in gitter? explain format i want the fortran room... please help ty ty where\\'s the :blush:  yes i see a future in this sigh hmm that\\'s a bit ironic @combsco what have you done to make @rphares get to the edge of marginally snarky not here it isn\\'t lol do you know js or do you **know** js? @sketchgoddess not everybody wants to use bootstrap @sketchgoddess i don\\'t mind bootstrap, but in terms of your question \"why would you do this, when you can do this\"?... do you really want a single entity defining all design? there are other grid approaches (btw) @sketchgoddess not saying good vs. bad.....   css-tricks is pretty handy in some ways i find css harder than js  nice happy code that (usually) does what it\\'s supposed to - css on the other hand  it\\'s a good read try \\'you don\\'t know js\\' also, yes the philosophy of js is an endeavor no doubt what i don\\'t get is folks don\\'t know js but find it cool to hate on jquery (a lib).... learn some stuff then critique (you won\\'t know *how* something sucks or doesn\\'t suck without having some sort of foundation for understanding) @sketchgoddess on the spa note..... you\\'ll get *why* you need js pretty quickly @combsco how much do you spend on your nails? wait @sketchgoddess do the course that\\'s the point you have a lot of questions ,  but what questions to ask will come with actually learning the material - just sayin are you kidding, i don\\'t think there\\'s a tip big enough for some poor soul to touch my feet  you have to force yourself to learn what you don\\'t know..... if you want to move forward. it\\'s scary and can be a pita ... but that\\'s the point of learning no? sigh ok, @combsco you seem to be fixated on my nails (for whatever weird reason) what do you want to know yeah it\\'s friday... i\\'m catching up @combsco mine was \"i appreciate your **prompt** reply\"  i was like wtf and in a different state prompt this @combsco yeah i did a phone interview recently @alexgeo007  you have to make one there is no fa fcc glyph icon i made my own i read that there was a request to make an fcc icon, but don\\'t know the status (if you\\'re using native fa i don\\'t know how... but i could be late to the game) lol lol i believe you i still believe you lol meh, doesn\\'t bother me either way @combsco are you going for an analyst position making friends you are a lot of companies are spinning down physical offices (jobs and all that fun stuff)  and the extra load goes to your coworkers. they might be *slightly* sensitive right now  and might not like you photographing their yodas i think that\\'s positive i\\'m working on my @rphares tribute page i thought more a retrospective in terms of browneis or brownies as some call it wordpress kind of pushed even further @anisk1992 nothing happens  that would be the worst avatar ever no i don\\'t 100% certainty and distribution i\\'m still not blonde (nor do i wear a headset) thank god lol so, i was trying to look at the ajax call but was pulled back into gitter he^^ i don\\'t have a beard nor do i typically wear aviator sun glasses (that\\'s even too 80s for me) ok i do have a mouth though and nostriles no not even close awesome what is it @jorgon1022  @jorgon1022 are you using just vanilla js?

that\\'s only like to coke cans worth two* oh, i forgot the serving size differences but still we\\'re talking quantity of said precious (coffee) liquid i actually never considered its caffeine content nice i will have to pick your brain for your coffee expertise  @qmikew1 makes note  styro is the best tasty and takes 200 hundred years to decompose lol @lalux what\\'s the name of the exercise/challenge @devonwilson1 there\\'s a lot of stuff that probably needs tweaking (so your question may not be as simple without some prerequisite stuff).... you may want to start moving away from internal styling and put your css in its own pane (codepen). you have bootstrap as an external resource; however, there aren\\'t really an bootstrap elements (rows, columns etc.,) you may want to look at examples from/in: http://getbootstrap.com/css/ hi ty ty  where\\'s the blush i\\'m not blonde that\\'s what i want blue leds and all yeah same  though right now on just laptop... is the stream actually streaming (see chat activity but no vid) running this (twitch stream) is easier through livestreamer/vlc... now if i can find a way to access chat without browser i would be happy (note to self do some research) twitch have irc? camperbot is sentient **it** lives echo i\\'m saying qmike said, but it\\'s really me camperbot saying this: \"i\\'m sentient\" echo have a nice day. i missed something in the stream...the part about bringing all the additional languages into the fold hal bot or halibut  :fish:  @berkanan imgur blocks codepen you may want to crossorigin me it what are you talking about @qmikew1 hands @spatzerny a doughnut in hopes that his blood sugar levels stabilize  not bad yes, image now renders looks good :shipit:  what? how so, not following that\\'s pink ---> on the high end  but you said is it too purple are you talking about a bootstrap nav? https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/ go with pink do it so, @sludge256 i used livestreamer (terminal invocation is easy). not bad. if i can get an irc connection with twitch chat, i\\'d be totally happy heya @darrynwu29  @sludge256 oh yeah (thank you) now i\\'ll rock vlc side by side with hexchat @sludge256 is that what you were using today (in terms of chat) yeah, the token part i was like hmmm the popout looks better agree on \\'blocky\\' (and by inference no \\'do \\'ey\\') but http://www.sitepoint.com/delay-sleep-pause-wait/ i had to do something similar (without regard to ui) so you can emulate a wait/sleep  formatted code spam @iamalexnguyen passion for know what i don\\'t know *knowing show, the code.... show, the code..... (does chant) @qmikew1 evokes imagery of cannibals singing pre-dinner chant @bunnyvishal6 tell us a little about your code (since i\\'ve seen it x3) @bunnyvishal6 one of the things i see is that your third array (after its iterations are exhausted) will eventually equal the first array\\'s value. you have a function in there called subs, that does stuff but doesn\\'t return a value... so when it\\'s called later on (with different arguments) it really just keeps doing the same thing. (confused) @bunnyvishal6 have you tried reduce (it\\'s a tip in the instructions) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/array/reduce ??? i think you\\'re trying to implement its functionality without using it.... the only other thing, i\\'d say is that i think you\\'re trying to do a callback (maybe i\\'m misinterpreting ) but your function(s) look more side effect (doing stuff/not returning stuff) .... @bunnyvishal6 you\\'re welcome (and you\\'re forgiven for posting the code three times lol) winter sucks (i must include that once a day until winter is over) that\\'s not what you have @dylandknight (at least in this iteration of the pen) look at 106 in html pane (nested so it\\'s right below 105) you have <a> @dylandknight the underlining is an (after) effect.... but when i hover over ```about tesla ``` heading, its behavior is that of a link (i.e., the heading and the paragraph neither i think you intended to anchor)... i\\'d look at all the anchors preceding to see if you closed those @dylandknight so, in other words the takeaway is: yeah, you can change the default underlining; however, there\\'s another issue there  -if it\\'s not a link then it would not have a visited state but that should be a big clue no? (that stuff that isn\\'t an anchor is acting like an anchor) @dylandknight it\\'s in the image anchors (try as an experiment to cut (you can paste back) the four anchors associated with the four images (you will see the hover behav disappear) these two lines are the offending:\\n```\\n<a><img class=\"img-thumbnail img1\" src=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/us613809-1.png \" </a>\\n        <a><img class=\"img-thumbnail img1\" src=\"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/us1119732-0.png \" </a>\\n``` (is my guess) yw welcome @dontrish1993  ( @bunnyvishal6 :thumbsup: ) what starbucks? you say i **must** visit you you\\'re awfully demanding but okey dokey. hello i want to be a swedish  clog building artisan -- will this help? no, they make those in china now but still i want to learn and am undeterred  @sludge256 so, you jumped on the free codeschool bandwagon oh, so you **can** grab those (i thought they would have limited that) @kristinavandoren those are pretty clogs (i didn\\'t think i would hear myself saying that in any context) ugh, yeah that\\'s a lot of manual work  are you scripting said grab yeah, good thing we don\\'t do that here hmm nan i haven\\'t even logged into this free thing (codeschool weekend  nan i\\'m not going to cram, cram with codeschool  i actually like to digest things @mariejlopez gasp @danstockham i know the feeling (in general)  there\\'s a wild sludge? :+1:  get sh__t done ok, the **one** thing that annoys me is people who have the \\'whistle\\' alert sound (you know the one) @joel789456 what\\'s the pen link  [![selection_111.png](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/dhbp/thumb/selection_111.png)](https://files.gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/dhbp/selection_111.png) @joel789456 so, what is the issue (see some stuff but not a big deal imo)  with the way it\\'s rendering on mobile  could use full  though i like the effect @joel789456  (but to your question in mobile the relative positioning  with bootstrap is the problem --- actually @storbeck is css ninja -may want to ask him)  either way when the viewport changes it\\'s going to get skewed ^ that\\'s what i was saying however, too bad i\\'m done lol @alicejiang1  i\\'ve noticed no hello are you doing codeschool how can you miss all the pink <--- <----- i suspect that taco bell\\'s beefy frito burrito is not healthy cool @atticakes and welcome lol i get , i get it.... @alicejiang1  @zarina04 welcome and @gcg121 ,.... welcome @evaderei you know the answer deep down don\\'t you? an 80s band that completely seemed to pass me by (in the 80s) was tygers of the pang tang -- heya @akiralaine  what notebook lol or you could get suckered into a browser based service yeah, that\\'s the problem they know it\\'s sweet and charge accordingly  totally mirrors reality omg how many bricks is that (well i could count) but still probably good around the holidays  where i thought everybody was busy downloading all of codeschool\\'s free crap ^ the timing of @akiralaine \\'s post is funny lolol  @combsco what is that (avatar)? @bwandls the moth room is over there it\\'s doesn\\'t look like deadpool it looks like spiderman with a samurai pony tail i\\'m talking about @combsco \\'s avatar (scaled down) or a small pickle growing out of his head wait, i\\'m talking about an avatar yeah pretty much but i think nerds are just itching to talk about deadpool (i could have mentioned asparagus ..same result) what? asparagus? no way you can bet on it i don\\'t mind the orange and green looks good wait there\\'s orange text with a green \\'let\\'s get started button\\' oh olive not \\'green\\' like olive is not a shade of green is it? yeah the button didn\\'t i say button (forgot) oh ok.... yeah that\\'s right i like that color i\\'m not i said i like it take a compliment already sheesh lol oh, i see this makes sense now soon he\\'ll be \\'i love you guys\\' welcome @paulapivat  oooh @storbeck is it possible to create an svg (i\\'ve asked this generally before but..) say like in inkscape and be able to access its meta stuff (xml, blah, blah) and animate it with css? hmmm can i change its properties. say like i had an object that i wanted to rotate (and had features to it so not smooth like globe) it  @lawlietblack isn\\'t that 1/2 way point thing (i forgot) hang on  @lawlietblack ask in here: https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/halfwayclub (i\\'m guessing you\\'ll get a better answer) yeah i remember that you too \\'not-just alice\\' there nickname solved meh yeah he went all out there\\'s a bit of a spectrum from meh, to hating on something their stuff is well produced (high production value points -- super snazzy ) awesome @tbaotran  it is i actual see things in their stuff that they don\\'t intend directly omg welcome @thorboy666 . is there any reason my mouse is moving on its own? are you a chiropractor?  ooooh @thorboy666 that\\'s really interesting... why the coding interest?

(i.e., you have static text) @fedayn oh, i see what you mean ```full``` vs. ```edit``` no, not working ... let me look at your settings @fedayn still looking at it @fedayn i think in full view (i.e., your code works in edit vs.) you have full browser going -- i\\'m not sure about the listener (why not click https://api.jquery.com/click/)  -- but i think that has something to do with it (others may want to comment) but i don\\'t think it\\'s the settings in codepen - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/eventtarget/addeventlistener , --some indirect discussion of it as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2398099/jquery-equivalent-of-javascripts-addeventlistener-method well we\\'d be stuck with roman numerals (that didn\\'t work out so well without zero) negative numbers still break peoples\\' brains ahhhh no you suck lol @rphares  (in a nice way, bailing and all) it\\'s all too complex no, we must keep roman numerals lol @cloudbuster you can choose any person, idea, org whatever... but it looks good i don\\'t think it was coffee at any point riveting chat @combsco yes although i fear you\\'re going to change it for some reason no, blue yucky nan are you moving away from jquery @krizzu  ? oh @aigog you can use console.log() and click f12 (it may also render in the in-built console) .... but you may want to go for something like repl.it https://repl.it/languages/javascript @aigog try f12 (that\\'s the browser level console) @jp2kk2 i would add a link to (i.e., for more info about x topic).... but you\\'re conflating internal and external styling (i.e.,  putting style tags in the css pane) @jp2kk2 -- the css pane is a codepen representation of an external style sheet (like something.css) so you would make whatever class in that (css) pane (e.g., )\\n```.mygroovyclass{\\n/*some groovy stuff*/\\n}\\n```\\nand then you would reference that class on the html (pane) side like ```<div class=\"mygroovyclass\">whatever</div>```  grr gitter editing ```\\n.mygroovyclass{\\n/*some groovy stuff*/\\n}\\n``` newline f\\'s shi^ up .... but you get the picture (hopefully) eww depends do you have a scope of project description do i see cartier in there (now gone) looks like you have much to spend http://grammarist.com/spelling/spelled-spelt/ @jp2kk2 first issue you\\'re doing the same thing over and over... wouldn\\'t it be easier to put in  a class? @jp2kk2  ok, beyond that...though @adamdl first http://regexr.com/ ..... step 1 there\\'s a bunch of stuff in left pane that will help + you can mess with your pattern....

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21788187/javascript-better-way-to-modify-function-prototype (indirect) @liam345 i see a couple of things....1. you\\'re (in essence ) hard  coding the arguments (i.e., adding a,b,c,....)...instead, you probably want to look at the arguments object (link in the challenge)..2. also, it looks as though filter isn\\'t being used correctly (it takes callback)  @liam345 i don\\'t see a callback in the invocation (of/in the code you posted)..... the example in mdn might be helpful (in terms of concept... and yes, this is tough... i had a problem with it as well so don\\'t feel bad) \\n```\\nfunction isbigenough(value) {\\n  return value >= 10;\\n}\\nvar filtered = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].filter(isbigenough);\\n// filtered is [12, 130, 44]\\n``` but, this isn\\'t *the* answer.... but illustrative (i.e., applied a bit differently ) @liam345  so the wine idea went out the door, then ? that\\'s a always a nice note to get (not at all ambiguous ) lol i would have interpreted it differently  lol i got cheap a^^ powdered doughnuts from the convenience store i am going to enjoy these doughnuts (i had to suffer the dude with slippers (flipflops), sweat stained t-shirt, and really yellow \\'hawk talons\\' overlapping said slippers at the convenience store)  yeah they are sealed  yeah, let\\'s put some outriggers on that boat and get some marlin hiya @thecodejones ...welcome no, still dark..... i think i have to refresh ok, i see the new avatar now @alicejiang1 .... nice chicken chicken with stuffing coming out?  :chicken:  you just called the saint @jedpimentel very junkyard dog (classic pro wrestler) \\'esqe  (new avatar) oh, yeah... enjoy it while you can @thecodejones the program/curriculum etc., is pretty new: there are a lot of unknowns (imo); however, i think you\\'ll be better off knowledge wise with program (it\\'s pretty challenging, i haven\\'t completed it yet) unknown  some certs are valued more than others (and some not at all)..... really depends on the company/org here\\'s the thing..... you get the certs (complete all the requirements) and are qualified to work with the non-profits. this is the factor that i think is being missed (i.e., not cert(s)) alone) - you potentially get experience to add to your portfolio. never been to a code meetup. what\\'s the typical agenda for these things? yeah lol only thing i can find (in terms of common elements) there is typically a code of conduct.... but beyond that, it looks like the meetup, itself, drives the agenda? -- (so, who is running these things? the person (or persons) that post a meetup?) -- all so confusing  are there (coding) meetup rival gangs? @briancbarrow maybe you could apply the \\'hello world\\' (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) in codepen with this:\\nhttps://blog.codepen.io/2014/08/26/using-react-codepen/ -- i don\\'t know if that\\'s how you\\'re supposed to get it to run in cp  i tried adding babel too (to the hello world) couldn\\'t get it to render.... so looked at codepen\\'s blog thing on react @briancbarrow so, after you become a react ninja - you will offer pointers, right?

there\\'s stuff out there  @tyryanr but those (in general / whatever you end up with) are limited, if you have something that **you** want to build, you\\'ll be driven and get more out of it (imo) @rocksynth not following ?

(i want to use that) like the view is not just what the stylus is doing.... it\\'s showing the actual hand writing with stylus  (no the hand doesn\\'t exist on its own independent of a person) what answer do you think you\\'ll get ? (fcc of course) the best way to ensure something *doesn\\'t* work is to do a screencast of it i couldn\\'t jump out of plane i mean what if the person prepping the chute is like having a bad day or something i can see it now (me first day of skydiving) - (person prepping parachute) \"wow, this is scary\" -- back at the prepping ranch: \"that -insert expletive-! oh, yeah what was i doing? right got to prep this g- insert expletive- chute\" welcome @wleyes  ok, only one container left of the \\'bitter beans\\' (i.e., cooked a bunch of beans that turned out bitter and had to, literally, eat my own mistake) i can\\'t throw food out (makes me feel guilty) yeah totally jalapenos, garlic, onions, some pork goodness (stock that i had but it wasn\\'t bitter) something else, i forget though help us with what? camperbot really? dried beans, soaked... in crockpot no worky you want a bean note? lololol no, you got me.... i used \\'un-fresh\\' garlic no nan night fcc/mongodb/laser treatment class-mate http://www.ajinomoto-usa.com/ yeah  in my early years the name of that company was a popular rhyme nan nan yeah, it is pronounced that way but was stressed for effect omg alice cooper is looking really bad (and that\\'s saying a lot)  @dedz1990 for those whose solutions are not marked private @anthonygallina1 i\\'m thinking that\\'s what my grandmother would have looked like wearing a skull belt (alice cooper... scary thought) what s. korean guy totally not following don\\'t be a stranger @phajava \\n ok, @evaderei  still not following (the bam thing plus point up didn\\'t help @rphares ) you\\'re trying to make my head explode huh? tomorrow is not today @evaderei  @gitmazzone some people use two images one frosted one not to achieve that effect (gimp, ps) varchar? should be datetime (if you\\'re working with a relational db) you can convert datetime in queries (remember, there\\'s a difference in structure vs. returning formatting in say a report) ok, the bitter beans are beginning to taste good varchar is not a date format again, structure is abstracted in conversion functions for display didn\\'t see the original sql statement (but saw varchar and was like noooooo) lol i don\\'t think that link is long enough @anthonygallina1 i didn\\'t click link, but i\\'d say that\\'s steve vai and satriani in the background vai no matter how aged is insane (and always will be) heya @akiralaine  if there are business that do heavy cat photo application development, we will be well prepared ty, ty are you getting the most out of your (or other people\\'s) cat\\'s cuteness? - in the internet age, it\\'s important to have \\'cat cuteness\\' presence -- that\\'s why we, here, at \\'leverage-your-cat-for-profit-dev\\' strive to make your transition easy as pie.  @ryunaq \\'the background\\' or overlaid images in individual divs? yes, \\'leverage-your-cat-for-profit-dev\\'.... i just need to write a business plan (what could go wrong?) i like the contrast between @rphares \\' and @sludge256 \\'s input just what i need @ryunaq the \\'responsiveness\\' aspect has some pre-steps... if you\\'re going to use bootstrap my suggestion would be to review http://getbootstrap.com/css/ -- also, you may want to look into background-image, background-size (in your css class) @deron-rowlands nice. congrats.  nan @jedpimentel there\\'s a \\'secret\\' gitter font size called: \\'one screen, one letter\\'  close @ryunaq the question about \\'the background\\' vs. overlays in divs will make sense later though (imo) you should avoid too many pointless jquery animations (this is not where the power of jquery reveals itself (it\\'s more)) @arielleslie i\\'m going to need the lunar-color changing chart by cob. thanks heya @zersiax what\\'s shakin @zersiax more \\'fcc goodness\\' has been added lol @seansaibot i used an api however, some users opt for an array of values (or both array + api)  :metal:  that\\'s some camperbot love (note, parallel comment... haven\\'t experienced said behavior (ssl) on chrome in last login / access of challenges) @sludge256  (is it related to commit a couple of hours ago? (though looks unrelated (wiki)) k,k hey, what\\'s with the deleted messages @rphares (that\\'s my thing) one critique i have about mongo is their (whatever platform) stuff is difficult to install (although easier than popular vendor relational db equivalents ) yeah, wanted to sandbox in 15.10 or > -- there\\'s some stuff i need to tweak (although this has more to do with [upstart](http://askubuntu.com/questions/690993/mongodb-3-0-2-wont-start-after-upgrading-to-ubuntu-15-10) than mongo -- also, downloaded a version for windows 10 (just sort of a pita overall and reminds me of relational installs (so, it\\'s familiar)) @anthonygallina1 :metal:  @0x0936 :metal:  nan good timezone neutral greeting to you nan @sludge256 that reminds me (slackware comment) i\\'ve got this old netbook (with soldered mem, for all intents and purposes is really a pi with a keyboard and monitor) i\\'ve wanted to mess with (tried puppy, usb installs etc... etc.) i\\'m thinking of trying dsl on it (no, not a production box)  yeah super minimal yeah i\\'m trying to think of project for it do they dislike wifi in that building? or phone reception questions about what? are you going to answer some questions @jtlscout  @jtlscout how can i fuse a jalapeno with a potato? i want jalatato please help no, i want part potato + jalapeno.... not italian ice cream  @sludge256 i like that... but it would be pronounced \\'hal lat toe\\' and would lose the side benefit of gelato @rphares i can keep my figure even if i eat potatos @abhisekp you need to work on your \\'inner voice\\' (it\\'s being mean to you for no reason) @radascript json is the interchange format (transmitted from (in this case a quote generator api)) that you\\'d grab from. if you\\'re not using an api, it\\'s likely that you\\'d be pulling from an array (within your js code itself... not from an external text file. if you were grabbing json from somewhere like your own webserver, you\\'d be kind of making your own api) feeling better @abhisekp  ? beware double vision  omg emacs evangelist ---  although, the minimalist aspects are interesting (but no way ) evil cnn page (embedded media) i left tab open and started hearing this piano thing and was like \"geez turn down the stereo neighbor\" audio was flaking on me (using livestreamer) earlier with twitch  you get \\'best\\' or \\'worst\\' (and some other options) with livestreamer but that\\'s program flags yeah, i didn\\'t see the verbose option output just like a couple of lines of output (limited option set) arguments doesn\\'t do anything (you can\\'t act on it and only  has a length property) so, yeah... you have to convert it to an array.... but, aside from that do you see a difference in the following output:\\n```\\n[ [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 ], 2, 3 ]\\n{ \\'0\\': [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 ], \\'1\\': 2, \\'2\\': 3 }\\n``` mdn\\n> the arguments object is not an array. it is similar to an array, but does not have any array properties except length. for example, it does not have the pop method. however it can be converted to a real array:\\n\\nvar args = array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\\n @htmlnoob roll with it. the arguments object does have its uses but it\\'s kind of a weird \\'throw you for no reason\\' part of the challenge i was the same way  what no blush? i will welcome myself then welcome back!!!!  :blush:  me mine\\'s better welcome @osinfotechimphal :blush:  :deciduous_tree:  @rphares  (it came up first in sort) i have no idea the context of deciduous tree @cheie1990 you sure you have the right color in there? wait, what would i \\'just say\\'  \"aww\" to again? yeah, why not? should i go get some coffee while you\\'re typing? brb nan i have to admit i haven\\'t gone through the handouts in zip (instead have been doing the lectures/quizzes without it) - but the general approach that they\\'re using is the initial quiz answers are not graded (the homework is at the end of each week) - so, if it\\'s not a graded.. (don\\'t know if what you saw is or isn\\'t) then i\\'d assume that the lecturer is probably thinking \\'no harm no foul\\'... if it is then, yeah that\\'s a mistake; however, if a zip as been download x billion # of times, would what the fix be for that week? (probably have to change a bunch of stuff - in a short amount of time and throw everybody off)  --- @alicejiang1  yeah no doubt,  going forward .... would agree hmmm well, sure because the free course is also a path to an optional *paid* cert - so, there is some expectation of professional-level interaction (however, not making any judgments: 3rd-hand text is always a bit of wildcard lol)  my panel is all messed up <--- although, i did get to read a lot of folks telling me what my avatar means in chinese (it\\'s kanji..so in this context, japanese) - like i wouldn\\'t know that sheesh. yeah, just pick some random characters... done, done. of course, what kind of nut would pick something at random you might get \\'guano\\' as your cool kanji  nan although i\\'m thinking of changing it to an early dan ackroyd character @rphares i\\'m going to be trying to decode that now if she\\'s advertising something wouldn\\'t be helpful if people can read it? (i.e.,  the context would seem to suggest that not a lot of japanese speakers around) howdy hmm nan oh, yeah i\\'m not showing any leg i think dan ackroyd is better wait, on second thought  i should totally spoof @arielleslie \\'s (yes, she\\'ll see this) avatar with my own \\'shoes\\' shot @rphares google irwin mainway irwin mainway nan nan map is good about? no camperbot no, i actually thought the look of that akroyd character was funny as hell i also remember the bass-o-matic sketch/character yes nan wait, i\\'m totally generous  you\\'re leaving us @rphares  ? no, i mean in the context of the statement paying tribute to camperbot doesn\\'t remove you from the skynet list (when said bot apocalypse occurs ) implied questions? i totally don\\'t follow the implied question thing (this is going to drive me crazy) gasp you invoked thy poison singer well, i know who bret michaels is without googling there\\'s a clue @rphares  omg, what happened bret nan omg this means i went the official poison site (can\\'t believe i just typed that) yeah i can nan but gnr is actually my fav why, you ask....? why?  lol oh, yeah no, i think @sludge256 is suggesting that you\\'re dodging since we don\\'t know whats happening next week don\\'t know, she won\\'t tell us she\\'s being all \\'dodgy\\' and secretive  you need to make your own did they remove the shadow off those? (i recall either in gimp or ps i took that off) lol (copied as bitmap) then redid it in svg i think (have to look again) fa-fire is not the fcc icon make your own yep, i saw that too they still haven\\'t responded ok, you want to be a dev but making your own icon is too much trouble? me neither .... not as though spamming the issue for shameless +1\\'s  https://github.com/fortawesome/font-awesome/issues/6927 would be something i\\'d do ....no way yeah, i made my own too no idea yeah... that koala everywhere it\\'s a cute but vicious bear like thing eats stuff cra^^s a lot that\\'s the shadow (old) are they good eating? well no i pretty much eat only ugly animals cows chickens yeah chickens are ugly  although it\\'s subjective nan nan i\\'m a steak-and-chicken-fish-atarian \\'i had\\' twice? oh candy bar made from rose petals and formica  @goodm0urning can you link the pen can you post here @goodm0urning might get more input (and my panel is all messed up) @goodm0urning you have everything (including the nav in container) take a look at this https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/ you\\'re too nice nan nan i am the master of all things finnish ok, nvm no no, that was a totally unhelpful comment (i don\\'t know anything about finnish culture or language) wat those aren\\'t dishwasher capsules @spatzerny  no, that\\'s finish (like the finish on the glass or paint on a car) not finnish @rphares raisen bran..... yes/no raisin  fire bran would be bad nice welcome @rogicoy  welcome @datause  @liyenpermey i think the pauses in response(s) has to do with the \\'unknowns\\' in your approach (e.g., are you going to use bootstrap? are you going for parallax effect?) heya @krizzu  like what was suggested before, backgrounds to individual divs will overlap the background itself i\\'d read up on bootstrap though first their docs are pretty good no idea bless you baristas rule nooooo (and this isn\\'t for any selfish reason, no way) if all the baristas become web devs then what? i was going to say cool hair color.. (but it was the lighting)  @michajo2k3  the var outside of the function is causing the last test to fail @michajo2k3 yeah, i didn\\'t see your amended post. but recently variable scope has been added in challenges @michajo2k3 these might have been added after you started --- but yeah, the scope thing is good to know:\\n > global scope and functions\\nlocal scope and functions\\nglobal vs. local scope in functions # @combsco  wait, i was looking for the superscript gitter markup @twispi bootstrap overrides a lot of things you may or may not find some success with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20721248/best-way-to-override-bootstrap-css (ancient post but may work who knows) you can drag images into the chat window but if it\\'s code (formatted) text is better @randya you\\'re (we\\'re) encouraged to use a lot of resources.... you\\'re not going to get into super deep elements of js (with course alone); however, the course is pretty good and covers a lot of \\'stack\\' ty, ty (finally get a :blush: ) nan if your network is slow (like a coffee shop - like me) ...might want to go for the youtube vs. vimeo hd for the js questions  no emoji @khalysi  i actually saw cobol in a job posting i was, heh totally @tsampurna why is your link above the style section (that\\'s for assets (or referencing)  like css and js files)? mine either @oddissee are you trying to recreate the 90s? @jbmartinez i still haven\\'t tried doing [this](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/start-programming-swift-ubuntu/) on ubuntu but, i think @khalysi  is trying to wear us down with her swift antics lol can\\'t really run full blown stuff w/o apple hardware but looks like you can test basic language stuff in ubuntu with an opensource swift build on ubuntu @khalysi  dang i was hoping that you\\'d use your production machine as a swift *buntu incubator lol - doh, plan thwarted @jbmartinez  i could throw it in a vm but yeah, looks sort of a pita to get running i\\'m a total sucker for anything that has a *buntu build (in fact, if they open sourced the \\'common cold\\' (i\\'m thinking something else, but rhymes with jerseys) i would consider putting on a machine somewhere explain format @khalysi i primarily (have to fire up windows in vm(s) because i can\\'t avoid it) use linux... i\\'m not a huge mac fan; however, i might use one if i could throw a linux vm on it (never exclude anything -- there are some cool items for usage on a mac... that i could go for)'"
